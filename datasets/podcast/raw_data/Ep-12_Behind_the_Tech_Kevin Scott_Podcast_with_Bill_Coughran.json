And I think, \nto me, that's been one of the things that I think has bonded people to me over the years.\n[MUSIC]\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I'm your host, Kevin Scott, \nChief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \nIn this podcast, we're going to get behind the tech. We'll talk with some of the people who have \nmade our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they \ndid. So join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind\u0002the-scenes insights into what's happening today. Stick around. \n[MUSIC]\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hello and welcome to Behind the Tech.\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I'm Christina Warren, Senior Cloud Advocate at Microsoft.\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I'm Kevin Scott.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Today, we're going to be talking to a person that I have long admired, Bill \nCoughran. I met Bill when I was a young engineer at Google, and he was one of the executives \nrunning all of the very important bits there. Ultimately, Bill went on to run Search, \nInfrastructure, Security, Maps, Local, so this huge swath of all of the big, complicated, important \nthings at Google.\nAnd like in a prior life, he'd been an entrepreneur, he helped run a networking company, and \nbefore that he had been a computer science professor and was at Bell Labs running the \ncomputing sciences research division during a period where they invented things like the C++ \nprogramming language. So, I still to this day am slightly in awe of Bill, and he is the engineering \nexecutive I would like to be when I grow up. (Laughter.) \nCHRISTINA WARREN: I don't blame you. \nKEVIN SCOTT: So, I'm curious, Christina. Just like everyone else that is on the show, \nincluding me, you've had not necessarily a straightforward path into technology. I was just \nwondering, like, you know, can you tell us a little bit about what that path has been and which \nmentors you've had to help guide you as you sort of figured out your own journey?\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, definitely. So, before I joined Microsoft, I worked in media \nfor a decade, and I was a journalist and an analyst and reported mostly on technology and \nbusiness stuff. So, I did have tech and I've always had an interest in tech, but it was obviously a \ndifferent perspective.\nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n2\nAnd what's kind of great when you ask about mentors, I think my -- probably my biggest mentor \nwould be a man whose name is Jim Roberts\nHe was my editor-in-chief at Mashable for a time, and he previously was the deputy managing \neditor of the New York Times, and he's now currently the editor-in-chief and chief content \nofficer at Cheddar. And just he's got like this great longstanding like old school journalism \ncareer.\nBut what I love about Jim is A) we used to fight all the time, so he really kind of pushed me, \nright? Like we used to fight all the time. But B) he saw what was happening to the media \nlandscape, and he decided that he wasn't just going to sit back and not evolve. You know, he \nwas early on Twitter, he was early on embracing social and digital platforms, and really pushed \nto get the New York Times online and to make -- to bring the two divisions that used to be \nseparate, like to bring the print and the online part together.\nAnd so, when I switched careers, he was somebody that I kind of looked at, because he -- even \nthough he didn't switch careers, was willing to evolve and wasn't just going to stand back and \nhope that things continued the way that it'd always been.\nAnd so, even though we used to always fight, like I learned so much from him, and I continue to \nlearn so much from him.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, the thing that really always amazes me and inspires me about people \nwho are willing to spend their time mentoring others is that-- these people have extraordinary \ngenerosity in sort of taking the time and then sort of sharing their perspective. And like to be a \ngood mentor, I mean, it sounds like because you guys were like fighting all the time, like that \nrequires a lot of energy. Like that means that he cared enough about you and your success and \nwhat you were doing that he was willing to like fully engage with you and push, which is not an \neasy thing to do.\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Not at all. And I have to say the most gratifying thing is that in \nrecent years he's actually reached out to me for my input on different things, which has just felt \namazing. And I know that I can do the same with him, so yeah.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I bet that is -- that's really awesome. And one of the things that we're\ngoing to hear in my conversation with Bill is like Bill was one of the most influential mentors in \nshaping my career path. Like there were many, many moments where the advice that Bill gave \nme was perhaps the pivotal thing in like these very pivotal decisions that had these sort of long\u0002term repercussions for my life, and my family, and the people that I worked with.\nAnd you know he was incredibly busy at the time, and like he was incredibly senior relative to \nme. He somehow or another decided to take the time, like and I will -- I will always be grateful \nfor him.\nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n3\nAnd I've sort of had the same thing with Bill that, you know, it sounds like you have with your \nmentor where, I will try to return the favor to Bill and like help him out with some things that \nhe's working on.\nBut like maybe the -- you know, sort of the biggest reciprocity there is that I was so moved and \nso appreciative by what Bill was willing to do for me that like I try to do the same thing for other \nfolks. He's really informed like my philosophy on coaching and how I give advice to people, and \nlike he's one of the reasons why I more often than not will say, you know, yes when someone \nasks me for like a little tiny slice of time for advice.\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I love that. I love that so much. And I -- I can't wait to meet Bill.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it's awesome. So, let's go ahead and chat with Bill.\n[MUSIC]\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, next up we'll meet with Bill Coughran. Bill is one of my engineering \nheroes. He's a researcher, teacher, entrepreneur, and business executive whose career includes \nbig jobs like head of the computing sciences research division at Bell Labs, the birthplace of \nUNIX, the C and C++ programming languages and other technologies that are foundations of our \nmodern tech world. And Bill was SVP of Search, Infrastructure, Maps and Local at Google. \nBill is now a partner at Sequoia where he invests in, advises, and coaches tech entrepreneurs.\n[MUSIC]\nKEVIN SCOTT: The thing that I think everybody will tell you about Bill is he is just by \ntemperament and depth of knowledge one of the best people in the world to work with as an \nengineer. And everybody who's ever worked for Bill wants to continue to work for Bill as long \nas they possibly can. I'm thrilled that you are here with us today. \nI've been hesitant to ask you to come on because we've had lots and lots of people on the show, \nyou in some ways are the most intimidating one because I admire you so much. (Laughter.) \nBILL COUGHRAN: You're very kind, Kevin. Thank you for the invitation. And I also, as I \nthink you and some of the audience probably knows, I don't spend a lot of time doing public \nthings. But with a kind invitation, I'm very pleased to be here. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and we're delighted. So, I really want to get into your story. So, you \ngot your PhD in computer science --\nBILL COUGHRAN: Yes. \nKEVIN SCOTT: -- from Stanford. \nBILL COUGHRAN: No, I finished my PhD and then I went to Bell Labs. I did do work as a \ncommercial programmer while I was at Caltech, but that was a side job. But I went to Bell Labs \nand I did a lot of work in fluid modeling and semiconductor modeling early on. \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n4\nAnd then became interested in what today would be called distributed computing and kind of \nshifted to that. And then I was asked at some point to become the leader of a group, and then \nended up I stepped up a few steps and ended up as the head of the computing science research \ncenter. \nKEVIN SCOTT: So how did that transition go for you? I mean, I've always been interested in \nthis because you know I think the people who have worked for you and with you admire both \nyour ability as a like a technical leader as well as your technical ability. And, like, those two \nthings don't always go hand in hand. \nBILL COUGHRAN: Some people think they're inversely proportional. (Laughter.) The -- it's \ninteresting, I've always tried to read and explore different technology areas. My sense is, Kevin, \nyou're the same. And so I try to stay conversant. I also try to develop relationships with people \nthat I work with who I believe are experts in the areas that they understand more deeply than I \ndo. \nAnd I just try to synthesize as much as I can, but over the years, I've also learned like it's silly of \nme to descend into the code in a major project because I can't contribute that -- in that way \nanymore, but I can think about how does it fit in end to end? What are the constraints it's \noperating under? You know? There are often big choices about what to do in terms of the basic \nalgorithmic approach and so forth. And I try to stay current with that. \nBut over the years, it's funny, I shifted away from the numerical modeling stuff, even though it's \nsort of come back in the form of machine learning and became much more deep on the \ndistributed systems side. But you can learn new things. \nOne of the things that always amused me when I ended up at Google was I had never worked on \na Web service before I joined Google in early 2003. And yet, somehow, over a fairly short \nperiod of time, I became responsible for the engineering associated with Google.com. So, you \nknow, it appears old dogs can occasionally learn new tricks, so -- (Laughter.) \nKEVIN SCOTT: I think you're being very modest. (Laughter.) But you -- you've done all this \nwork in distributed computing and like you had founded a network company. So, like you had \ntons of very relevant experience at how to build, like, high-scale systems. \nBILL COUGHRAN: Well, so what happened to me, so I started life at Bell Labs very much in \nthe research mold. So, success was writing papers and giving talks and what was a very \nacademic style, success metric. \nOver the years at Bell Labs, I felt like I was going to conferences and seeing the same subset of \n3- to 500 people over and over again. And I got a little bit frustrated with my ability to impact \nthings. \nAnd so, I guess somewhere along -- during my run at Bell Labs, I decided to get more \ncommercial. So, I took over as a general manager of a business that we started as well as the \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n5\ncomputing science research center, and I tried to start to think more about what's involved with \nactually building products and doing sales and so forth. And so, we decided to try to put a Bell \nLabs in Silicon Valley near Stanford. \nAnd so I came out to do that in late 1998 or 1999 and what I ran into I think is a little bit of what \nwe see today in the Valley, which was it was just a very frothy time. It was before the dot-com \nbubble burst and you know, people were funding stuff that probably didn't make a lot of sense, \nbut there was a lot of money chasing after ideas and eyeballs at that time. \nAnd I was trying to establish this sort of more traditional research lab. And after trying to do it \nfor a year and a half or so, I threw in the towel and went off with a colleague to found a small \nstartup in the area that was doing a telecommunications system project. And I was the CEO, he \nwas the CTO. And we built that company up from the two of us to about 140 people and then I -\n- we brought in a CEO to do the go-to-market side. \nI left and was going to start another company and then some old Bell Labs colleagues called me \nand said we needed adult supervision at Google, and that's kind of how I ended up at Google. \nKEVIN SCOTT: So, how did you get interested in technology in the first place? \nBILL COUGHRAN: So, I'm old enough that I think we call ourselves \"baby boomers\" now, \nbut at least when I was a kid, we were part of the -- what was then known as the \"Sputnik\" \ngeneration, which were people who -- you know, the U.S. was responding to the space race with \nthe then Soviet Union, and there was a lot of interest in science. And so, from a very early age, I \nwas interested in science and mathematics. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Were your parents engineers or technical folks? \nBILL COUGHRAN: No one in my family were technologists. It was just something I was \nattracted to and I was reasonably good at. And so, I went down that path. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Where did you -- I'm just sort of curious, where did you even find knowledge \nback then about how to program? Did you have mentors? Were there people helping you? \nWere you able to find books in libraries? \nBILL COUGHRAN: I mostly found books in libraries and then when I got access when I was \nin high school, I got access to the local university's 1620 machine. I got to speak and spend \nsome time with some of the people actually doing programming. And so, they acted as mentors \nto help me. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I'm, it's -- one of the things that I think is easy for all of us to take for \ngranted now is how not just sophisticated our programming systems are and how much power is \nat the disposal of your average programmer, but how much of the information about how to learn \nhow to do software development, how much of computer science is all out on the Internet \npublicly available. There are, like, all sorts of useful videos explaining it from sort of elementary \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n6\nlike super high-level, you know, sort of perspectives all the way down to, like, the deep nitty\u0002gritty research. \nBILL COUGHRAN: No, I agree. I think the other thing that's changed over the years is access \nto computing equipment. When I first got access with the first two or three machines, they were \nmachines that, you know, today would have cost the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of \ndollars. And they weren't machines that were in every elementary school, every high school, \nevery home. And so, there's just -- your exposure and availability to compute -- both learning \nmaterials, but also just the mechanical machinery, the actual computing devices is much easier. \nAlthough one thing I have noticed over the years, having been a leader in different groups over \nthe years, I think the knowledge of the actual computing devices has gotten weaker and weaker. \nAnd it's been interesting in the last few years as people have become interested in machine \nlearning and high-performance computing again, people are rediscovering all the nitty-gritties of \nlimited memory cache lines -- a lot of the very low-level stuff that I think the early developers, \nfor instance, the people who created Unix thought about how do you fit lots of capability into a \nvery small footprint? \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \nBILL COUGHRAN: Both memory-wise and computing-wise, and we've lost a lot of that. And\nwe're rediscovering it. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and like one of the things that I've always noticed is you know we \noperate on all of these high-level abstractions to do our jobs. And the engineers that I've found \nwho are sometimes able to do the most extraordinary things are ones who sort of disrespect -- or \nare able to disrespect the abstraction boundaries, where they can sort of say, okay, this is not \nworking, I don't understand what's going on, I'm not getting the performance I want out of this. \nLike, there's some weird bug and they just sort of punch through to lower and lower layers. \nSo one -- like, one of my theories about Jeff Dean, like, he was a compiler guy, right, by his PhD \nwork. And compiler folks they're very good at just getting this end-to-end view of computer \nsystems and like being able to wring extraordinary performance out of things even though, like, \nthey're not actually writing the optimizer bits of the compiler anymore. \nBILL COUGHRAN: No, I completely agree with that. Having worked with Jeff and his \ncolleague, Sanjay, they both I think were willing to go very deep into the technology and bypass \nlayers. And some of the people I've known for years, I've worked with before like Ken \nThompson were definitely of that ilk as well. \nI think one of the things that modern software suffers from is I think people sometimes do not \nspend enough time thinking about what the right abstractions are and how to make them very \nsimple. \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n7\nI think one of the things I've admired about Unix, which you can see in Linux today, is a lot of \nthe very low-level system calls that were introduced in Unix have stood the test of now multiple \ndecades because they were very thoughtful about what should be here and what shouldn't, and \nthey didn't add a lot of complexity or cross-functional capabilities. They were all pretty clear \ninterfaces. It's something a lot of modern software designers don't take the time and thought to \ndo it right. \nKEVIN SCOTT: And how much of that do you think were the individuals and their tastes and \nhow much of it was just the constraints they were operating under? I mean, like obviously, like a\nlot of people at the time were operating under the same constraints and not all of them invented \nUnix. But the constraints have to be useful, right? \nBILL COUGHRAN: The constraints are useful, but it is true that we live in a much more \ncomplicated world now. I think in the period where some of these early time-sharing systems \nwere built and a lot of the mini-computer work that then led to the personal computer work, you \nknow, people had glass teletypes, they were 24-by-80 character fixed-width kind of devices for \noutput, very simple input, and now everybody expects a lot of graphics, a lot of visuals. \nI think just the human-computer interface stuff that we do is much more complicated. You're \nright, I think the best systems designers know how to think about simplicity and scalability, but \nour world has continued to get more complicated, so --\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it's like one of the most interesting tensions I think we have in modern \nsoftware engineering. \nBILL COUGHRAN: Agree with that. \nKEVIN SCOTT: So, you get access to this machine at a local university, like you continue to \nget better and better programming. You go to college, you major in computer science? \nBILL COUGHRAN: Well, I think like many entering freshmen at Caltech, at least in those \ndays, I wanted to be a physicist. I think probably about 90 percent of the incoming class at that \ntime wanted to be physicists. \nKEVIN SCOTT: And was Feynman there at the time? \nBILL COUGHRAN: Feynman was there. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Okay, so that's a good motivator. \nBILL COUGHRAN: Yeah. And I had the opportunity to meet with him a few times in the \nyears I was there, an amazing person. Although, his books are much easier to read than it is to \ntake the exams associated with them. (Laughter.) But that's -- but I think like many of the \nentering freshmen, I discovered I wasn't smart enough to be a physicist. So, that got me into \nmath. \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n8\nMy first published paper in a refereed journal was actually when I was a freshman -- it was a \ncomputational chemistry paper that I did with a post-doc and one of the faculty members. And I \nhad the opportunity to do things like that during the four years I was there. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Do you remember what the paper was about?\nBILL COUGHRAN: (Laughter.) There's an approximation to a quantum chemistry problem \nthat's called a Hartree-Fock equations, and so this was a simulation on, at that time, a very large \nIBM 370 or 360-something-or-other that we ran overnight and calculated a bunch of ground \nstates of different small molecules. \nKEVIN SCOTT: That's super cool. \nBILL COUGHRAN: A long time ago. \nKEVIN SCOTT: No, but super cool. You know, and again, like, we'll get back to this later. \nYou already mentioned that you know like we have this sort of resurgence in like all of the \nthings that like people were interested in in high-performance computing back in the like '70s, \n'80s, and '90s with all of the like large-scale machine learning stuff that we're doing right now. \nBut you know, I think that the things that you were doing back then are probably like largely \ntransferrable to like things that people are doing now to train machine learning models.\nBILL COUGHRAN: Yeah, it's interesting. When I went to Stanford, my primary work as a \ngraduate student was in numerical modeling. My thesis was on numerical techniques for partial \ndifferential equations, fluid flow, and things like that. \nDid a lot of work with linear algebra and so forth. But it was all early high-performance \ncomputing work. And in those days, you know, there were controlled data machines around and \nCrays were starting \u2013 Cray-1 was starting to appear and so forth. And so, there was a lot of \ninterest in different ways to do abstractions in early high-performance computing work. \nAnd it's interesting. All that linear algebra, things that I got familiar with then have been \nrediscovered, of course, as part of the machine learning revolution that we're having today. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, it's really, really fascinating like as I spent a bunch of my time \ntrying to figure out like what the infrastructure needs to look like to support training very large\u0002scale models. I, in a very small way, had been doing work when I was in grad school in high\u0002performance computing. And it's just remarkable to me. \nLike, I thought, you know, funny enough when I took my job at Google in 2003 that all of the \nstuff that I'd done in graduate school was like gone forever and like I would never -- I'd never see \nthe day where it was useful again. And then I'm, you know, sitting here in 2019, and surprise, \nsurprise. Relevant. (Laughter.) \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n9\nBILL COUGHRAN: No, it's true. And, of course, high-performance computing developed \nhybrid machines, (inaudible) architectures, all kinds of things that are reappearing now in the \nmachine learning context, so --\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, well, you know, it's sort of interesting, right? And I'd love to get your \ntake on this. We're at this moment now where there are certain flavors of machine learning, so \nthis simulation-based reinforcement learning stuff that has achieved some fairly spectacular \nresults that have been publicly disclosed over the past few years, like mostly in game playing, \nand then there's like recent stuff and natural language processing on unsupervised learning. \nAnd in both of these cases, like the workloads are just because you have gotten human \nsupervision out of the direct training loop, like you don't have to produce a bunch of label \ntraining data, like you're sort of -- reinforcement learning, you're gathering all of your data to \ntrain the model inside of a simulation environment, and the unsupervised learning, like, you just \nhave like a large, like, Internet corpus of data that you're training on and you're trying to like \ninduce some structure out of it. \nSo, they're like absolutely insatiable in terms of their compute appetite. I mean, it's just mind \nboggling and like at least with the unsupervised models, and I think the same thing is true with \nthese reinforcement learning models, the more compute that you can throw at them, like the \nbetter the result you get. And so, like there's just this real tangible incentive to like throw them \nmore compute. \nAnd it's happening at exactly the same time where Moore's Law is running out of steam. And it's \nnot Moore's Law that's the problem, it's sort of the Dennard scaling that's the problem. Like, we \ncan put, you know, tens of billions of transistors on a die now, we just can't power them all. \nBILL COUGHRAN: Correct. \nKEVIN SCOTT: And so like you've -- like, we really are having to like revisit computer\narchitecture and, you know, like, how do you cool these things? How do you design their \nnetworks? Like, what is the memory hierarchy? I mean, it's just crazy that all of this is relevant \nagain. \nBILL COUGHRAN: No, I agree. And we're having, obviously, a revolution again in computer \narchitecture for all the reasons you point out. And you know, John Hennessy and Patterson just \nwon the Turing Award for basically having thought about computer architectures in different \nways, done RISC, written their book, and kind of I think they reopened the door as part of their \nTuring Award speech and some of the speeches they've given since, suggesting it's time to \nrethink computer architecture. So -- \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I completely agree with them. \nBILL COUGHRAN: The other thing that's been interesting with the insatiable appetite for \ncomputing, and it worries me a little bit, I still believe that universities are the best training \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n10\nground for people doing computer science work. You know, maybe not everybody should take \nthe time to go get a PhD, but I think having a rigorous program with lots of mathematics and \ntheory and so forth and not just -- it's more than just programming, but I think one of the \nchallenges with the rise this time of machine learning is I think the universities are at a \ndisadvantage. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes. \nBILL COUGHRAN: Because, you know, the big platform companies which of course would \ninclude Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Amazon, and others, are the best place to get your hands \non lots of data and lots of computing resources. I think it's very hard for MIT or Caltech or you \nknow Stanford to compete with those capabilities. \nAnd so, I think it does call into question what's the right partnership between universities and \nthese large companies? Because I think otherwise we're going to have a lot of people who are \ndeficient in their training as they enter the workforce and try to do novel things. \nKEVIN SCOTT: I completely agree. And it's become especially obvious I think over the past \nyear where some of this stuff on like the very frontier of AI, like the computations have become \nso large and it's so expensive that we even sort of have to think carefully about it inside of like \nthese big tech companies. Like, you just can't have 5,000 people all like doing each a $10-\nmillion computation to train their model. Like, you have to sort of think about like how you \nwant to focus these efforts in ways where you can, you know, where you can get leverage out of \nyour compute infrastructure. \nAnd I think it's especially hard for these universities. I've joined the advisory board of the \nStanford Human-Centered AI Institute. And thinking in general about like how we can form \nthese partnerships where we can make resources available. \nI think it's beyond just training, though. You also really need you know sort of dispassionate \nthird parties, you know pushing in interesting new directions. Like, one of the things I really \nworry about with the state that we're in in machine learning right now is that we have made a \nbunch of subjective decisions about how these computations should be performed by virtue of \nthe frameworks that we've built. \nAnd so like it's sort of like MapReduce, right, back in the day. So, as soon as you have \nMapReduce, it's like such a powerful abstraction mechanism that it solves like a ton of different \nproblems and like abstracts away like all of this tedium from you know like how to you know \nmassively you know in distribution fashion run these workloads. \nAnd, you know, the tool is simple enough and powerful enough where all of a sudden like \neverybody wants to try to bend their computation around where it's like a MapReduce job. And I \nthink we have a little bit of that right now. I mean, so like you look at these deep learning \nalgorithms, like, whether it's TensorFlow or PyTorch or like the numerical kernel of all of these \nthings is stochastic gradient descent. \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n11\nAnd, like, because you've chosen SGD as the way that you're going to like do the fitting for the\nmodels, it just sort of excludes a whole bunch of things that you might want to do. And so, like \nwe're -- in a real sense, we have been pushing people down to this like what has to be a local --\nlike a local optima. And you know, I would love to have like just a much, much larger pool of \npeople sort of pushing at those assumptions. But in order to do it and to compete to show that \nthe new thing is as effective as the, you know, the old thing, like, they have to have the compute \nresources. \nBILL COUGHRAN: Oh, I agree. And I think the other thing which, of course, has happened \nmore and more with machine learning is not only are we constrained by the frameworks, but \nwe're also I think even in the unlabeled case, the case where you're not pre-labeling data and \nyou're doing unsupervised learning, I think you have the risk that if you feed it the wrong sets of \ndata, you can generate biases of various kinds without even realizing it. And it's tricky. There \nhave been a number of published results on this stuff, but it's kind of insidious. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So, let's go back. So, tell me a little bit more about this experience\nwith starting a company because that is a very unique thing. It is not at all like managing \nresearchers, it's not like -- you know, even though Google hadn't gone public when you got there, \nlike it was already a reasonably big thing. \nBILL COUGHRAN: Yeah, it was 4- or 500 people. \nKEVIN SCOTT: But like zero to 140 is like -- I mean, that is a -- that's something else. \nBILL COUGHRAN: Well, you learn to tell stories to venture capitalists. So, now that I'm\ndoing that as a full-time job, you get to play the other side of that drama. But you have to think \nabout what's the product you want to build? What kind of team do you need? How much \nfunding do you need? You have to think about everything. And starting as you say from zero, \nyou've got the challenge of, you know, you're the janitor when day one starts, right? \nAnd so, you have to think about everything -- you'll laugh. I did the payroll and the bookkeeping \nfor the first few, I think, first few months, not that I'm particularly good at that, but I can do a \nlittle bit of accounting math. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, and it must have been good preparation for what you ultimately had to \ndo at Google because at some point you weren't just an engineering director of like a group of \npeople, you were sort of like the CEO of like an army of engineering people. And so, like you \nhad HR issues, you had finance things, you had facilities things. I mean, like I remember \nwalking into your office at one point, you know, where you were, you know, sort of looking \nparticularly exhausted. \nAnd I was, like, you know, what's going on? And like you had this spreadsheet in front of you \nlike where you were thing to like figure out where everybody was going to sit who was being \nhired in the next unit of time, which is probably very far away from writing papers about, you \nknow, ground state simulations of quantum chemistry systems. (Laughter.) \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n12\nBILL COUGHRAN: No, it's true. I, well, so I think the role I fell into at Google was I was \nwilling to take on stuff that not everybody else was willing to take on. So, there was a small \nexecutive committee that ran Google, of which I was a part for a few years -- number of years. \nAnd I -- for a while, worried about things like facilities and HR. And you have to do this in a \nyoung company. You have to do what you need to do to make it successful. \nAnd part of the challenge and you saw this at Google, I'm sure you also saw it in your experience \nat LinkedIn, it sounds very hard to go from zero to 140, it's also very hard to go from a few \nhundred to several thousand. The scaling, trying to figure out what works. You want to \nintroduce more process and structure, but if you introduce too much, it kind of kills all the \nenergy and excitement in the team and so forth. And so finding a path through a heavy growth \nphase of a company is pretty tricky. And I did a lot of that for Google in the early years. \nKEVIN SCOTT: What do you think was the most challenging thing that you -- or problem that \nyou had to solve in those early years? \nBILL COUGHRAN: I didn't join Google until early 2003, but I think from when the dot-com \nbubble burst to probably 2004 or '05, recruiting was hard, but it wasn't crazy like it is today \nbecause there weren't enough kind of growing, powerful new companies forming because of the \nsort of downdraft that happened because of the dot-com burst. \nI think today, one of the challenges I see with the young companies I work with is just figuring \nout where to recruit and what to do. One of the things you see from more and more companies is \nlooking at doing engineering away from Silicon Valley. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \nBILL COUGHRAN: And then I think one of the biggest challenges I saw in the early days at \nGoogle was it was still very much a startup, even though when I joined it had a few hundred \nemployees. And there were key areas inside the Search product, for example, where only one or \ntwo people actually knew some of the key things to get things done. \nAnd so one of the challenges that I found particularly hard was figuring out a way to not \ndisempower and take responsibility away from the people who had been standing in the breach, \nso to speak, but building a team around them so that you could actually have turnover and have \norganizational stability, but you sort of transition from a few kind of superhero type people that \nknow all these key things to teams that actually own things. \nAnd that's an enormous cultural change, which we went through. I think we managed to \npreserve a lot of what was good about the original culture, but it was hard. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, another, I mean, just sort of outside looking in, like one of the things \nthat you always seem to have a real talent for was managing the very senior, like, very most \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n13\ncapable engineers and like figuring out how to you know let -- give them the space to do their \nbest work without like sort of having the crush of like all of the sort of outside world and you \nknow sort of friction that can sort of land on you as an engineer. \nI mean, like, at one point, you had like almost all of or maybe all of the principal distinguished \nengineers and fellows reporting into you. And like they're not an easy group of folks to manage. \nI mean, I know many of them, I love them. Like, they're like fantastic human beings. But \nthey're smart, they're -- they have strong opinions, they're you know sometimes their interactions \nyou know with one another or like with other engineers are sort of like interesting. \nBut somehow or another, like, you built this environment where all of these folks could like \nreally flourish because at some point, like, they just don't -- they don't have to work for you, they \ndon't have to work at Google, they can do anything that they want to do. \nBILL COUGHRAN: So, I think what I tried to do, and I think I was successful more often than \nI wasn't, was find areas that were important to the company that different individuals were \ninterested in. That's how we -- you know, we spawned a project called Borg internally to do \ncluster management. There were a group of people -- if you look at the work that was done \nthere, it was very good, it was very deep, it was ahead of its time. \nBut it also was rediscovering mainframe timesharing, but on a cluster. And so some of it was \nrecycling ideas that were prevalent in the '60s and in the early '70s, but finding the right set of \npeople that were interested in that problem, were motivated by the problem, and putting them \ntogether. So, finding things that were interesting, you know, we had the challenge of managing \nlocking and global namespace stuff, and that was an area that Mike Burrows was particularly \nattracted to and did a terrific job with. And I think so it was just picking individuals. But it didn't \nalways work. \nKEVIN SCOTT: That particular one is sort of genius like sort of saying like here's this person \nwho can work on these problems and like we're going to go build infrastructure that everybody \nelse can use. I mean, those are some of the hardest problems in software engineering. Like, \nproving that you know, Paxos is implemented correctly in like one of these locking systems. \nAnd like Mike is, you know, maybe the best person in the world, like, one of the best persons in \nthe world. \nBILL COUGHRAN: No, I agree. And Google had -- and still has people that are absolutely \nworld class and strong. But you're right, some of them don't mix well together. You have to \nfigure out the right problems, and it didn't always work. \nThe other thing I often tell young companies that I work with now is Google also could cheat. \nAnd I don't mean that in a nefarious way, with the advent of AdWords, it started to become you \nknow lots of positive cash flow--it gave flexibility -- the fact that the business was so strong gave \nus access to resources and capabilities we wouldn't have had. And one of the things I always \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n14\nfind amusing is when I am working with a very young company and they want to talk about \ncreating 20-percent time. \nAnd I often will tell them when you have a massively profitable business, why don't you come \nback and ask me about 20-percent time. So, I think people need to be more realistic about what \nconstraints you're operating under. \nAnd at Google, one of the things I did is like we started storage projects we weren't absolutely \nsure we would need because we had the flexibility and at another company you wouldn't do that. \nMost of those bets turned out to be good bets, but not all of them. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, well, you know, it's sort of interesting, like even 20-percent time, like \nthere are things like that that take on these mythological proportions. And, like, I don't ever \nremember using 20-percent time. And it wasn't because I didn't think it was available, it wasn't \nbecause my manager wouldn't have supported it, it was because I was so interested in the work \nthat was my 100-percent time that I didn't want to stop doing that to go do this other thing. I \nmean, it was nice to know that I had it if I wanted to use it, but I think a whole lot of people like \n\u2013\nBILL COUGHRAN: Most people did not use it. Yeah. And not everybody had an exciting \nnew project they wanted to start on their own, so --\nKEVIN SCOTT: The thing that I really enjoyed out of Google as it was growing as fast as it \nwas, so I was there like I joined I guess a few months after you did in 2003 and then I left the \nfirst time in the middle of 2007. \nAnd, you know, the thing that was just extraordinary for me over that period of time is like \nbecause we were growing so fast and we were solving so many problems for ourselves the first \ntime, you got to be this sort of participant in the unfolding of like this really interesting great \nbusiness and this really interesting great technology stack. And you sort of got to see, okay, this \nworked, this didn't work. \nAnd like in a very quick period of time, like I felt like I got exposed to like a whole bunch of \nthings that I never would have been able to get exposure to if I had been at some place that \nwasn't growing that fast. \nBILL COUGHRAN: Oh, I think that's right. I agree. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, when I left to go do AdMob, which was already a company I joined in \n2007 to run the engineering team when it was like -- the whole company was about 25 people I \nthink. \nAnd like I felt just because I'd been able to raise my hand and say, oh, yeah, like I'll go help with \nthe mentorship program. I'll go help set up a faculty summit. I will go like you need someone to \ngo due diligence on like an M&A thing that we're doing. Like, none of which I was qualified to \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n15\ndo when I raised my hand, but because no one else was there who was raising their hand to do it, \nlike I got all of this experience. \nAnd when I went to AdMob, it was like, okay, like, I'm like there's still a whole bunch of stuff I \nneed to learn, but at least I'm confident in like a big enough set of things where I can, you know, \nI can have some modicum of comfort that I'm not going to screw everything up. (Laughter.) \nBILL COUGHRAN: Yeah, you can learn a lot. And you get a lot of advancement and \nopportunities to do different things, right? It's a special time in many companies, so \u2013\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, you were at Google for how long? You left in 2011? So you were there \nfor --\nBILL COUGHRAN: Eight and a half years I think, yeah. \nKEVIN SCOTT: And so how -- what was the biggest team that you had? So, you were up to \n5-, 6,000 people? \nBILL COUGHRAN: Yeah, it was probably a little bit north of 6,000. Google broke itself up \ninto product divisions, they call product areas. And I think at one point, I had amassed what are \ntoday four or five of their product areas. \nKEVIN SCOTT: So, let's talk about the transition to venture capital. So, you've been doing this \nfor I guess almost eight years now. \nBILL COUGHRAN: Close to eight years. \nKEVIN SCOTT: And so like what made you could have done anything. You could have \nstayed at Google, you could have like gone to another company and done a similar thing, you \ncould have started a company. You could have retired. You could have basically done \nwhatever. \nBILL COUGHRAN: Yeah, I think when I look back at my career, so I thought -- one of the \nchallenges of the role that I had at Google is I was unsure what I could do at another company \nthat wouldn't feel like a step down. And it's not that I'm in love with a particular title or a \nparticular role, but there aren't a lot of Googles in the growth phase out there. I think there are \nprobably a small number, but they're very few and far between. \nAnd so, I didn't see how to repeat that. And I think one of the things I've gotten better at over the \nlast ten or 15 years is mentoring and spending time with people and helping them think through \ntheir problems and their challenges and so forth. \nAnd it felt like I could do that as a board member, as a mentor to a bunch of young companies. \nAnd so for me, some of it's what people I think call \"giving back,\" but some of it is I think at this \nstage of my career I'm probably better as a coach than as a player. \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n16\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, well, I mean, I remember some of the best advice that I've ever \nreceived has been from you. And I remember like just vividly this one like sort of critical \nmoment in my own career. So, this is when I was thinking about leaving Google to go to \nAdMob, I'd chatted with a few companies, like I had chatted with Omar, who's I guess now one \nof your partners at Sequoia, who was like the founder and CEO of AdMob. \nAnd I remember I asked you for a meeting, which you were always generous enough to take \nwhen you were much, much busier than I was. And I remember coming into the room and I was \nlike very reluctantly admitting that it's like, oh, I've been out talking to these companies and like \nI'm thinking about leaving and you already knew because somebody had -- whose name I will \nnot name had -- (laughter) \nBILL COUGHRAN: Yes, I think I know who, yes. \nKEVIN SCOTT: And, you know, like done a background check, I'm guessing. But you gave\nme the best advice. You were like, okay, like, here's the advice I'm going to give you with my \nGoogle hat on, which is you know, whatever that was. \nAnd then here's, you know, the advice I'm going to give you without the Google hat on, which \nwas like just super helpful to have both of those perspectives in making that decision, which was \nreally hard. Like I had a hard time leaving because it was really -- it was a great company and I \nhad so many friends there and I felt so grateful for the opportunity that I had gotten, which I \nthink a lot of it was luck. There's no way that --\nBILL COUGHRAN: There's a lot of luck in many outcomes in life, I've decided. (Laughter.) \nKEVIN SCOTT: There's a lot of luck. Just extraordinary amounts of it. But, you know, like \nthat advice you gave me was like one of the -- and it was certainly like a pivotal moment, like the \nwhole -- my experience with AdMob, like without that, I wouldn't have been able to you know \nget the role that I had at LinkedIn. Without the role at LinkedIn, I wouldn't be sitting here as \nCTO of Microsoft. And so, you know, like in -- so, you know, I'm glad that you're out there like \ngiving other people this like really good advice. \nSo like, what made you decide that like this is the sort of thing that's worth your time? Because \nyou were doing it even before it was like officially your job as a like a venture capitalist. You \ndidn't have to take that meeting that day or like any of the other times, you know, because I was \nway below you in the org. And you weren't just doing it for me, you were doing it for a bunch of \nother people. \nBILL COUGHRAN: So, maybe this is one of the things I've tried to do as a leader, I think \nmost people -- you know, when you're employed by a company, you're employed by Google,\nnow I'm employed by Sequoia Capital, you have to have loyalty to your employer, but I also \nthink as a leader inside of any organization, you also have to be authentic. And you have to -- if \nsomebody asks you for advice, they don't want the company line. They want real advice. \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n17\nAnd so what I've always done in the last many years is do exactly what you described, which is I \nwill give you my advice as a leader inside a company, but then I will also give you my advice as \nan individual. And I think, to me, that's been one of the things that I think has bonded people to \nme over the years, because they feel like they're not getting a bunch of political mumbo-jumbo, \nwhich unfortunately I think particularly folks in large corporations, I've known a number, they \ncan only talk in the sort of party line mode and they never get out of it. \nAnd it makes them appear, even if it's not true, as phony. And so I think part of it's just being \ngenuine and authentic when you talk to people. \nKEVIN SCOTT: It's sort of scary to do because when I was running engineering and \noperations and LinkedIn, which grew over the course of the six years that I was doing the job \nfrom a couple hundred people to about 3,000. Like I took this queue from you that I was going to \ntry to be as authentic as possible when someone came to me and like they were struggling with a \nproblem and like trying to figure out like what the next step was for them. \nAnd like I would do almost exactly the same thing that you did for me. Like if they were \ncontemplating a job offer, it's like here are all the many reasons why I would like you to stay like \nbecause we really need you here and, you know, like we walk through the whole thing. \nAnd then I would give them, you know, my unsolicited advice, and sometimes it would be like, \nhey, I don't think that this is like based on what I know about you and what you've told me about \nyour aspirations, like I don't think that this is a good move for you. And sometimes I would tell \npeople, it's like this isn't a bad option. Like, you are now faced with a tough choice, like I think \nit's a -- you know, you've got a good option here and you've got a good option there. \nAnd the thing that I found, though, like even it's a horrifying thing like when you are leading you \nknow a group of people and like you and in a very sort of very concrete way are dependent on \nthem to like be able to achieve all of the things that, you know, you're trying to get your \ncompany to achieve. \nBut I found like having those conversations like I think because people believe that I had a \ngenuine interest in like their success and their happiness, like I wound up being able to hold onto \na bunch of people like way longer than I would have otherwise. \nBILL COUGHRAN: I think that's right. \nKEVIN SCOTT: But it was hard to do because it feels very scary. \nBILL COUGHRAN: Yeah, it's risky. It feels risky. I understand. I think the other thing \nwhich I saw at Google and I suspect you've seen in your arc, too, is Google hired a lot of very \nbright kind of new grads or it was their first or second job, and it was fairly common for people \nafter a few years to kind of wonder what the world looked like outside of the particular confines \nof Mountain View at the time. And that's not irrational for a young person. \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n18\nKEVIN SCOTT: No. \nBILL COUGHRAN: And on the other hand, Google wanted to retain those people. And there \nwere some difficult challenges in that. \nKEVIN SCOTT: So, what's -- what are the most interesting things that you're seeing in \nventure now? So, like, it's -- it is an exciting time right now because like, there's a lot of venture \ncapital out there. It's never been easier to start a technology company because you have open \nsource, you have all this cloud infrastructure, you have like an increasingly powerful set of \ncapabilities that let small teams accomplish big things. \nAnd like you're at Sequoia, which is like one of the top venture capital firms in the world. So, \nlike, what's interesting right now? \nBILL COUGHRAN: Well, there's clearly a lot of interest in software around machine learning. \nI think that there's a bunch of companies trying to create tooling or do vertical applications. \nI think there aren't very many companies proposing to do platforms because you've got \nTensorFlow, PyTorch, and other things in the market from companies that have, obviously, \nmuch larger resources than you can mount from a startup. \nBut the sort of machine learning software and getting machine learning that's usable and\ndigestible by a broad community is very hard to do. And I think there are some interesting ideas \nand companies around that. \nThere's a lot of interest in processor technology both for machine learning, but also I'm starting \nto see some companies that are talking about rethinking more server processors more generally \nand so forth. And so, I think there's a lot of that. \nThose are harder companies I think for venture capital just because it requires hundreds and \nmillions of dollars of investment rather than you know tens of millions of dollars of investment. \nSo, I think -- but I see interest in that area. \nThere's a lot of interest in quantum computing, which is -- you know, people will debate whether \nit's about to go commercial or whether it's still going to be research for a few more years. It feels \nto me like we're on the cusp of a bunch of things right now in that area. Those are very \ninteresting. \nAnd then there are interesting companies in storage and networking and so forth, but I think the \nbig things have been processors, machine learning, and then quantum are areas that I think are \nparticularly interesting. \nKEVIN SCOTT: And the processor trend, aside from the machine learning stuff, so like we're \nseeing with distributed systems, right now that like architecturally, like one way to compose \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n19\nthese things now is streams and stream processors, which are going to have different compute \nrequirements than normal sorts of processors. \nThere's also like this interesting thing where you sort of reach your sort of power saturation point \nwith transistors for logic, but you haven't yet for memory cells.\nBILL COUGHRAN: Yeah, I think there's tradeoffs now that people are rethinking about --\nbetween you know actual logic-type processing versus memory, what kind of embedded memory \ndo you want, what kind of memory structures, you know, there's obviously new kinds of memory\ncoming into the market that don't require DRAM refreshes, but are faster, that's another area that \nmay be interesting. \nI think the other thing which strikes me as a big challenge as people think about processors \nthemselves is you know, there's been some fascinating work on the security side and very scary, \npeople did not think through all the risks with speculative execution. And on the other hand, if \nyou throw speculative execution out, you hurt performance a lot. \nAnd so I think there are people trying to think about how do you think more from first principles \nabout what the security risks are in processor design so that -- because when you admit security \nweaknesses at the very bottom layer of the hardware, it's pretty hard to defend against. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \nBILL COUGHRAN: And it's scary in new ways, right? And so, I think there are a lot of\ninteresting things happening in and around that area. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Are you seeing the stuff with the -- in the IoT space? Because \nprocessors there like still have a couple of generations of, you know, real Moore's Law left in \nthem. \nBILL COUGHRAN: So, we're seeing a bunch of companies around -- there are a lot of people \nlooking at processors for the edge where they can do some inference, maybe a little bit of \ntraining I think, and very low-cost kind of microcontroller-level designs and so forth. \nThere's a number of interesting new ideas and companies in that area. I'm -- when I've looked at \nIoT, I've mostly looked at things related to industrial IoT because I think consumer IoT has been \ntricky for a variety of reasons. One is, it's often driven by brand and consumer reach, which I \nthink advantages companies like Apple and others. And I think the other thing is smart phones \nare too good at doing a lot of different things, and so the killer apps for the consumer IoT I think \nhas been pretty limited so far. Personal opinion, but there you go. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, we can certainly see that the industrial IoT stuff, like the \napplications there are like rich and like there's an enormous amount of opportunity there. I think \nwe sort of see the world in similar ways. \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n20\nBILL COUGHRAN: Yeah, no it's -- consumer IoT I think more and more devices are \nconnected and have some ability to respond to command and so forth. And we'll see a \nproliferation of that, but special use cases I think are -- there aren't enough interesting use cases. \nI talked to people that have Alexa devices or you know the Google Home devices and so forth \nand they use them to set alarms and timers and play certain kinds of music and so forth, and then \nthey rapidly seem to run out of other things do with them. \nKEVIN SCOTT: The thing that I think is a little bit interesting, though, is that the capability in \nthese devices already like in both the hardware and the software is much higher than what we're \nusing it for. \nBILL COUGHRAN: Absolutely. (Laughter.) \nKEVIN SCOTT: So, you know, like just as a proof of concept thing, I'm building an AI coffee \nmachine right now, which probably sounds weirder than it actually is. But like the idea is, can \nyou build a consumer appliance from scratch, like as an individual, although like you know, one \nwith slightly more resources than an average individual. \nBut, like, can you build a device that has like a modern AI-powered user experience in it? And \nso, like this thing will have no buttons, no displays. And it will have a camera, a speaker, and a \nmicrophone. And so like when you walk up to it and like it knows that you're paying attention to \nit using very straightforward computer vision models, it will say to you, \"Can I make you a cup \nof coffee?\" And it will be able to recognize who you are and remember your preferences and --\nBILL COUGHRAN: Yeah, no, that's true. \nKEVIN SCOTT: And, like, that's an entirely -- you know, entirely doable mode of like \nbuilding a user interface on a consumer device right now and it's going to be not too terribly \nexpensive in the not-too-distant future. Like, I'm going to be able to do this with 30 bucks' worth \nof electronics and like the price of that's going down to two over the next few years, I would \nimagine. \nBILL COUGHRAN: I think you'll see that in a lot of consumer devices, but they'll be very \nlimited and narrow use cases. So --\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I just -- I'm just super excited about (laughter) about what's possible \nthere, so I want to get people inspired to do more. \nBILL COUGHRAN: I think human interfaces that are voice driven and have some aspect of \ncomputer vision is clearly where things are going. So --\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, awesome. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us \ntoday, Bill. It's been a pleasure. \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n21\nBILL COUGHRAN: It's been my pleasure to be here. Thank you for again for the invitation. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome. \nCHRISTINA WARREN: Well, we hope you enjoyed Kevin's interview with Bill Coughran. \nSo, Kevin, one of the really interesting things that you and Bill were talking about is what was \nold is kind of new again, and kind of how the tech that was -- the problems that we were trying to \nsolve in the '70s and '80s and even the '90s are now kind of coming back in vogue again. Why do \nyou think that it is that those problems are so relevant and that we're still going back and kind of \nrevisiting some of those ideas?\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it's amazing to me how cyclical technology is as a business. Like I've \nbeen coding since I'm 12, I'm 47 now, so, you know, 35 years-ish of like paying very close \nattention to what's happening in computing.\nAnd like just inside of like the 35 years like there have been multiple cycles where you'll like\nhave this intense enthusiasm for a thing and then it will sort of fall a bit out of fashion, and then \nthe next thing comes in and you'll sort of forget temporarily all about the old stuff.\nYou know, I think these older technologies that pop back up, it's almost a puzzle why they went \nout of fashion in the first place. You know, it's like you look high performance computing for \ninstance, we were building in the '70s, '80s, and '90s like these very sort of idiosyncratic \nsupercomputers and very high performance machines that all were different in little ways.\nSo, like they had a good idea about how do the memory hierarchy or a good idea about how to \ndo networking or a good idea about how to split the computation up across a bunch of different \nprocessors.\nAnd the thing that caused them to go out of fashion is like there was this sort of catalyst, you \nknow, driven by the rapid growth of the Internet to sort of standardize your compute \narchitectures on commodity CPUs, commodity memory, commodity networks, like commodity \neverything. And so, like you just sort of created at massive scale like large, large amounts of \ncompute where all of the like individual units of compute looked exactly the same and were built \nas cheaply as possible.\nAnd like that works really well for, you know, sort of the problems that we had for the first 20 \nyears or so of like the commercial explosion of the Internet.\nWhat we're seeing right now is like the problems are different again, but like different in the \nsame way that they were like a bunch of years ago. And so, like now we are -- we're digging \nback up all of that good work that folks did a few decades ago and are realizing like how \nvaluable it still is in these new contexts.\nIt's really fun, because I spent a bunch of the early parts of my career thinking about these things. \nLike I did an internship at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications like where we \nBehind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast\nEP-12: Bill Coughran: Human-Centered AI\n22\nlike when I was there we had just taken delivery of this machine called the CM5 from a company \ncalled Thinking Machines, founded by, you know, a famous computer scientist, Danny Hillis, \nwho like I hope we will get to come on this show at some point. Like Danny is like a super \nawesome human being and like just like maybe the most brilliant mad scientist I've ever met. I \nlove Danny.\nBut anyway, you know, this machine was just epically big and like epically cool and just sort of \nlike it was -- it was a challenge to program this thing, but like when you could harness all of its\npower, it could do miraculous things.\nAnd, you know, I never in my life would have thought that all of this stuff that I did back in the\n'90s was going to be relevant again one day. So, it's like really I'm sort of glad that technology \nhas these cycles, because it's almost like I get to do two things at once, sort of be nostalgic about \nlike all of this cool old stuff and like I get a set of techniques to solve a set of problems that are \nvery relevant today.\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I love it. No, it's so cool to be able to revisit the past but also use the \nadvantages that we have now in solving those problems. That's great.\nKEVIN SCOTT: And the cycles are -- like can be really long. Like the other thing, too, like I \nthink is worth thinking about AI right now and some of the disruptive effects that it could \npotentially have, like we're learning lessons even from the Industrial Revolution, which is like \nnot just a couple of decades ago, it's like centuries ago.\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, that's so true, I hadn't even thought about, but you're right, I \nmean, these cycles can be really long and we can learn lessons from them -- or hopefully we can, \nright?\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So, the message for the young ones is like pay attention to history, \nvery, very important.\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Okay, so we need to wrap up, but before we do, remember to tell \nyour friends, your colleagues, your neighbors, your barista, your Lyft driver, your dental \nhygienist -- real talk, I actually have told my dental hygienist and my dentist, I have.\nOkay, you know, you get it, tell everybody you know about the show and you can write to us \nanytime at BehindTheTech@microsoft.com, to give us your feedback and tell us what you'd like \nto hear more of.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, we really would like to hear from you. See you next time.\n[MUSIC]"}
