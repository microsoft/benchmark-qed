{"episode": "EP-65 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Ethan Mollick", "text": "ETHAN MOLLICK: Like, when I talk to companies, I always tell them two things. One thing is that something you used to do that was valuable is no longer valuable. And the sooner you realize that, the better off you are, right? And the second thing is, there\u2019s something impossible you always wanted to do that you can do. What is the impossible thing?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer and EVP of AI at Microsoft.  \nToday, tech is part of nearly every aspect of our lives. We\u2019re in the early days of an AI revolution promising to transform our lived experiences as much as any technology ever has. On this podcast, we\u2019ll talk with the folks behind that technology and explore the motivations, passion, and curiosity driving them to create the tech shaping our world. Let\u2019s get started.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m co-host Christina Warren, senior developer advocate at GitHub.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And we have a fascinating interview today with Ethan Mollick, who is a professor at the Wharton School and who\u2019s at the forefront of studying AI and especially its impact on work and education. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think Ethan is an incredibly energetic person, you know, just sort of thinking about how these new tools can be used to solve interesting problems. And you know, he has accumulated quite a following on social media, as well as the excellent work that he was doing in academic circles, just talking not just rigorously about how AI has all of these incredible potential benefits, but, you know, just really engaging on like, hey, like, I\u2019m trying this, like, you know, you all should have a look and just giving people that provocation to be a little bit more ambitious with how they\u2019re thinking about the tools. So like, he \u2013 he\u2019s, you know, one of, in my opinions, the most interesting voices out there right now talking about AI.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I totally agree, and I\u2019m really, really looking forward to hearing this conversation. \n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Ethan Mollick is an associate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He teaches innovation and entrepreneurship, and his research examines AI\u2019s impact on work and education, among other things. His papers have been published and cited in top journals, and his book on AI, Co-Intelligence, is a New York Times bestseller. \n\nEthan writes a newsletter on Substack called One Useful Thing, where he shares his understanding of the implications of AI for work, education and life, with almost 150,000 subscribers. \n\nEthan also leads Wharton\u2019s Interactive, an effort to democratize education through using games, simulations and AI. \n\nPrior to his time in academia, Ethan co-founded a startup company, and he advises numerous organizations. \n\nEthan received his PhD and MBA from MIT Sloan School of Management and his bachelor\u2019s degree from Harvard University. \n\nEthan, we\u2019re so happy to have you on the podcast today. Thanks for being here.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: I\u2019m thrilled to be here. Thanks for having me.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So the way these conversations on my podcast always go is we sort of start at the very beginning. You know, how did you get interested in technology in the first place? And like, what was your childhood like, presuming that, you know, the interest in tech started that early?\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: I know this is going to turn out to be a complete shock to you, but I have been a long time nerd of the old school category, right? So I had my MS-DOS machines, and I had, you know, we were, you know, trading games among ourselves. I ran a bulletin board for a little while back in the 80s, and then have been sort of tech adjacent ever since. But, you know, video games and in the form they existed in the \u201880s, programing stuff. I\u2019m not actually a coder, but I\u2019ve been coder adjacent my entire life, so. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nETHAN MOLLICK: That \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 so definitely the background.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so it is an interesting thing. So you know, you and I are probably, like I presume I\u2019m older than you, but, you know, we were sort of coming up during that ascent of personal computing into basically just ubiquity in the public. So we basically went from, you know, computers were things that sat in rooms, were horrendously expensive, you know, capital intensive devices and only, you know, like very strange people with a very high degree of focus used them, to like, everyone had one, and like, the transition happened really quickly. \n\nSo, you know, and I want to talk about the parallels from then and now a little bit later. But what \u2013 what was it, you know, in your family that even gave you the exposure? Because, you know, running BBSs and doing all of this stuff was still, you know, back in the \u201880s, that \u2013 that was a pretty advanced technical set of things to be doing.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: So, I mean, part of this was I still remember when my we had a neighborhood computer club. So everyone got together and bought Apple IIEs, and then we shared software because it was expensive. So you\u2019d get a disk and you could borrow Print Shop or whatever. \n\nSo there was \u2013 it kind of gave me a built-in community, right? So this is before the days of the internet, but all the other kids in my neighborhood, where we were all trading the same disks back and forth and doing that. \n\nSo there was this kind of like, built-in community piece among nerdy kids, right, which is suddenly all the weird nerd hobbies you have, like unlock your ability to play video games and do all this kind of other fun stuff. \n\nSo it was \u2013 I grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, like not a coastal person at all, even though I sound like a New Yorker. But you know, it was interesting because it was just something that was local. And you\u2019d buy your \u2013 you know, your computer magazines, and it felt like there was a community among fellow high school and, you know, middle school students that kind of drove it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And \u2013 so you had all of these nerd interests, and what did you choose to do? Like what was sort of, you know, your path, like what you were super interested in, in high school? Like, you know, you went to college. Like, what did you choose to major in and why?\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: So I made up my own majors in undergrad in science technology policy. So the thing about \u2013 the horrible secret about me is people think I\u2019m really, really good at sort of the math and science. I got a PhD from MIT. I am actually \u2013 you know, but I\u2019m not actually a natural math person, right? What I am pretty good at is understanding systems and how they relate together. And I\u2019m very, you know, understand science deeply, but I\u2019m not the kind of cutting-edge math person out there, right? \n\nSo I\u2019ve always been very interested in what does science mean and how to use it and understanding deeply how it works. And so, I made up a major in science and technology policy, history of science. I wrote \u2013 my original paper I ever wrote was \u2013 my undergraduate thesis was on Moore\u2019s Law and interviewed Gordon Moore to try and figure out \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s awesome.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: \u2013 actually my first academic paper that was ever published was sort of why this happened the way it was, and that\u2019s sort of \u2013 and a lot of \u2013 I did work with the Media Lab at MIT at the same time. So very interesting kind of what it all means, rather than trying to think about coding myself.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, well, I mean, maybe we can just sort of jump right into what it all means because some of the things, you know, that we\u2019ve already talked about, like this, the PC revolution, like this point in time where a brand new technology went from inaccessible and unusable to like, highly usable and ubiquitous seems like it\u2019s playing out again right now. \n\nAnd like, one of the things that drove that earlier round of innovation is Moore\u2019s Law, the \u2013 the fact that the compute got cheap so quickly that, you know, you could do increasingly interesting things with computers and, you know, even, you know, go through the process of making them more useful, like you could burn part of the CPUs resources on things like user interface. \n\nAnd it\u2019s sort of the same thing right now. Like, we\u2019ve got AI. Like, it\u2019s very \u2013 you know, it\u2019s made the phase shift from, you know, really challenging technology to go leverage to very easy technology to leverage, and it\u2019s being largely driven by compute. So, you know, like I love your take on what the parallels are.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: There\u2019s a second dimension besides compute. I mean, compute is the underlying driver of almost everything, right? Like, you look behind \u2013 you know, you have the Scooby-Doo mask of almost anything, and it\u2019s Moore\u2019s Law behind it, right, which is like, that\u2019s the driving force of the last century. And so, you know \u2013 or three-quarters of a century at this point. And, you know, always an interesting topic about how that kind of existed. \n\nBut the interesting thing that also drives this is the kind of unexpected fact that LLMs especially turn out to be a very human technology. It turns out by training them on human stuff, they just work in a very human way. \n\nAnd that means that people who can\u2019t code, like, we\u2019re back to that kind of interesting world where you don\u2019t have to know magical coding secrets. If you\u2019re a good manager of people, you\u2019re probably going to be good with LLMs. \n\nSo there\u2019s kind of this leapfrog effect also, which is most of the technologies start with, like how do you hack the command line, and then it takes a long time to get to the point where it\u2019s like, okay, there\u2019s a GUI and you don\u2019t even have to know what a file system is anymore. \n\nThat\u2019s not happening with LLMs, right? The interesting skip is the most useful way to do this, you know, there\u2019s some early evidence that coders are actually the worst people to use AI because it doesn\u2019t do loops. It doesn\u2019t do any of the things you would expect it to do in code. \n\nAI, you know, your computer system shouldn\u2019t be probabilistic. It shouldn\u2019t argue with you and try and diagnose your psychological issues. AI does those things when you interact with it. \n\nSo I think part of what makes the skip interesting is not just its accessibility, but the fact that it\u2019s a kind of a new modality by accident of working with machines.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it\u2019s sort of interesting that you point that out. It\u2019s a thing I\u2019ve been saying for a handful of years now. We \u2013 for the first two centuries, really of programing, basically the only way that you could get a computing device to do your bidding was either become an expert programmer, which was this very complicated task of, you know, learning the intricacies of the machine and then learning all of the ways in which you can map human understanding of problems onto things that the machine can actually go execute. Or you have to rely on a programmer to have anticipated your needs and built a program that you can then go run on one of these computing devices. And like, that\u2019s sort of the way it was since, you know, Ada Lovelace wrote the first program. \n\nAnd like, that has very dramatically changed in the past handful of years. You can now get machines to do very, very complicated things for you where you are not constrained by having to be a very skilled programmer, which is not to say skilled programing is like a thing that\u2019s going away. Like, maybe we need even more of them than we ever did, but it like really opens the aperture up on who gets to decide what computing devices go do.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: And I think that \u2013 and by the way, I think that one of the most interesting things is actually the role Microsoft is playing with Copilot and its wide availability around the world. \n\nYou know, when I talk to organizations, I\u2019m like, listen, you know, Goldman Sachs or Coca-Cola or whatever, I\u2019m like, you know, you\u2019re used to having the most advanced technology, and you need a whole bunch of sort of techno priests to manage it. And, you know, you hire my advanced PhDs from Wharton to run it, and you have the consultants who could afford to build the backend systems. \n\nBut the AI that you\u2019re using internally is almost certainly worse than what every kid in Mozambique has access to for free, thanks to Microsoft\u2019s Copilot and, you know, running GPT-4, like and that people have not absorbed that completely yet, right, like also that the technological frontier just caught up to everybody at the same time, and there isn\u2019t really a huge advantage. Like companies are shipping models almost as fast as they can get them made out. They\u2019re generally made pretty ubiquitously available or available, at relatively cheap costs most places around the world. And the implications of that are going to play out in really interesting ways that we haven\u2019t anticipated yet.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And so, you know, maybe that\u2019s a good segue to your book. So you\u2019ve written this book, Co-Intelligence. What do you want people most to take away, you know, from reading this book and just in general from, you know, how they ought to be thinking about what\u2019s going on right now?\n \nETHAN MOLLICK: So at least at the current stage, AI really works like a form of co-intelligence. Like, it is a booster to your activities. It is a threat to some parts of your job, but not the parts you want to do. And it is something that is usable right now. \n\nAnd I think a lot of people and a lot of the books about AI have tended to focus on future, and especially sort of scary versus, you know, like, are we all saved or all doomed? And I think that that is an important conversation, but in some ways, the least interesting conversation to have about AI that\u2019s already here. \n\nAnd it\u2019s fascinating because when you talk to people who are using it, they want to talk about how to use it. It feels like the 80s again, right? Like, people want to figure out what are the tips. They\u2019re exchanging information. There\u2019s excitement in the air among users. \n\nAnd I think that I wanted to try and bring that conversation to people and give people ways of getting started. And also to realize, like, this is kind of a big deal, right? It\u2019s a big deal in lots of ways that we would never have expected AI to be a big deal. And it\u2019s a big deal right now. Like, it out-innovates most innovators. It out-writes most writers. Like, you know, elite consultants, it does a really good job. Like, this is weird stuff that is going to have weird effects. And it is accessible. And that\u2019s part of why it\u2019s gonna have such a weird effects.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, I\u2019d love to talk a little bit about benefits, and then we can sort of talk about, you know, maybe the weird downside effects in a minute. But, you know, I\u2019ve been doing machine learning work for 20 years now, and yeah, and have been on the large language model train for, you know, the past, you know, five-plus years, you know, helping OpenAI build their big systems. \n\nAnd like, there\u2019s a handful of things that are, like, just super clear that I think are going to be massive beneficiaries of the technology. And like, they tend in my mind to be things where you have zero sum problems that exist, where the AI like comes in and transforms all of the problem or some important part of it into a non-zero-sum thing. And there are many, many examples in education and health care, I think. \n\nBut like, what are your like, interesting benefits right now, like the things that you\u2019re super excited about and think people ought to be thinking more about?\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: Yeah, on the large scale social side, I think you\u2019re completely right. I mean, the standard I\u2019ve been applying, AI has many things it doesn\u2019t do very well. And there\u2019s things that people worry a lot about how well it does them. But the standard I tend to apply is BAH, Best Available Human. Is the AI better or worse than the best available human you have access to? And especially in areas like education where most people don\u2019t have access to tutors, but that\u2019s a magical tool, that\u2019s transformative, right? \n\nFor areas like, you know, medical advice, like we\u2019re getting good data out of both Microsoft and Google and Harvard Medical School and everyone else right now. They\u2019re like, look, it\u2019s \u2013 you know, I don\u2019t want to replace your doctor, but you probably should be asking for a second opinion from AI and getting help. And your doctor probably should be doing that at least, right. It\u2019s pretty good at legal stuff. Like, there\u2019s a lot of things where access has been gated, where this opens the doors, for reasons good and bad. Education is clearly a giant win. \n\nThe other thing is like, look, when we survey people who use AI, we get the same results almost every time, which is they\u2019re nervous because will this take my job, etcetera, but they\u2019re actually really happy because the first things they give up are the worst things, right? AI maxes out right now at the 80th percentile of ability. A lot of things, it\u2019s much less than that. And \u2013 but whatever you\u2019re best at, you\u2019re probably better than an AI. But there\u2019s probably parts of your job that actually suck that you\u2019re not very good at and that you don\u2019t enjoy. \n\nAnd so, the most liberating part of this is like, people are bored 25% of the time at work in most surveys. The idea that you can kind of give up the parts of your job that are holding you back, and especially as an entrepreneurship professor, the stuff you\u2019re not very good at, the stuff that takes all your time and energy, even though it doesn\u2019t get very far, like that\u2019s fascinating. \n\nI mean, I find it fascinating that the first use almost everyone tells me they put AI to, are actually the most intimate uses, like writing children\u2019s stories for their kids, writing eulogies and wedding toasts, because these are things that cause people enormous amounts of stress, and most people aren\u2019t that good at, right? And so, all they do is spend hours and hours stressed out about it. So to me, it\u2019s this liberating aspect also on the personal level, as well as what it can do to society.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I like that Best Available Human framework because I think it\u2019s a good framing to help you think about how you could ambitiously use it yourself. So, like what is the thing that you want to do or that you feel constrained by, that you need some help with, and like can you get a human to help you, or can you not because, like, you can\u2019t afford to pay them or because, like, they don\u2019t live near you or they\u2019re inaccessible? \n\nLike my example of this is my 15-year-old daughter, who, you know, is a freshman and was taking a biochemistry class in high school this year. And she really, really wanted to read the research literature. And the research literature is not written for 15-year-old kids. It\u2019s like full of jargon. It\u2019s complicated. It presumes a bunch of prior knowledge that you don\u2019t have when you\u2019re 15 years old. \n\nBut conceptually, like, you know, if the research is good, there\u2019s no reason that a 15-year-old can\u2019t understand the kernel of what\u2019s in a research paper. \n\nAnd so, like, her idea is like, all right, I\u2019m just going to feed this thing into ChatGPT and just ask ChatGPT to explain this thing to me, and just, you know, like, I\u2019m going to pepper ChatGPT with questions. And like, she doesn\u2019t have access to a PhD biochemist who can, like, personally tutor her, you know, through her million questions she\u2019s got about these random papers. \n\nBut ChatGPT is like the free version. Like, she didn\u2019t even ask me to do this, right? So it\u2019s like she\u2019s using the free tier of the product, and like, it\u2019s almost like watching a kid develop a superpower. Like, I cannot believe what she understands.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: I mean, it\u2019s amazing, right? I mean, part of what \u2013 you know, I think it was interesting because we thought that, you know, going back to sort of the history of the thing, I think most of us who were nerds in the sort of \u201880s and \u201890s thought that once we had the universal network, that everyone had access to all information, everybody would be seeking out the information they want, and the world would become wise overnight, right? And it turned out to not quite work the way I think the teenagers of the \u201880s and \u201890 nerds thought it would. \n\nAnd I think part of the issue is that we didn\u2019t understand society and we didn\u2019t understand that people have different styles and need different amounts of knowledge and need things to be applicable in their life and different levels of curiosity about different things. \n\nAnd one of the most exciting things about AI is universal translator and not just translator of language, which it does pretty well, but translator of concepts, right? It\u2019s like the weakest way to do that is explain it like I\u2019m 10. The best way to do it is to tell the AI, hey, I am, you know, I\u2019m a 15-year-old, and here\u2019s what my background, and here\u2019s what I\u2019ve studied, and here\u2019s my interest. Can you explain this paper to me in a way that I\u2019d understand, and that it seems relevant to me, and you\u2019ll get a good answer from that. \n\nAnd to me, that is a superpower for all of us, right, because it turns out that just providing access to unfiltered knowledge is not the right way to go. We need help understanding and contextualizing, making it meaningful. And I think that\u2019s incredibly powerful.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So you teach entrepreneurship to very bright young people, and probably old people, too, right, like who I\u2019m guessing you have all sorts of folks in your classes. But, you know, folks who have this curiosity about how the cycle of entrepreneurship works, presumably because they want to go be entrepreneurs or like, participate in the entrepreneurial process. \n\nSo one of the things that\u2019s most exciting to me, when these big technological platform shifts happen is like the opportunities for entrepreneurship are pretty incredible. I don\u2019t know what you are advising your students to do. Like, you know, how to \u2013 you know, like how are you helping them take advantage of the moment or advising them what to do?\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: There\u2019s a lot to talk about there. So we\u2019ll start in the most narrow front, right? Like, I\u2019m a former entrepreneur myself and my startup company invented the paywall in the late \u201890s. I still feel bad about that. I\u2019m trying to make up for it ever since. \n\nBut what I\u2019ve been trying to think about with this is like, okay, right, first of all, we don\u2019t necessarily know what the future is, and things are moving very quickly, and there\u2019s every indication they\u2019re going to keep moving quickly, even if LLMs start to even out, and there\u2019s very divided opinions on when that will happen. But even if they do, there\u2019s still so much low-hanging fruit of other stuff you could do with these systems that no one\u2019s even bothered to attach them to yet, that we\u2019ve got years of disruption ahead of us. \n\nAnd so my advice has actually shifted a lot. Like, I mean, I\u2019ve \u2013 Wharton runs a \u2013 I think we have the second highest number of startups of any school. Like, people raise lots of VC out of classes that I\u2019ve taught and my colleagues have taught. \n\nAnd I think one of the big shifts has been the idea that, like, there is an opportunity here that didn\u2019t exist before. And part of my advice has shifted from, how do you help big companies succeed by providing software and services that they then buy you out for it, to like how do you smash large companies? Has become the new model for us. \n\nI\u2019m talking to venture capitalists. Increasingly, they\u2019re telling me their startups are telling them they don\u2019t want to grow past 20 people. Now, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to be possible or not, right, but I think it\u2019s an interesting change in ambition level from I want to grow as fast as I can to let\u2019s see what we can do at scale, where scale is AI scale, not human scale. \n\nAnd I think that that becomes a really interesting set of questions. And the question becomes like, what large companies can you solve better by having a thousand great servants? Because AI, you know, API calls are expensive at the level of like, if you\u2019re replacing software calls. They\u2019re very cheap if you\u2019re using them to provide magic to people that otherwise humans would have had to provide. And so, part of that is that shift in that direction. \n\nAnd then one other story just to tell you, like so I taught all my students how to build GPTs on OpenAI\u2019s GPT platform. I know Microsoft has similar efforts that are coming out, too, that will make this even more broad, but they\u2019re little agents, little software packages that you know, prompts basically.\n\nAnd I had like 200 students in my class \u2013 in my classes. And the job was you had to come up with a way to destroy the job you were applying for, so that you could go for a job interview and hand someone your GPT and say, my job is done, give me a raise. \n\nAnd I had like Navy pilot, I had hip-hop promoters, and of course, tons of like private equity folks at Wharton. And they did it, like they came up with ways of automating work that people have now adopted and used via the GPT store, like hundreds of different ways I never would have thought about before. \n\nSo I think there\u2019s more low-hanging fruit than we\u2019ve ever seen. I think the question is, how do you stay ahead of a technology that\u2019s evolving? And I actually worry that a lot of startups are not being ambitious enough because they\u2019re fixated on today. Like, how do I use a RAG-based system with, you know, using Llama 2 at the lowest possible cost? I\u2019m like, I think you\u2019re thinking the wrong way about this, right? You can\u2019t be the person who\u2019s conservative about where this technology is going. You have to have a viewpoint about what\u2019s happening next.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I \u2013 I think that\u2019s super good advice. The thing I\u2019ve been telling people for \u2013 like inside Microsoft for several years now and, you know, any of our partners that I\u2019m chatting with right now is being incremental in this moment is like a horrible mistake. Like, the interesting things aren\u2019t things that went from hard to easy, but the things that went from like, impossible to possible. \n\nETHAN MOLLICK: I love it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And like, you know, you sort of want to be right on the ragged frontier, you know, like, this thing\u2019s barely possible, it\u2019s too expensive, it\u2019s like, super hard, it\u2019s a little bit fragile, because all of that gets better. It gets cheaper. The fragile things become robust. It\u2019s going to be extraordinary how all of this works.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: And it would be better to bet on that happening than bet on it not happening, right? Like, we\u2019re on a curve right now. And so, I\u2019m \u2013 look, I\u2019m paying attention, as is this the rest of the world, to how good the next version of OpenAI\u2019s, you know, LLMs are going to be. Like, we\u2019ll see, right? There\u2019s certainly no expectation lowering happening from any of the major labs, you guys or anyone else. Like, so I\u2019m going to keep betting that we\u2019re going to see continued change, because I know that even if the technology stops developing, we\u2019re still going to see continued change. \n\nI\u2019d like to see people do exactly that. Like, when I talk to companies, I always tell them two things. One thing is that something you used to do that was valuable is no longer valuable. And the sooner you realize that, the better off you are, right? \n\nAnd the second thing is, there\u2019s something impossible you always wanted to do that you can do. What is the impossible thing? \n\nAnd I always tell people also, have something that is barely working. Like, I\u2019d love something where the LLMs are just slightly incapable of doing it because you just wait for better brains, and then you\u2019re the first people to take advantage of that. And I think that that\u2019s really important also.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Have you thought at all about, like just on a macro level, what markets get disrupted by this? Because it would be kind of unusual with a big technology transition like this for big things in the market not changing in substantial ways. Like, I know I\u2019ve got my list of things that I\u2019m predicting, but I\u2019m always curious to hear what others are.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: Yeah. I mean, it is \u2013 you know, it\u2019s hard, right? Because I think that a lot of the things \u2013 the shape of the disruption is going to be determined. We have agency over that, right? Like the technology is shifting, but we have a lot of agency over that. \n\nAnd the model I always think about is the Industrial Revolution, and in a way people don\u2019t usually think about, which is steam power came to a lot of factories in England at the same kind of time. The ones that won were not the ones that were like, hey, we could still make pots, but with less people. Those companies got destroyed, right? The ones that succeeded were the ones that said we can now use the same number of people and make 10,000 more pots and ship them all over the world, right? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes. \n\nETHAN MOLLICK: And I think that that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to see happening is the disruption is going to be everywhere. Because look, I can make \u2013 using GPT-4, right, I can make a vending machine that is perfectly persuasive to you and solves your psychological problems, and, you know, it also sells Coke products, right? Like, what do we do with a world where that\u2019s happening is a sort of weird question.\n\nSo I\u2019m looking for imagination coming out of the large companies as an indicator that they\u2019ll be safe, rather than looking at industries. I mean, look, I think we\u2019re going to see disruption in customer service, but a really good version of this would say, how do we extend the customer service process to fit humans into it? \n\nAnd I\u2019m worried about companies not taking the visionary approach and instead just automation as cost cutting. That\u2019s going to be dangerous. And those will be transformed in a negative way. \n\nSo I think we\u2019re going to see this touch everywhere, but I think we have some agency over what happens. And obviously I think that the industries that matter the most are the most white collar kind of, you know, analytical jobs. Like, everyone could use a consultant to help them out, right? And so, the challenge facing BCG or Accenture is not how do I do, you know, serve our current clients with the same number of people. It\u2019s what do I do now that I have increased capabilities, and one person can manage a thousand interns, and I want to see that happen.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I think that\u2019s such a amazingly good point and a push. I think one of the things I wrote in my book is like, I don\u2019t know whether there is the history of any company that somehow or another innovated its way into the future by focusing only on cutting costs. You know, and I do think that\u2019s an important thing for enterprises. Like, you have to figure out how to innovate and serve your customers better, and to reinvent yourself over time and to respond to competition. And like all of that requires what you just said. Like, I\u2019ve got tools and I\u2019ve got human capital, and like, how can I put those two things together in like, really inventive ways to invent the future? \n\nETHAN MOLLICK: Yeah, and I \u2013 not to sound, and I want to make clear to listeners, I don\u2019t take money from Microsoft or any other AI lab, but I think now is the time not to sound too Microsoft pro AI lab, but I think now\u2019s the time not to worry so much about keeping your API costs as low as possible, and to view this stuff as R&D, right, for a future. I think we need to be thinking about, like, you know, you need to be doing R&D because there\u2019s no instruction manual. And I think too many companies are kind of paralyzed and people are paralyzed waiting for like the secret recipe book, and there isn\u2019t one, right? \n\nLike I\u2019ve talked to everyone building on. You do, too. It\u2019s not like we know the full set of capabilities. If I told you how good is this for, you know, for helping people who are chemical engineers working on long distance pipe, you know, we don\u2019t even know what their jobs are. But I guess, you know, the people who can figure that out are the people at chemical companies working on pipe engineering. They will know very quickly what it\u2019s good or bad at. \n\nAnd what I worry about is them pausing or waiting for a consultant to tell them the answer, because nobody has that answer. Your expertise is the key to multiplying your effect right now. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I think the other, you know, interesting thing here is, you know, again, I do have a point of view about whether or not we\u2019re reaching the point of diminishing marginal returns on model power. I don\u2019t think we are. And you know, the structure of how these systems get built is you go build a gigantic supercomputer and then you go train a model on it, and then you release the model to the world, and then you start the whole cycle over again. And, like, they\u2019re actually overlapped at this point, but it takes a while to, like, go build the supercomputers and then train the next model. And so, that doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t have an exponentially improving process. It just means you\u2019re sampling the exponential like once every, you know, couple of years.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: Yes, I love that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And you just can\u2019t get confused that, you know, like you got the last sample and now everything is linear.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: And I worry. I mean, I worry about that and I really do think, like, you know, I think that, you know, I get that people are worn out from tech cycles, right? Like, I think the NFT world did a lot of people in of like, you know, because it illustrated everything of a tech cycle. But like, the truth is we haven\u2019t had a bust, right? \n\nLike \u2013 and the companies I talk to are being transformed. Like, I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone who\u2019s done internal implementations of AI systems, who\u2019s like, you know, this didn\u2019t do anything for us. Like, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty out there, but in terms of actually embracing it, building it, you know, into their systems and thinking about it, that they don\u2019t find benefit, I\u2019m just not hearing that very often. Most companies are just getting started and barely thinking about it. \n\nAnd, you know, we\u2019re not going to see evidence in productivity numbers for a while. Systems take much longer to change than technologies. But that doesn\u2019t give you a license to ignore it. \n\nAnd I think there\u2019s no one who uses these systems for 10-plus hours. That\u2019s why my borderline in my book is 10 hours of, you know, frontier, you know, copilot and, you know, in GPT-4 mode or GPT-4 quad three, you know, Gemini 1.5, whatever it is. You need to put 10 hours in with that. And if you are still unconvinced, I get it, right? But like, yeah, I don\u2019t meet many people who aren\u2019t.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So how do you get people to be optimistic enough? And, like, the last thing that I would ever encourage anyone to do is to be blindly optimistic about anything, especially, you know, blindly optimistic about things where they\u2019re investing a lot of their money or a lot of their precious time into. But this is one of those areas where you need just enough optimism and curiosity, where you are pushing. Otherwise, you know, I think you get yourself into a little bit of trouble, you know, just in the sense that, you know, people who lean all the way in and use the tool to its best effect are going to have big advantages over people who don\u2019t. \n\nAnd like, the only thing really, you know, given how cheap the tools are, that prevents you from leaning in is like your own psychology, you know, like your own, you know, willingness to go experiment and try.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you, like, just speaking about Microsoft, like it was an interesting thing when GPT-4 was first available, trying to get people to, like, go use it as ambitiously as they should, because, you know, they had all of the perfectly reasonable reasons for why they shouldn\u2019t. And the longer everyone waited, like the \u2013 you know, the less well-off they were, like, relative to like, trying to accomplish the thing that they were trying to accomplish.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: Yeah. I mean, so, listen, I actually think you need to have a crisis in some ways. Like, I don\u2019t mean to \u2013 like I am very optimistic, but I think you have to get through a crisis one way or another. Like I call it the three sleepless nights. Like, you have to have a moment where you\u2019re like, oh my God, this feels like it\u2019s not a person, it\u2019s not alive, but it feels alive. It could do parts of my job I didn\u2019t expect. Like, you have to kind of push past because there\u2019s a lot of psychological resistance. There\u2019s some weirded-out-ness. There is natural skepticism, overhype. There is anxiety. And I find a lot of really smart people that I talk to are like, I kind of walked away from it, right? \n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that most people use one of the free models, and those aren\u2019t as good, right? Again, if you\u2019re going to use a free model, it has to be use copilot in creative GPT-4 mode. Like, you need to use a frontier model to figure out what\u2019s going on.\n\nAnd you need to do your 10 hours, and you\u2019re going to have a crisis. Like, it is weird. It is something we\u2019ve never kind of contacted another form of intelligence before. It\u2019s a weird form of intelligence. It\u2019s not human. It\u2019s not sentient. It doesn\u2019t have goals. But it will fake that all for you initially. And then once you get through it, you\u2019ll be fine. But you have to get there. And I think it\u2019s very uncomfortable and hard for people to push through. \n\nAnd then afterwards you start to find liberating uses for this. Like, that\u2019s what I tend to find is very few people seem to be continually upset afterwards because they start to find places where like, this sucks, I don\u2019t want to do this part of my job, and the AI will handle it for me. And if you start with the high friction parts, you\u2019re in good shape. \n\nNow, there\u2019s places where that\u2019s bad. My students are like, too many people are cheating everywhere. They were already cheating, but now AI makes cheating even easier, right? And like, there are things we have to do that are hard things that are human things. But I think that pushing through and getting those 10 hours and getting to the crisis and just realizing it\u2019s something you have to go through, like this is a \u2013 there\u2019s a change happening, and it\u2019s exciting, but it\u2019s also unnerving in a deep way. \n\nAnd, you know, one of the things I\u2019ve talked to people at Microsoft is like, how do we help people both go through the crisis but then feel positive afterwards. And I don\u2019t think we have an easy answer to that set of questions. But I do think that the discomfort is part of the process.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, almost everyone that I know, like both optimists and pessimists, have had the crisis that you are talking about. And like, funny enough, the optimist crisis is really that the fundamental mechanism of these transformer-based models isn\u2019t that complicated? I mean, there\u2019s a huge amount of complicated stuff underlying it. And like, I\u2019ve seen people have the flavor of crisis, which is like, all right, like I actually understand the mechanism of this thing. How on God\u2019s earth is it getting in the ballpark of things that I thought I was good at? Like, does that mean that I\u2019m a stochastic parrot? Does it, you know, it\u2019s really interesting like watching that.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: That is 100% one of the most common forms of this is, oh, my God, are we just this, right? And I think you come to the conclusion that we\u2019re not just this \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, correct.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: But something like this is part of what we do. But that\u2019s not that \u2013 that, you know, it\u2019s sort of like saying being a biochemist, you know everything about how a person works because, you know biochemistry. \n\nLike, but there is a crisis there, right? There is a \u2013 nothing was close to us this way. It\u2019s like finding out that, you know, that dolphins really can talk and they\u2019ve been talking about you behind your back the whole time. Like, there is something startling about this. \n\nBut I think that, you know, it is reconstructable afterwards. I think there\u2019s lots of open questions about why is it so good, how does it compare to the human brain? But I think the kind of naive view is probably wrong, right? It\u2019s not \u2013 we\u2019ve found something that works kind of like \u2013 I\u2019ve always liked Stephen Wolfram\u2019s kind of argument that there is a statistical pattern to language, which means statistical patterns of thought, and you can reproduce that without necessarily thinking. But it\u2019s tough. We don\u2019t have the answers to these questions really yet. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: No, we don\u2019t. Yeah. These systems are ill understood. Our own cognition is ill understood. Like, it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s an interesting, interesting set of vagaries here. But like if you can sort of look at the thing as like it\u2019s just a tool, like I\u2019m going to try to figure out what the tool is good for, then you can do interesting things with it.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: And I think that that tool analogy is important, right? It\u2019s many things. Like, it\u2019s weird because you have to both keep thinking about it as a tool, but you also have to treat it like a person to get the best results from it. So it\u2019s hard for people to keep both those things in their head at the same time. \n\nBut the problem is that both analogies are kind of bad, right? Like, I hear privacy concerns from companies all the time that don\u2019t make a lot of sense, because they\u2019re privacy concerns you wouldn\u2019t have about any other tool in the cloud that everyone\u2019s using all the time, right? So it\u2019s very weird to see people being panicked, like, but it knows everything. I\u2019m like, well, I mean, are you worried that Dropbox is stealing all of your data? You\u2019re not, right? \n\nSo part of this is this kind of conversation about like, oh, they\u2019re thinking like an entity that\u2019s learning stuff. So if you show it something, everybody\u2019s learning the thing you\u2019re showing it, and it\u2019s not working that way either. \n\nSo it\u2019s a little tough to keep both things in your mind at one time, but you kind of have to. And I think once you use it, a little bit of the magic wears off at the same time, but the usefulness increases. And that\u2019s a good place to be.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So what are some of your concerns about the technology?\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: So I think I\u2019ve kind of \u2013 I mean, there is a bunch of baked-in bad stuff that\u2019s going to happen one way or another, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s stoppable at this point. Like, we have a perfect phishing machine. The world is going to get filled up with AI slop, right? Or anything since 2022 is going to be contaminated with AI information. You know, and I use contaminated in both good and bad ways, right? Like, we have a different information ecosystem than we had before. No matter what we do to do watermarking or other approaches, open source solutions that are out there that are powerful enough that they\u2019re going to get around whatever barriers are put in place and that die is cast, right? \n\nSo the nature of IT security is going to have to change fairly dramatically. The nature of how we treat online information is going to have to change fairly dramatically. There is going to be some escalation of scams. And I mean, there\u2019s bad stuff that\u2019s going to happen that\u2019s almost 100% certain going to happen.\n\nYou know, and there\u2019s social changes that are going to be, you know, the job disruptions that I think we will see one way or another. The fact that people are going to make AI friends, right, like this is going to be something we\u2019re going to have to deal with. And we don\u2019t know whether or not it becomes one of these things that at some point people are like, okay, I\u2019ve had enough, I want to have like real friends too, or whether there\u2019s \u2013 this is going to be too compelling. AI is very persuasive. \n\nLike, these are already baked-in changes, and I think we need to start mitigating negative effects. What I\u2019m worried about is sometimes we focus too much on AI will wake up and murder us all, and not so much on what do we do to regulate a machine and a thing we\u2019ve seen before, which is a machine that can do a lot of things that are good and bad. How do we mitigate the bad effects, while allowing the good effects to happen? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nETHAN MOLLICK: So I think that\u2019s my real concern. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and you know, I think the encouraging thing from the historical record is like, we\u2019ve got plenty of expertise at figuring out how to regulate technologies that are ubiquitous. \n\nLike one of my favorite examples is electricity. So electricity in many different ways is a potentially lethal technology. And, you know, we regulate how it\u2019s generated. We regulate how it\u2019s transmitted. We regulate how it is terminated and connected to your house. We regulate the appliances that consume it. Like, we regulate the people who work on all of the different systems. And, you know, and still even then, like a small number of tens of thousands of people in the United States die from accidental electrocution every year. And we have all of that, and like it is completely unimaginable to everyone how you would live your life without electricity. And there are many other technologies like that.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: Yeah. I mean, I think we\u2019ll figure it out, right? I mean, part of this is we have to figure it out. And one of the things that I like the sort of policy implications that Josh Gans, who\u2019s a professor at UC Toronto, has been saying, which is, look, when you don\u2019t know benefits or risks, what you need is fast, smart, responsive regulation where you look for emerging harms and then you regulate, right? \n\nAnd so, we know there\u2019s emerging harms around identity and there\u2019s emerging harms around fakes. You know, like we should be thinking about how we\u2019re solving those policy concerns. \n\nI think that it\u2019s worthwhile to think about the sort of danger scenario of what happens if we do have a sentient machine that\u2019s smarter than all humans. But I feel like compared to the other kinds of risks that we know are happening and the other benefits, like micro regulation is actually really needed. \n\nWhen I talk to industries, right, one of the major problems like financial services has is they\u2019re not clear what the regulation is. So they can\u2019t act as much as they want to, because the regulation was written for algorithmic forms of AI, where the decision was about AI decision-making, you know, in FICO scores and things like that. And that\u2019s not really relevant to LLMs. \n\nSo we need positive regulation too that carves out room to experiment. How does this work in medicine? What are HIPAA requirements? Like, the people who are sort of anti-regulation, also we live in a system that\u2019s already regulated. Like, there\u2019s already choices that have been made.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And it\u2019s a thing worth reminding folks, like there\u2019s plenty of regulation already that applies to AI. Like, you know, AI can\u2019t write prescriptions; only doctors can. And, you know, even there, like, someone will have to figure out, like whether or not and to what extent a doctor can take a recommendation from an AI and use that to write a prescription for a medicine that goes to a patient. Yeah, AI models are not FDA 510(k) compliant. So, like, you can\u2019t use them as a medical device. So like there\u2019s just a bunch of regulation right now, and some of it actually you may need to relax because the benefits are going to be so blaringly really obvious for the public, it will help us solve so many problems, you\u2019re probably going to want to change the regulation even in the other direction to, like, make things more permissive than they are right now.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: Fast experimentation is going to be key. So we need to figure out ways to allow fast experimentation to happen. But it\u2019s also fair that like there\u2019s going to be downside risks everywhere. It\u2019s a general purpose technology, right? Those come along once every generation or so. And you know, computers plus internet was the last one. And turns out we needed to put a lot of regulation in place about how that operates. But we also had to allow experimentation. \n\nAnd I think it\u2019s important to view this as a technology with you know, there are enough smart people who think there\u2019s substantial world-ending risk that I want to take that seriously, but I\u2019m much more worried about, you know, in the short term, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough discussion about how we allow the good stuff to thrive and the bad stuff to stop and what that looks like. And, you know, how do we let experiments happen the right way but regulate quickly? That feels, to me, like a much more important question to have answers to than sort of, you know, than we\u2019re giving attention to.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Cool. So, looking forward to the next handful of years, like what are you most excited about?\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: I have been trying to teach education at scale for a long time. I started working at the Media Lab on this back in the mid-2000s. I worked on DARPA projects on using games for training at scale. I\u2019ve been building tools to teach business skills. \n\nIt turns out something we don\u2019t teach enough is like you teach someone how to network or how to pitch or any of this stuff, and like their life changes actually in controlled studies. Like, it\u2019s amazing. Small amounts of skills because we don\u2019t actually teach those to most people, and they\u2019re very useful, right? \n\nAnd so, I\u2019ve been building games and simulations to teach at scale for a really long time and watching like what happens. Like, I\u2019ve got these massive online video courses that a couple hundred thousand people have taken. And, you know, as much as I like, the MOOCs are a terrible way to teach. You\u2019re watching a bunch of passive videos. \n\nSo to me, the education stuff is such a low-hanging piece of, you know, fruit here, which is, you told me with your daughter already moving ahead of class, we\u2019re going to have to start relaxing some of our ideas of teaching. But it\u2019s going to be great also for teachers because, I mean, it\u2019s very funny when I hear teachers feel threatened in some way because, you know, I\u2019m a teacher, too. \n\nBy the way, you know, business school professor is going to be one of the most disruptive jobs on all of the O*NET lists, right? It\u2019s number 22 out of 1,016 jobs of most disrupted jobs. \n\nBut disruption doesn\u2019t mean destruction. I have to teach hundreds of kids in my classes. I don\u2019t get to know all of them because I can\u2019t, right? I can\u2019t reach all of them. When I teach a classroom, I\u2019m a pretty good teacher, but I kind of have to teach to the middle or the high end of the class. What happens if you\u2019re stuck? Suddenly we have systems that can help bring everyone up to speed, that can help us dynamically develop learning environments that work, that can be individual tutors. Like, to me, this is undeniably exciting, and it\u2019s ready. Like, we can get there with today\u2019s technology. And to me, like that\u2019s a burning need.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I totally agree. And like I think it\u2019s up and down the stack. Like, you look at the number of kids who don\u2019t have access to the full set of educational resources that could help them flourish, it\u2019s in the developing world, it\u2019s in, you know, school systems in part of the country that are just sort of underinvested in for a whole variety of reasons. And like, honestly, it\u2019s even the elite institutions. \n\nSo, you know, I look at some of these elite schools where they\u2019re like, oh, we only admit 5% of our applicants or, you know, 4% of our applicants. And I\u2019m like, that\u2019s a just appalling thing because, you know, everybody who applies to MIT, I mean, like, not everybody, but like some crazy proportion of them are like, outstandingly talented, and like the fact that you got to draw the line, you know, like it\u2019s kind of nutty.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: Talent is much more evenly distributed than opportunity. And our biggest cost is that, right? There are talented people all over the world who don\u2019t have access to opportunity. And like, the fact that we can close any of that gap will be a net benefit to everybody. \n\nAnd like listen, I\u2019ve been working in education for a long time, and there was a shift from sort of utopian technological solutions, right, like one laptop per child and all of these, like we just give people technology and everyone thrives, which kind of comes from our \u201880s nerd that we mentioned earlier, which was like, oh, we learned how to code by just being given a laptop; everybody should. \n\nIt turns out that\u2019s not true. There\u2019s social systems in place. There\u2019s problems at all levels of society. There\u2019s been a big shift to thinking about those things, which I think are really important.\n\nBut I actually think we\u2019ve kind of lost a little bit of the technological optimism of, like, hey, maybe there are tools that can help solve these problems, and it doesn\u2019t have to all be like the most grinding social change.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what excites me the most is like restoring a bit of that optimistic piece, while still worrying about downside risks. For example, the default, all the models right now, if you ask them to teach, they all want to use learning styles, which is actually 95% of teachers believe they\u2019re real, but it\u2019s debunked as a learning method. Like you don\u2019t actually learn better when you\u2019re taught \u2013 if you\u2019re a visual learner, you should not be just taught visually actually. It makes you a worse student because you should be learning in multi-modes, and learning styles don\u2019t really work. But the AI has absorbed this because that\u2019s what most people think. So we have to tell the AI, don\u2019t use learning styles when we build a tutor. \n\nSo it\u2019s not like you can use this stuff completely unsupervised, but at the same time, it\u2019s pretty good out of the box and best available human. Is it better than what you have access to right now?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah,  100%. \n\nCool. Well, maybe a couple more questions before we go. So maybe this isn\u2019t even an AI question. I\u2019m sort of interested in what\u2019s on the mind of your students. So, like they\u2019re entering a really interesting world right now. And like, you know, AI notwithstanding, like what\u2019s on their mind as they\u2019re approaching the future? Like, what are they anxious about and what are they, you know, optimistic for?\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: I mean, I\u2019m seeing entrepreneurship continue to be really exciting for a lot of them. I mean, I think that the question everyone asks me all the time is like, well, how will jobs change, and, you know, what should I do? \n\nAnd I say, you know, I think we\u2019ve all learned don\u2019t try and predict any individual job. I mean, there are some fields that I think are riskier than others, but, you know, they\u2019re already having issues, right? Journalism is in decline, sadly, for \u2013 you know, for a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with AI. \n\nBut, you know, I don\u2019t tell people to switch jobs because of this, right, and I think the question is figure out what you\u2019re good at more than anything else and double down on that. \n\nSo I think part of this is the uncertainty. I mean, but it\u2019s been uncertain times for very long time, right? Like I started teaching right after the Great Recession started, right?, and the collapse of the housing market. There\u2019s not really that many times where everyone\u2019s like, yes, everything is super stable right now. \n\nSo my students have panicked from time immemorial and they seem to do really well. The thing I\u2019m also trying to tell them is like, the one thing that\u2019s definitely happened is careers are now long. You\u2019ll do many things over your career. You shouldn\u2019t over-index on your first job, your first thing you\u2019re doing. Maybe you stick with it right? Maybe you have a long career there. But like, people move, jobs change, the world changes, and you\u2019re going to be okay. Stay flexible. You know, make luck work on your side as best you can. And I think most people work out, you know, everyone has setbacks, but there\u2019s ways forward in most cases.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. All right, last question. So you\u2019re just super busy right now. You know, I think before we hit record, you know, both of us were talking about all of the many things that we\u2019re off, you know, doing that are supplements to, I guess, our day job. But like, given how busy you are and how interesting the work is that you\u2019re doing right now on AI, what do you do in your free time? Like, what\u2019s your passion?\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: So, you know, family and I are really close. We do all kinds of fun trips and doing stuff together. My solo activity is I\u2019m a gamer. And that\u2019s my sort of stress relief and kind of fun. I do a lot of, like these very hard kinds of games called roguelike games that I happen to really enjoy, that \u2013 where you lose most of the time. And I find that a really interesting randomness plus trial, plus figuring out how you solve things. So I do a lot of games, a lot of gaming. \n\nAnd it sort of runs right into AI, because what I end up doing is kind of combining the two a lot. I like to figure out how the AI could do something. Thinking about how AI as a game designer is a really interesting approach to working with it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, that\u2019s super, super cool. \n\nWell thank you so much for taking time out of your schedule to chat with us and thank you for being a optimistic voice. Like, I think the thing that you are doing is genuinely helpful right now. I think getting people excited enough to, like, give this stuff a try is going to help them do super interesting things in the future. So like that encouragement is really essential, I think.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: That\u2019s great. I mean, and the funny thing is, I feel like I\u2019m a pragmatist, right? I just think that the voices of non-optimism kind of get drowned out. And so like, I\u2019m never saying like, oh, do this at all costs. We\u2019ve just talked about regulation. Like, I don\u2019t think this is like we need to push every lever forward. But like, how can we not look at some of these changes and not be excited for what they can bring? And how \u2013 especially because we have agency now. Like, this is the time to shape what these things look like. \n\nAnd that\u2019s an exciting time to be, right? Like, we don\u2019t get to choose the moment we\u2019re born, right? This is an interesting moment, and I hope people see that and see that they can shape their world a little bit in their own image.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, well, that is a beautiful note to end this on. Thank you very much for being with us today.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: Thank you for having me.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: What a fantastic conversation with Ethan Mollick. \n\nSo I just have to say, you know, you mentioned his energy before you interviewed him and you\u2019re dead on, like, the energy that comes across through his newsletter and his social media posts is even more obvious, you know, when you hear him talk and see how excited he gets about this stuff. \n\nAnd I\u2019m very, very envious of his students because, you know, like, I would love to take classes from someone like him. I loved the idea that he had, you know, with one of his classes of saying, okay write a resume and now write something that is going to make your job go extinct. And what a great thought exercise on so many levels. I love so many things about that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it really is. Like, honestly, it\u2019s, you know, funny enough, some of the most successful people I know, that\u2019s exactly how they have run their entire career. It\u2019s like everything they do, they are trying to figure out like, all right, well, how can I obsolete myself? Because it\u2019s a great thing. Like, if you\u2019re going to have career progression, like, you need to figure out, like, how to, like, do the thing that you are already doing well enough so you can, like, just set it aside and go do the next thing.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I mean, exactly, I completely agree. It gets you out of your comfort zone. I think it helps people realize I have \u2013 what other problems can I solve and what other things can I take on. And, you know, to misquote, you know, Clayton Christensen, you know, like, disrupting yourselves, I think is really important. \n\nAnd so, that\u2019s what I loved about that idea was that it\u2019s, you know there\u2019s so much discussion happening around AI, especially generative AI right now and some of the downsides, and you two talked about that a little bit. But I think that sometimes what\u2019s lost in that is the opportunities, not just when we think about, you know, how much more efficient we\u2019ll be and whatnot, but how we can maybe force ourselves to have to think about things that we ourselves do differently. If this is not my career, then what else would I do? I think that\u2019s a really interesting thing that this technology opens up. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Yeah, and look, like he also pushed on this very real point that we\u2019re quite a ways away from having AIs that can do what we understand right now as full jobs. Like, they\u2019re really good at doing task you know. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And you know, like, the thing that\u2019s changing over the years is like, the scope of the tasks that they are able to do or assist with is getting broader and broader. But, you know, it does tend to be that the things that they\u2019re useful for at first is not the most exciting stuff that you\u2019re doing in the first place. Like, everything that I use AI for is sort of the most annoying parts of my job.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes. Yeah, no, same. And I \u2013 as somebody who\u2019s always loved automation and things like that. That\u2019s why, you know, this wave has been so exciting. \n\nBut no, your point, yeah, it\u2019s usually not the exciting stuff. But yet I think, almost paradoxically, and you see this with Ethan\u2019s work and the things that he shares, it\u2019s like that\u2019s what unlocks the potential because it\u2019s like, okay, if we can do this, then we can start imagining other things that this can help enhance, which is really powerful.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, for sure. And like just in general, I think the energy that he\u2019s radiating right now feels to me a lot like the energy that lots and lots of people were radiating during the PC revolution and the internet wave. I mean, it was such an exciting time, and I feel like we\u2019re back there again, that this is yet another one of those uniquely exciting times where a new thing has come on the scene, it has so much possibility and potential in it. And like, if you are curious and ambitious and, you know, like are willing to go build on top of the thing, like you\u2019re going to be able to do some interesting stuff. And some of it will fail and like, we\u2019ll learn in failure, and like some of it will, like, really make a difference, I think.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I completely agree. And one of the things that I appreciate very much about Ethan is that, as you mentioned before, like he\u2019s trying these things out. He\u2019s encouraging other people to try these things out. So that, I think, also helps, you know, make people more comfortable. Okay, well, let me play this, let me try this out, which is, I think, you can correct me if I\u2019m wrong on this, but that\u2019s a little bit different than what we\u2019ve had in, in previous revolutions, because the barrier to entry now is more accessible than it\u2019s been before. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, 100 percent.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And \u2013 which, you know, you talked about your daughter and how she\u2019s using things, right? Like, this is everyone has access to \u2013 well, not everyone, but we\u2019re working on making these tools accessible to as many people as possible. And that, I think, you know, means that the excitement that can come around this and the education, as Ethan was talking about, that can come around this has so much potential, separate from \u2013 from the technological advancements.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, I do think the power of the things that people have access to that are literally, freely available, as long as you\u2019ve got an internet connection and access to a computer, and like, those are like two big things that we shouldn\u2019t take as given. Like, we still live in a world where, like a lot of us probably do take it for a given, like internet access and having a computer, like whether it\u2019s a smartphone or a PC, like not everyone has, by a long shot. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: For sure.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But if you do have those things, like if you\u2019re connected, like the power of the tools that you have free access to is just extraordinary. Like, they have never been more powerful or giving you more capability to do more things. And like that to me is exciting. So, you know, more people have these superpowers now than have ever had them before.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Absolutely. And I\u2019m glad that we have leaders and educators like Ethan who are out there helping encourage and unpack what these things mean, and, and you know, help propel things forward. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yep, agree.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right, well, that is all the time that we have for today.
