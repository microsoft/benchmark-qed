{"episode": "Ep-62 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Xyla Foxlin", "text": "XYLA FOXLIN: It\u2019s like the only job in the world that I can think of where I can learn something new every single day, like every single month. And I get to follow whatever whimsy or creative exploration catches my eye. I don\u2019t have to ask a boss about it. I don\u2019t have to justify it, because it\u2019s almost like being curious is my job. And that part is, like, the best.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer and EVP of AI at Microsoft.  \nToday, tech is part of nearly every aspect of our lives. We\u2019re in the early days of an AI revolution promising to transform our lived experiences as much as any technology ever has. On this podcast, we\u2019ll talk with the folks behind that technology and explore the motivations, passion, and curiosity driving them to create the tech shaping our world. Let\u2019s get started.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m cohost, Christina Warren, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And today, we\u2019re bringing you a conversation with Xyla Foxlin, a super interesting person who\u2019s only five years out of college but is already making a big impact as a maker, and an engineer, and a person helping build pathways into STEM for women and people of color. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I have been a devoted fan of Xyla\u2019s YouTube content for years now. And I can\u2019t even remember when I became aware of her channel, but, like, she\u2019s just sort of in the mix of all of this maker content that is my favorite thing in the world to watch. \n\nAnd I love her breadth of interest. She, you know, she\u2019s interested in everything from making rockets, like, hilarious rockets, sometimes. Like, she I think has at least got a couple of videos where she launches a Christmas tree, like, hundreds of feet into the air, like, fully lit and like, just the technological challenge of doing that is super interesting. \n\nBut, you know, she does rockets, she does furniture. She does - you know, she\u2019s made videos about making propellers for airplanes. She\u2019s just a really talented maker and does an unbelievably fantastic job, I think, presenting how making is done. And, you know, I think she\u2019s a, like, role model for all of us, honestly. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, I can\u2019t wait to hear this interview. I can\u2019t wait for this conversation.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Xyla Foxlin graduated from Case Western Reserve University in 2019 with a BSE in General Engineering and a concentration in Mechatronics and Creative Technology, as well as a minor in studio art. She began YouTubing in college with the channel Beauty and the Bolt as a way to provide public makerspaces access to free tutorial videos. \n\nXyla was also the founder and CEO of Parihug, a company focused on integrating emotions and technology to create a fuller digital experience. She\u2019s previously worked at Disney Imagineering R&D, and iRobot. She was named as one of Cleveland\u2019s Most Interesting People 2017, Crain\u2019s Cleveland Businesses Notable Women in Tech 2018, and 20 in their 20s in 2016, and was crowned Miss Greater Cleveland 2018 in the Miss America program. Her inventions have been featured in The New York Times, The Verge, Mashable, Google Made with Code, and more. \n\nXyla, welcome to Behind the Tech. Thank you so much for being here with us today. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Thank you for having me. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So I\u2019ve been watching your videos for a while now. and hopefully eventually we\u2019ll get into, like, how you are interested in the things you\u2019re \u2013 or why you\u2019re interested in the things you\u2019re interested in. But, like, maybe we could go all the way back to the beginning and like, how did you get interested in engineering and making in the first place? \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah. I think this is what I love so much about the maker movement specifically is I think that when I was a kid, it was sort of like you were interested in engineering or you were interested in art. And it was a little bit gender segregated, but it was also just like those were separate categories. And the maker movement has kind of combined the two. \n\nBut I would say as a kid, I was kind of interested in both, but like mediocre at both of them. I liked tinkering. I liked playing with, like, toys that let you create something. And I think also a big part of it was I was an only child where my parents worked like really, really long hours. So I was kind of home alone a lot with just whatever, recycling, like garbage was around the house. And so, I would entertain myself by making things and like building my dollhouses myself instead of buying them or things like that. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Which was also sort of part of the immigrant experience. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And where were your parents from? \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: China. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Okay. Yeah. So I want to, like, go back for a second, you know, not to turn this into a therapy session or anything, but you said that you were interested in making things and art, and you felt like you were mediocre at both. \n\nAnd, like, this is one of those, like, I felt the same thing myself and still do, honestly. And I\u2019ve got a 13-year-old girl and 15-year-old girl and like, they\u2019re constantly, you know, sort of digging into stuff. And like, their first impression is that they feel like they should be better at a thing than they are when they first start. And like, none of us are good at anything when we start. So like, have you struggled with imposter syndrome?\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Oh, absolutely. I think as an adult, I have come to embrace that being like moderately good at a lot of things is more useful to me than being a true expert at just one thing.\n\nBut there\u2019s this story I tell in probably every talk that I give or like, every time I have a chance to, which is it was my freshman year of engineering school, and I had, like been put in charge of this robot part. I was like the only freshman on the team. And I put it together a couple of weeks before the competition. I had done the CAD myself, and no one had checked it, and nothing fit together. It was like the worst design you\u2019ve ever seen. It was supposed to be like, completely sealing the electronics bay of a robot to regolith, which is like this lunar dirt that\u2019s got some weird static properties. And, like, there was holes in it. \n\nAnd so I had this meltdown on the robotics room floor. It was like two in the morning, I was there by myself. And this grad student walked in, and he just wanted to grab some stuff and get out. And he, like, walked into this crying freshman. And he was like, what happened? Like, what is going on? And I was like, I\u2019m so bad at engineering. Like, I\u2019m not cut out for this. \n\nAnd he looked at me, and he was like, you played an instrument growing up, right? And I was like, yeah, I\u2019m Chinese. I played the violin. And he said, how many hours a day did you practice your instrument? And I was like, I don\u2019t know, like an hour for 12 years. And he was like, how many hours a day have you practiced building things or engineering, making, any of this? And I said, none. And he said, how can you expect to just walk in and be good at it right away? It\u2019s not a natural skill that you\u2019re born with. It\u2019s something you have to develop. \n\nAnd that was like probably one of the most pivotal moments of my engineering career. And I wish that had happened to me when I was like ten instead of when I was 18. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know what this pressure is that we place on ourselves, that we must be perfect at a thing immediately. And like, that was some sage advice that you got from a grad student, like, really, really, really good advice like that.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Right. Especially like a tired grad student who walked in at two in the morning to not talk to people. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. That\u2019s awesome. \n\nWell, so, let\u2019s go back to, you know, when you were a kid. Like, what particular things when you were little did you really like doing? You know, so like, I know some of the things you do now. Like, you make rockets. Like you do a whole bunch of casting and, you know, you make furniture. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, you\u2019ve just got a gazillion things that you do. But like, what was it when you were a kid? \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Honestly, none of that. I was a pretty stereotypical girly girl, I think. I liked playing dress up. \n\nAnd one of the things that I think was one of the early ones was I \u2013 my friends and I got really into those, like, little magnetic animals that bend. Do you remember those? Do you know what I\u2019m talking about? I don\u2019t even remember what they\u2019re called. \n\nAnd we ended up \u2013 my locker at school became Bendyville, and we built, like, this three story mansion for all of these creatures. And I think I was building the really wacky parts of it, like, you know, the moving staircases and the bathtub that had water in it and stuff like that. But it was definitely a \u2013 like, that\u2019s a very, like, dollhouse kind of origin story, I would say.\n\nI got \u2013 and I was really into making my own Halloween costumes, and they were always like, really, really elaborate. \n\nAnd then I had a fifth grade teacher who was like just a \u2013 you know those teachers that will stick with you forever? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: She was one of those. She was so cool. She was like a former wildfire firefighter, and she was a rock climber. And she was just so badass in the eyes of all of us fifth graders. And she was really into engineering, and she really wanted to, like, expose all of her students equally to engineering. \n\nSo she applied for a grant for like, Little Lego Robotics Program, the little Lego Mindstorms from the state. And she won it, and she started this like very small, little robotics program. But her class throughout the year was always filled with engineering challenges. And if you like, won enough of them, you\u2019d get a candy bar or something. And so I was like, so dead set on winning the candy bar, and spending so much time on these engineering challenges because I loved them. \n\nAnd I think in middle school, like middle school is kind of when a lot of girls stop being interested in math and science. There\u2019s like lots of studies on why that is, but I think instilling it in fifth grade, right before I went to middle school and decided I hated math, it was like enough to keep it going. So towards the end of high school, I could like, reach back to those memories and say like, oh, this is something I want to do. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Which is awesome. I mean, maybe we could talk a little bit about that, like why you think \u2013 or like why you know so many young women get discouraged in middle school. \n\nAnd like, you know, I\u2019ve done a whole bunch of stuff over the years with like gender equity and computer science. And like, I\u2019ve got two girls. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: I was going to say; they just left middle school, right? But you \u2013 you\u2019ve made it through. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And like my 15-year-old has, without any kind of pushing from us, decided that she\u2019s really excited about medicine and biology. And funny enough, like the thing that she credits her interest in medicine in is like, we, as like very, very bad parents, weren\u2019t paying close enough attention to her network consumption habits. And she, like way too young, binge watched an awful lot of Grey\u2019s Anatomy, which we didn\u2019t watch even as adults. And like we went back and watched and it\u2019s like, oh, wow, this was not appropriate for a 12-year-old to be watching. But like, it convinced her that doctors were cool and like, and that was the thing that she needed to go latch on to this thing.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Which is awesome. Yeah. And she\u2019s going to learn about all the adult stuff eventually anyways. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nBut you know, if a kid gets a chance, whatever brings the chance, but if they get the chance to discover that they are interested in and good enough at something where they just want to go put the work in, like you were talking about before, where you just get better and better and better \u2013\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 like that virtuous cycle is sort of the most important thing in the world. \n\nAnd like the thing that \u2013 the thing that is so unfortunate is how often kids don\u2019t even get a chance to get on the trailhead, like, they just don\u2019t \u2013 you know, like they don\u2019t have your wonderful fifth grade teacher or, you know, like my bad parenting and Grey\u2019s Anatomy. And like, they just don\u2019t figure out that, like, hey, here\u2019s the hook. And that, you know, hard things are hard, like \u2013 but, like, you\u2019ve just got to be interested enough to, like,  go do the work to get good. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah, and they have to be in, like, a safe enough environment where they can try things and they can fail. And I think most school systems are not like that. And so, it takes like a family environment or a really special teacher, like you said, to create that environment. And it\u2019s just so hard to do en masse. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I guess it is with math like hard because the way that we grade mathematics is like, you know, there\u2019s a right and a wrong answer to a problem. And if you get it wrong, like oftentimes you don\u2019t get an awful lot of feedback about what to do to get better. And then you just see the bad score at the end, and it\u2019s like, okay, well, I\u2019m bad at this, which is like wrong.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Right. Like it feels very black and white. Until you get up to like, calculus or even pre-calc, where now you\u2019re having \u2013 or geometry actually is a great one where, like you start \u2013 you could get halfway through proving a theorem or you can kind of get most of the way there, and then it feels like there\u2019s some kind of progress. It\u2019s not like a multiplication problem where you either got it right or you got it wrong. But you have to get through that hump.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think, too, with math, like I get frustrated with how we teach it because we sort of very frequently introduce the mathematical concepts, absent any kind of motivation for why this thing is important. And like, that\u2019s not how the mathematical concepts are invented. I mean, there\u2019s some things in, you know, pure mathematics that, you know, get invented just for the sake of the math. But like most math got invented because somebody was trying to solve a problem, and like, they needed a way to model something in the real world or, you know. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Right. Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And like, we just don\u2019t do a good job sharing that with kids early. Unless you have an exceptional teacher. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Right, right. But even an exceptional teacher is working within the bounds of the fact that they\u2019re like, teaching math class. And then the students are going to leave class and go to English class. And they\u2019re going to leave class and go to like science class. And there\u2019s only so much, at least in my experience, there\u2019s only so much the math and the science teachers can do to make their curriculums match up, especially if you\u2019re trying to meet state regulations and state requirements for testing and stuff. \n\nYeah, I think even in engineering school, when you think like the whole curriculum is designed to be applied to the real world, the math was still so separate. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So you got through the gauntlet. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: I did. Barely.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So how did you decide that you were going to go to engineering school or major in engineering when you went to college? Like, what did that decision look like? \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Oh, it was funny, actually. So I applied to college for, like marketing and psychology, I think, which is what the personality test that we took our \u2013 our junior or senior year. I don\u2019t know if your kids have taken this yet. They had us all take an online personality test. And it was like based on your personality, you should be a therapist or you should be in marketing or something like that. And so, that\u2019s what I applied for. I was like, I don\u2019t know. \n\nBut I was captain of my school\u2019s robotics team at the time, so I did first robotics, and \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s awesome. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: My \u2013 the problem was, I was the only girl on the team for a while, and like, girls didn\u2019t really get to build robots at the time. That was sort of just the general culture of first. And so, I had never built on the robot. \n\nAnd when they were assigning everyone a mentor, they asked everyone, like do you want to be on software, or do you want to be on mechanical? And I said, mechanical. And they were like, cool, you can organize all the bake sales. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Ooh.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: So I didn\u2019t get assigned a mentor. I organized all the bake sales, and I raised a ton of money because like, when I decide to do something, I\u2019m really efficient at it. So I became like, the best fundraising outreach person. \n\nAnd all of this was like, I was like, maybe if I do a good enough job, they\u2019ll let me work on the robot. And the problem is that no, if you do a really good job at the thing, then they just give you more of the same thing. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: So then I took over all the outreach programs, which was actually it was really rewarding and fun. And we\u2019d go into schools and teach, like little kids how to work on Lego robotics stuff.\n\nBut then my junior year, I became a captain of the team. And at this point, I had never worked on the robot at all. I had done everything else on the team, including all the video editing. This is how I learned to video edit was I had to make all the team\u2019s videos. And so it had like never crossed my mind that I could actually do engineering because I had sort of been like very subconsciously rejected for the last couple of years. \n\nBut at the same time, I was really involved in the theater program at my high school, and I did tech. And the tech crew was like the polar opposite of the robotics crew. It was all women. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: And it was all just girls who wanted to play with power tools and build sets.\n\nAnd then like, the fact that we actually had to run a show at the end was sort of second to -  we were building multi-story sets, they were all being designed in CAD. It was like this really empowering, amazing group of women. And so that\u2019s how I learned how to actually build stuff was building these sets, and how I learned to use power tools. \n\nAnd then \u2013 I would build the field for the robot. I just wasn\u2019t like building the robot itself. \n\nBut my senior year, we\u2019d all applied to college. We\u2019d heard back. It was the spring musical, and we\u2019re like, sitting around in the tech room, and everyone was discussing what they were going to do for college. And someone was like, Xyla, what are you going to do? And I was like, I don\u2019t know. I got into, you know, these two schools. I gotta decide.\n\nAnd one \u2013 and this girl was like, well, one of those schools doesn\u2019t have an engineering program, so why would you go there? And I was like, what do you mean? And she was like, you\u2019re doing engineering, right? Like you have to do engineering because all of us need to live in your basement when we grow up, because we\u2019re all going into theater. \n\n(Laughter.)\n\nBut it was like a kind of interesting moment where everyone else at the school saw me as an engineer because I was so involved in robotics and I was building stuff. So like, you know, I probably had the skills. And so it was the tech girls that really talked me into it. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s super interesting. I mean, super interesting. I mean \u2013\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: They\u2019re all crushing it and none of them live in my basement, for the record. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I mean, look, my kids both love theater, and like, I love this whole, you know, like, the, you know, theater techs are kind of it\u2019s like being on a pirate crew, so whatever you got to do to get the thing done. And I love it.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: So fun.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: You know, and there are a lot of, like, really famous makers who had that as their path. I mean, Adam Savage was, you know, at a point in his career was like theater tech person. And yeah \u2013\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: You have to think so out of the box because this was \u2013 I mean, this was kind of what we always said at Imagineering, but it\u2019s like: To make someone believe in magic, you have to show them something they\u2019ve never seen before, which means that you have to be always at like, the cutting edge of technology. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, what Imagineering does, I mean, this is a little bit of a tangent, but I think it\u2019s really fantastic because it\u2019s not just like giving people a fantastic experience for the sake of the experience. \n\nLike, you\u2019re sort of showing them something about like a possibility for a world that might be. And I think it\u2019s really inspiring for kids. You know, they just sort of walk into these environments and like, oh my God, like how to \u2013 like, I didn\u2019t know this was possible and how do they do it? And like, I want to do this. Like it\u2019s really cool, that inspiration piece of it. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s a little bit like, you know, when you\u2019re a really small kid and you are believing in Santa Claus, and then you grow up and you realize Santa Claus is \u2013 well, there\u2019s probably not small children listening to the podcast \u2013 is maybe not real. And then it\u2019s like your parents.\n\nAnd I think with Imagineering, it\u2019s a similar thing where it\u2019s kind of like when you\u2019re a really small kid, the whole point is that you believe in the magic and \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: But I think what makes Imagineering so exceptional at what they do is that as you grow up, the magic doesn\u2019t fade, even when you know it\u2019s not like what it is. It\u2019s just so well executed. And like, the technology is so flawless and seamless, that you can, as an adult, still immerse yourself in that world. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, it\u2019s also an important thing for all of us to remember. Like, I think we have this in us when we\u2019re little kids that like, we can believe that the magic is real, like we can believe that the impossible is possible. And you still need that as an adult. Like, I\u2019m sure every day, like you\u2019re encountering things that you thought were impossible or everybody around you thought was impossible. It\u2019s like, all right, how do I make a living as a YouTuber? Like, how do I \u2013 you know, how do I go like, build things that I\u2019ve never built before? It\u2019s like, all about, like, you have to believe this, you know, slightly irrational thing that you\u2019re going to be able to, like, make a very hard thing work. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah, yeah. But now as adults, we have, like the privilege of being the ones that get to fight through it and make it work, which is kind of fun. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It is. It\u2019s a lot of fun. \n\nSo you get to college. You go to Case Western, which has a really good engineering school. So talk a little bit about that. Like, how did you choose which engineering discipline that you wanted to go into and like, you know, what was that like for you? \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah. There was a huge number of my friends that went into Case being like, I am here to do biomedical engineering. That\u2019s why I\u2019m at this school, which is very famous for biomedical engineering, and that is what I want to do. \n\nAnd I was always like, I didn\u2019t even know what BME was until I got here. How on earth did you find this? So I picked mechanical because I wanted to build robots. And that\u2019s \u2013 I feel like mechanical is one of the most obvious forms of engineering. Not obvious, but like everyone knows, that\u2019s kind of like the stereotypical engineering, in a way, maybe? If you want to build things.\n\nAnd then I so I went in actually as mechanical and aerospace engineering because I loved \u2013 I\u2019ve always loved airplanes and flight, and I had worked at an airport in high school to like, get my flight hours and do flight training. \n\nSo I did MechE Aero and like, pretty quickly realized that I didn\u2019t want to do aero because I actually didn\u2019t care about why the planes flew; I just liked flying the planes. \n\nAnd so, I switched aero to electrical because I wanted to be able to like, work on an entire robotic system rather than just the mechanical part of it. Because it was kind of the integration of the two that got me really excited. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think I declared that until \u2013 and I didn\u2019t do a full electrical degree. I did like 75, 80% of a mechanical degree, and then like 20% of an electrical degree, and into a combined degree.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome. And so, you know, what was your experience like? I know \u2013 I know a bunch of folks who have gone to get MechE degrees or double degrees. Yeah, and like my I\u2019m a computer scientist by training. But like, I know a bunch of folks who go to engineering school and they get trained in a flavor of engineering, which is like you sit in, you know, like you got a bunch of software you\u2019re using and like, you sort of think about what you\u2019re building, but you don\u2019t do as much building as you actually might like. \n\nI have a good friend\u2019s daughter who just, you know, a few years ago graduated with a MechE degree from like, a very good engineering school and turned down lots and lots of jobs that were about, you know, sitting in a cubicle doing CAD work, just because she wanted to work in a machine shop somewhere. Which \u2013\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 you know, has been a great choice for her, given what she enjoys doing. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Good.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So I don\u2019t know what that\u2019s been \u2013\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: I hope she\u2019s happy.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 what \u2013 what that was like for you. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah. I had a pretty similar experience, where I\u2019ve never been good at school. Like, I was never good at classroom learning. I have to physically do something to really understand it, or I have to apply something to a project, and then I\u2019ll like, really understand why or how something works.\n\nAnd so, classes in college were a struggle, and I kind of early on in college decided, I mean, I knew I didn\u2019t want to go to grad school. I just wanted to work in industry and be able to like, physically build stuff. \n\nSo I was kind of like, all I have to do is pass. I don\u2019t need to get straight A\u2019s because I\u2019m not applying to anything with my grades. I\u2019d rather be applying to things with a killer portfolio and be doing the thing I want to be doing in the first place, because I think college is \u2013 the value of college is less about the classes themselves and more the environment that you get to live in for four years or five years. And you get access to like machine shops and labs and student organizations and clubs and competitions that are only available to college students. \n\nSo I \u2013 my attendance was like maybe mediocre, but I spent a lot of time in the robotics lab or in the makerspace that I worked at, learning that way. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: So I kind of had to find my own way there. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Which, you know, I think makes a lot of sense. \n\nSo you went to school, you got a great education, and then you\u2019re trying to figure out what to go do. \n\nAnd like at this point, like in school, you\u2019re making YouTube videos already. You\u2019ve learned how to edit from high school. Like, and you went and worked in industry. So like, I know for a lot of folks, like particularly these days, like it\u2019s a dream that you know, you can go be a full time maker. You get to decide, like what you make. You know, you go create, you know, a YouTube channel or like, you know, you figure out how to build a community around you.\n\nLike, how did that progression go? Like, how did you decide, like, hey, this is where I want to go work, and then eventually, like, you obviously like, left, you know these jobs and like, you became \u2013 well, and actually it sounds like twice, like you founded a company. So, like maybe this is the second time you\u2019ve been an entrepreneur.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah. It\u2019s a disease. Run away. (Laughter.) \n\nYeah, I had a really \u2013 I think I had a really unconventional college experience in that my sophomore year, I was at a hackathon, MHacks, which used to be like one of the biggest hackathons in the country. I think it might still be. And I built this like, really silly little teddy bear project where, like if you hugged one, it was connected to the internet, and then the other one would like gently vibrate out the hug and vice versa.\n\nAnd so, we pitched it at the end of MHacks, and this VC from the Bay area, it was like two people who had left the Thiel Fellowship to start their own company, were like, if we give you some money, will you turn this into a company? \n\nAnd so, we were kind of like, how much money. Will it buy us like an egg for our ramen noodles? And so they gave us $1,000 for free. It wasn\u2019t an investment. It was just like a grant. And they were like, you should finish building this prototype and then, you know, try to turn it into a company. \n\nSo we did that. We ended up winning a competition, launched it at the Consumer Electronics Show like later that year. And \u2013 and then that just kind of spiraled into this wild startup experience that I\u2019m glad I had, but I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not still doing. \n\nAnd, and that was the first time I kind of dropped out of college. So at some point when our Kickstarter got funded, I left school so that I could work on manufacturing full time. And then eventually, I shut the company down and went back to school. And in doing that, I got more involved in the makerspace that I had worked at through all of college. \n\nAnd gender equity has, like always been something that\u2019s really important to me, just because, like I look back at my own life, and I\u2019m kind of sad at all the opportunities that I didn\u2019t have because I looked different than like everyone else who was interested in the things that I was doing.\n\nAnd the makerspace, when I was a freshman, we were in the basement of an engineering building. It was like one floor, lots of like, really fun toys and tools, but it had received so much grant money, and the end goal was to move it into this seven-story building. \n\nAnd it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s a really cool makerspace. It\u2019s called Think Box, and it\u2019s in Cleveland. But we moved into that building my sophomore year, and all of a sudden, like all of the way that we, as teaching assistants or like people who worked at this makerspace could help people change. And it went from I could sit down with a person and really walk them through how to use the tools and how to do their project, into someone comes in, tells me what they\u2019re trying to do, and I would put them in front of a computer with like a document that just had instructions on how to use that machine. And it\u2019s a very different experience. \n\nAnd the thing that I noticed was \u2013 and those documents were very overwritten. They were like very engineer-written. So to use a MakerBot, we had like MakerBot Replicator 2s. It was like a 75-page document. Yeah. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Wow. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: So you can imagine someone walks in, and they want to like 3D print a little desk ornament for their sorority sister, and now they\u2019re facing this 75-page document that\u2019s like borderline unintelligible because it\u2019s just so overwritten. \n\nAnd the thing that I noticed. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s a little nutty.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah. But there was, like, so much liability and red tape everywhere because we\u2019re also, like funded by like, people. It\u2019s a university, and it\u2019s funded by the state. \n\nAnd so, I reached out to one of my friends who was a videographer, and I was like, can we try to make video tutorials for all of these machines and see if that helps? Because this \u2013 it was a Saturday shift. I remember this shift so well. I had like eight people come in at the same time. And I was, like really trying to bounce between them, but I still had to follow the policy, which was to put them in front of a computer and show them this thing. \n\nAnd they were like mostly women and girls, like, you know, the range of ages, because it was also open to the public. \n\nAnd every single woman that I put in front of this document, when I like left and moved on to the next person, just like quietly closed the computer and left the space. And I was like, that sucks because we\u2019ve created this amazing space, but it\u2019s a space where, like women and minorities are kind of like not conditioned to feel welcome already. And they talked themselves into going. They like got their confidence together, and they walked into this scary space. And then they got faced with like this massive document. And it kind of like all of the \u201cI can\u2019t do this\u201d crashed back down on them. And then like, they left before I could chase them down and find them. \n\nAnd so, I started making video tutorials on how to use the tools in this space because I thought it would help. And a lot of the research I had done said like a lot of girls stop being interested in math in middle school for some reason, because teachers, they\u2019re used to having female teachers in elementary school, and then all of the math teachers in middle school and high school tend to be men. And there\u2019s like some \u2013 that doesn\u2019t affect boys in quite the same way for some reason. \n\nBut I was like, what if like, these tutorials are being taught by a girl that looks just like them or that\u2019s the same age as them? It\u2019s just another college student being like, hey, this isn\u2019t that hard, you can do it, here\u2019s how. And a five-minute video is so much easier than a 75-page document.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: So we made like ten of these videos and gave them to the makerspace for free. And we were like, hey, we made you some videos; do you want them? And the woman who had just started running the space said no. And I was like, really? Like, they\u2019re free. You can just use it. Like they can be part of the document. And she was like, \u201cNo, someday you\u2019re going to graduate and then there will be no one to maintain the videos. So this is like, not a sustainable path.\u201d So we were kind of irritated, and we were like, fine, we\u2019ll post them on YouTube. \n\nAnd that\u2019s how Beauty and the Bolt, which was the first channel I worked on, was born. And it was, we just were like, maybe people will find them naturally and be able to use the space. Like, they can watch the video at home before they come in. Even if the videos are not supported by the makerspace, it\u2019s still super helpful. \n\nAnd we did see \u2013 we were in the gym, the friend and I who started it, we were at the gym one time, and we saw a girl on a treadmill, like watching the video. And then the next day, I saw her in the makerspace. I was like, yes, score.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s awesome.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: But a couple months later, we got an email from a K-12 school district that was like, hey, like, your videos are really helpful. They\u2019re fully integrated into our curriculum. But we have this one other machine that you don\u2019t have a video for. Is there any chance you have access to this machine, and you could make a tutorial? And we were like, oh, just so happens that we do. \n\nSo we made that video and we put it on YouTube, and we got like a couple more of those. And then this K-12 school district hired us to come to their makerspace and make a bunch of their curriculum videos. \n\nAnd then we did some poking and we were like, oh, we\u2019re listed on like, Harvard\u2019s makerspace website, Cornell\u2019s makerspace website. Everyone was using our videos, except for our own makerspace, which, you know, like just politics. But it was super encouraging to see like, oh, we\u2019re doing work that people actually want. \n\nSo it snowballed into a nonprofit. So it was a 501(c)3. And when I graduated, I decided to work on the nonprofit full time for a year, and just like see \u2013 see how it went. And yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I don\u2019t know whether people fully appreciate how awesome YouTube is as a maker. I feel like anything that you want to figure out how to do, somebody has just been extraordinarily generous and thoughtful with their time and has like, posted something about it.\n\nAnd I mean, for me at least, like I learn probably ten times faster by watching someone do a thing than by reading a book about how a thing gets done. And, you know, also watching someone do it just is a demonstration that the thing can be done. And so, then I\u2019m just more encouraged, well, like, I\u2019m going to go try this. Like, this doesn\u2019t look that hard. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And \u2013 \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: And sometimes it is. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and sometimes it\u2019s super hard, and I\u2019m like, I\u2019m way in over my head, like I need to go get some help. \n\nBut like, you know, surprisingly, like you can figure a ton of stuff out just by watching other people doing it and then trying to go practice yourself. \n\nAnd I mean, like I\u2019m an old man, so like you may not even know what this is, but, like, when I was a kid, you know, we lived in rural central Virginia, and we had, you know, three network TV channels and PBS. And on PBS they had the New Yankee Workshop, which was this woodworking show done by this guy named Norm Abram who, like if you\u2019re at my generation, like he\u2019s, you know, the \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: The guy.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, he\u2019s like, you know, youe Jimmy DiResta or, you know, Xyla Foxlin or whoever your YouTube maker hero is. Like he was \u2013 it was 30 minutes a week, you got to see Norm go make stuff. And it was just enormously encouraging. \n\nAnd like, now you\u2019ve got \u2013\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: That\u2019s awesome.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 everything everywhere all the time, and it\u2019s awesome. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah. Every problem you could possibly want to solve, someone has poured so many hours into it. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And so, I mean, you know, on the one hand, like, thank you for \u2013 for, you know, wanting to do that. And on the other, you know, aside from seeing people, you know, use your content, like you have this intention when you make it, like I want to be helpful to someone in some particular way, like it sounds like. \n\nAnd so, seeing other people like take your content and, like it\u2019s actually helpful, like must be super rewarding. But like, are there other things as well? Like there must be community. There must be, you know, like obviously there\u2019s income and, you know, self-determination about what you do. But like talk about what this is like as a career. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Ooh. It is \u2013 it\u2019s like the only job in the world that I can think of where I can learn something new every single day, like every single month. And I get to follow whatever whimsy or creative exploration catches my eye. I don\u2019t have to ask a boss about it. I don\u2019t have to justify it, because it\u2019s almost like being curious is my job. And that part is, like, the best. \n\nThere\u2019s obviously, like, it\u2019s a lot of work. Like, editing is a lot of work. Creating videos is a lot of work. But in the end, like, I don\u2019t like sitting at a desk. I don\u2019t like sitting still. I like being out in the shop and actually building stuff, and the freedom, just how much freedom a job like this has is amazing. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: How do you choose what to work on, because, like, I feel like everybody has, like, a really interesting creative and editorial process. Like, there\u2019s some people, like, you know, Mark Rober, who\u2019s, like, trying to do, you know, like, a few times a year, like, a pretty sensational thing, and, you know, optimizing for like, I\u2019m going to teach you something very complicated, but I\u2019m going to do it in a way where it\u2019s, you know, going to go viral. \n\nLike, there are a bunch of YouTubers right now that I\u2019ve been watching for years. And, like, I almost feel like what I\u2019m watching is like \u2013 it seems like two years ago, maybe this was a pandemic thing, or maybe it was a maturity thing, like almost every YouTuber I watched, like, started making content about whatever remodeling project they were doing, because they finally made enough money to buy a house. (Laughter.) And now they\u2019re \u2013 \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: (Laughter.) Yep. Luckily, I live in LA, so that\u2019s never going to happen. (Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, like, how do you - how do you pick? And like, you have such a diverse range of things that you\u2019ve done. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah, I think it\u2019s pretty random. And this is probably one of the things I struggle with the most, is a lot of times, there\u2019s a project I want to do because I want it, except that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to do very well on YouTube. And so, I have to kind of pick and choose, like, can I afford to do something like that right now, or do I really need the income from, like, a banger? \n\nAnd something that, like, I , one of the things I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot this year, as we kind of go into the new year, is last year, I accidentally put myself in a situation where I had to churn out, like, four videos a month for a couple of months, which was just, like, a perfect recipe for burnout. And it was in, like, a pretty toxic environment. \n\nAnd I was, like, struggling so hard to keep my head above water. I didn\u2019t have a weekend for months, and I wasn\u2019t proud of any of the things I made, because it was just like, I\u2019ve got to get it done and I\u2019ve got to meet the deadline. Like, get it done, meet the deadline, get it done, meet the deadline.\n\nAnd so, I was kind of like, as I got more tired, I was dialing the projects back a little bit. So, I almost felt like each project was getting progressively easier because I was like, what can I whip out in two days so that I can, like, get eight hours of sleep in four days? \n\nAnd now, as I go into the new year, I\u2019m like, all right, I need to go back to one video a month, and it\u2019s a video that I\u2019m really proud of, because in the end, I had an amazing conversation. I went to a wedding of one of my best friends in October, and at some point I got to just, like, talkign shop with the photographer of the wedding. \n\nAnd so, we\u2019re, like, standing in the corner of this wedding. And I was like, so, you know, \u201cWhat are your plans for the rest of the weekend when this wedding is over. Are you going to get stuck editing?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m actually jumping on a plane to New York, and I\u2019m going to edit these wedding photos on the plane.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh, cool, what are you doing in New York?\u201d And he said, \u201cI\u2019m watering my personal garden.\u201d \n\nAnd I said, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d (Laughter.) And he was like, \u201cI love photography, and I love shooting weddings. because I love, like, being part of, you know, these people\u2019s lives. And it\u2019s really good money as a photographer. But you can\u2019t just keep doing things for other people. You have to go water your personal garden, so that I still love photography.\u201d \n\nAnd so, he was like, \u201cThere\u2019s a photography collective out there. We\u2019re going on a bunch of street walks. We\u2019re going to do, like, graffiti walks. And I\u2019m just going to make art for three days, and then I\u2019m going to come back and shoot, like, an elopement over in Malibu,\u201d or something like that. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: And that was such an amazing conversation that I needed to hear, because this was smack in the middle of my, like, super crazy time. And so, I think it\u2019s really important for creators to also be able to water their personal garden. Not everything we do has to be for sponsors or for agencies or other people. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s sort of tough to do that. Like, I wholeheartedly, you know, believe that and I, you know, support that in all of the people who work for me. And funny enough, like, the making stuff, like, I\u2019m sitting in the middle of a shop right now. Like, I\u2019ve got a CNC machine\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: I know. I\u2019ve been eyeing it. (Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019ve got a Bambu Carbon 3D printer. Like, but I do this entirely to, you know, like, water my own personal garden. Like, I, you know, I love being a computer scientist. I love being CTO of Microsoft. I love helping other engineers be able to build, you know, super complicated things. And I love seeing, you know, how those things, you know, play in the world at massive scale. \n\nBut occasionally, like, I just need to go into my shop and, like, make something with my own two hands. And it takes two hours and then, you know \u2013 and I can be just as in love with one of those things. \n\nLike, yesterday, I, - I\u2019m making this sake cabinet right now. So, it\u2019s got Kumiko doors and, you know, it\u2019s got a place for, like, four little sake cups. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Cool.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m going to \u2013 woodturn them, and I\u2019m going to urushi lacquer them. And then I was going to \u2013 \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Oh my god, I cannot wait to see pictures of this. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, well, I\u2019ll post them on Instagram. And then \u2013 \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Okay.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s got a spot in this cabinet for a sake flask, and I was going to commission someone to make it. And now I\u2019ve, like, talked myself into like, oh, I\u2019m going to slip cast this and, like, you know, fire it and glaze it myself. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: (Laughter.) Amazing.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So, I went out and bought a whole bunch of, you know, tools for slip casting and then, like, you know, they were sitting in my shop and I needed to make a place to store them. And so, a thing that I went and did yesterday is I made some stupid little box that was, you know \u2013 and like, I \u2013 \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: The stupid little boxes can fill your cup.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I took the effort of, like, you know, doing box joints and, you know, like, it was \u2013 it\u2019s just a silly little thing. And I walked over and, like, touched this thing, like, six times during the course of the day. Like, it\u2019s the millionth box I\u2019ve ever made. But I was like, oh, like, isn\u2019t this box nice? (Laughter.) \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: (Laughter.) The human brain is so simple. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it is, but like, I\u2019m guessing a lot of what you do to water your own personal garden looks a lot like what you do to make money. And so, like, there must be an enormous amount of pressure for you to think that you have to turn everything that you make and do into a video, which has to be, like, oppressive at some level. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: It is, and I think it\u2019s also one of those things that\u2019s really hard to talk about, because I have a dream job. Like, I can\u2019t complain about it. But it is a really hard thing where, like, the thing I love to do the most, I now have contractual obligations, which means that, like, if I\u2019m sick, I have to go do it anyway, if I\u2019m tired or something\u2019s happening. \n\nBut, you know, it\u2019s so funny you brought up the box thing, because I did the exact same thing yesterday, where I\u2019ve been procrastinating getting my laser cutter set up in the new \u2013 I just moved \u2013 been procrastinating getting the laser cutter set up in the new house. \n\nAnd finally, yesterday, I got it set up so that I could make \u2013 this new place has a lemon tree, and I\u2019m, like, pawning lemons off on everyone that I know. So, I just made, like, a - a laser cut cardboard, you know, like, box \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Lemon box that has lemons all over it. And I\u2019m having a big party for Chinese New Year this weekend. So, everyone who comes to the party gets to get, like, a little lemon box that has a bunch of lemons in it. And it\u2019s such a silly, tiny thing, but, like, not filming things feels so good sometimes, just doing things for the sake of doing them. But I think it\u2019s also important. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, and not having \u2013 \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: I\u2019m sorry.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And not having a deadline.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah, yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, this thing will get done when I decide it gets done. (Laughter.) \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah, and it\u2019s funny how much little, tiny projects that don\u2019t take very long can still fill this, like, monkey brain part of us that just needs to start and finish something, and feel accomplished, and like, use your hands, design something, and build it. It\u2019s such a therapeutic process. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I completely agree. I really wish - I think more people would, like, have better mental health if they could figure out, like, some way to exercise the, you know, the creative impulse that is in all of us. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And, like, a whole lot of people, just for whatever reason, like, they don\u2019t have an outlet. They don\u2019t feel like they\u2019ve got an outlet. And everybody, I mean, I - everyone in my family, like, did something with their hands. You know, like, my mom, who was a tax preparer, like, just crafted all the time, crocheted, sewed, like made little things to sell at craft fairs. You know, my dad and my granddad were construction workers, but, you know, they worked on cars and made furniture in their shop. \n\nSo, like, everybody constantly, like, had this - you know, like, they just made things. And I think it made them happier than just being in this mode, where all they did was consume things that other people made. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah, and it\u2019s, I think, especially important right now, where we\u2019re, like, so addicted to our little glowing screens, to be able to just put all of that aside. And, like, I personally find woodworking to be, like, exceptional at this because it\u2019s a tree. It used to be a tree. And when you work with wood, you have to think about the way that the tree lived, and the way, like, where it came from, and what its properties are and how to work with it and not against it.\n\nAnd, like, any time that I\u2019m not working, pretty much, I\u2019m outside, like, camping, climbing, backpacking, canoeing somewhere. And so, it\u2019s like, this beautiful blend of the two things.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, and then it becomes this artifact and, like, it\u2019s in your life and you - I mean, like, I watched the video you just posted recently about the about the  table that you made. And so, like, you know, the tables, people are going to come in, they\u2019ll see it. Like, you can tell him you made it. Like, there\u2019s a story around it. \n\nLike, you can \u2013 like, for the things that I make that are, like, in my environment, like, I\u2019m just constantly you know, looking at them. (Laughter.) And like, it doesn\u2019t bring back the full feeling that you get when you make it. But, like, I can remember a little bit of the good feeling that I had when I made it. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah, yes, yes, especially, there\u2019s some things that are, like, really good at this. I think, like, instruments are like this, furniture is like this, things that you use. It\u2019s actually funny, I talk a lot about how the biggest kindness that you could do if I make you something is like, beat the crap out of it - break it, because things are meant to be used.\n\nAnd, like, I built a sailboat earlier last year for a youth sailing program, and, like, there is no way that sailboat is ever going to look the way that it looks the day I delivered it. It\u2019s being sailed every day by, like, 12 year olds. (Laughter.) But that\u2019s the \u2013 that\u2019s what it should be. That\u2019s the way, like, homemade objects should be treated. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, what are you excited about in the future, like, either, you know, with the maker community, like, things you\u2019re excited about learning? Like, what \u2013 what\u2019s interesting? \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Ooh, that\u2019s a good question. I think the well, one of the things, like, very selfishly, one of the small things I\u2019m excited about is I have a new workshop. So, I just moved. And so, now I\u2019m kind of, like, nesting in my new space. I built a brand new workbench. I built - I\u2019m going to build a rolling clamp rack, so that I can take my clamps with me everywhere. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Nice.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: So, like, again, it\u2019s all these tiny, little things that kind of, like, feed your personal garden. But in the broader scheme of life, I think I\u2019m really excited to get to know that all of the new people coming into the community. And I think, like, it\u2019s the - the community is why we do a lot of this, in a way. It\u2019s like, I think I - the core of why I like to make things is because I used to just love making things for people as, like, gifts or - and getting to know people who have the same interests as you. \n\nAnd for a lot of \u201822, I had long COVID for a little while. So, I was, like, pretty recluse and a homebody. And now I\u2019m finally getting back out there, and I\u2019m, like, going to more events and meeting more people, and that\u2019s exciting. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s awesome. So, we\u2019re almost out of time, like, maybe two last questions for you. So, who is your favorite YouTuber? \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Ooh. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Or maybe you can\u2019t answer this, because you\u2019re a YouTuber, and, like, this will cheese, like, a bunch of new friends off.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: I\u2019m trying to think. Well, okay, so, like, my cousin has a dance YouTube channel. He\u2019s a dancer. So, I\u2019m like - you know, he\u2019s family and I love him a lot. So, that\u2019s my safe answer, is my cousin, because he\u2019s my cousin and I love him. \n\nAs far as, like, people I look up to, I don\u2019t know, I think everyone is different. There\u2019s like, the different veins of watching YouTube. Like, there are people outside of my space that I watch to get inspired in, like, music or in dance or in, like, a million other things. And then there\u2019s people in my space that I watch, because I enjoy their content, and also because they\u2019re running their business in a way that I admire a lot and want to replicate to some extent for myself.\n\nAnd then there are the favorite YouTubers in that, like, they are the people that when I was just getting started, were really nice to me and, like, kind of took me under their wing. And they didn\u2019t care that I had no subscribers. They just, like, were genuine and good people. But I think putting people into those boxes is a scary prospect. (Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I \u2013 I have all of these YouTubers \u2013 you\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re one of them. Like, I \u2013 like, I subscribe to you. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Oh, thank you.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, every time one of your videos pops up, I watch it. And then I\u2019ve got, like, all of these sort of topical channels that I watch. So, like, I\u2019m trying to figure out, like, slip casting right now. And so, like, they\u2019re just these, like, very topical people that I - you know, like, this guy, VanTiki, who, like, makes these incredible videos about slip casting tiki mugs. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Oh, my god, I love the, like, super specific channels like that. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And he\u2019s so good. Like, I don\u2019t understand how this guy doesn\u2019t have, like, a bazillion views on his videos. Like, they\u2019re so amazing, and, like, just such good, helpful content if you\u2019re trying to - like, I\u2019m not making tiki mugs, but, you know, like, I, it\u2019s the single most helpful thing I found in trying to figure out how to slip cast this sake flask I\u2019m intent on making. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Oh, my gosh, that\u2019s so cool. I feel like I\u2019m going to get off of this recording and start falling down the slip casting rabbit hole. (Laughter.) There\u2019s a part of me that keeps wanting to put a kiln in my backyard. Like, I really want a kiln for some reason, even though I\u2019ve never done ceramics. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Kilns are fun. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Kilns are fun. (Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, so maybe this is a question. How on god\u2019s earth, as expansive as your interests are and as limited as your space must be, how do you figure out what goes in the shop and what doesn\u2019t? Do you have a system?\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: I sort of have a system, but I - it\u2019s mostly chaos. I will say, this is not directly answering the question, but I think the answer is actually, you build a community of people who have all of the things in your interests. And I love going over to, like, other people\u2019s shops and learning from them at the thing that they\u2019re an expert in. This is, like, one of my favorite things to do. \n\nAnd I - I feel like I - everywhere I go, I kind of, like, adopt, like, an older neighbor who\u2019s got 50 years of woodworking experience or, you know, like, an older jewelry maker who\u2019s been doing this for a really long time. And - and then I just go over and use their stuff. And then it doesn\u2019t have to clutter my space, and I get to hang out with someone really cool and really interesting. So, that\u2019s more how I manage it. \n\nAnd then, like, my own shop is very woodworking and composites heavy, because that\u2019s kind of the thing that I do. In every video, I\u2019m either working with, like, carbon, fiberglass or wood. And so, I\u2019m sort of the person that people can come to when they need that. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: So, I think it\u2019s like a community cycle that we\u2019re all just giving and taking from each other. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and I really respect - I\u2019ve done a little bit with fiberglass, but never anything with carbon fiber. And so, like, I really respect \u2013 \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: You should give it a try. It\u2019s itchy, though. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter.) Yeah. I don\u2019t know, like, sometimes, like, I convince myself of things like that. Oh, it\u2019s going to be itchy. And then I don\u2019t do it, and then, you know - and then I try it, and it\u2019s not as bad as I thought. And then I\u2019m like, why did I wait so long? (Laughter.) \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah, yeah. I think, like, composites are really not as hard as people paint them out to be. And a pro tip is if you wear a nitrile glove under a work glove, then the dust will get into the work glove and kind of get stopped before the nitrile glove.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s smart.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: That helps a lot.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Because, like, I had everybody and their cousin when I first decided that I was going to do urushi lacquerware. They\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, no, like, you shouldn\u2019t do that. Like, it\u2019s - you\u2019re going to, like, break out,\u201d because, so for folks who don\u2019t know, like, urushi is this ancient Chinese and Japanese technique for making lacquered, you know, vessels. And it\u2019s a different sort of lacquer than what we\u2019re used to because, you know, it cures actually, only in humid environments, but, like, it cures \u2013 it\u2019s, like, unbelievable once it\u2019s cured.\n\nIt\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s water resistant. It\u2019s acid resistant, it\u2019s food safe. It\u2019s, like, all of these things. You know, there are lacquerware pieces that are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years old, you know. And, like, very, very often, like, they are, like, the substrate is wood. And so, like, it protects the wood underneath from rot for, like, you know, centuries.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Forever, yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But urushiol, the compound that\u2019s in this stuff, is the same compound that\u2019s in poison oak and poison ivy. And so, if you get it on you, and you are not one of the 10% of the population that\u2019s immune to contact dermatitis from urushiol, like, you\u2019re going to have a rash. (Laughter.) But, you know, like, you wear gloves and you\u2019ll be fine. (Laughter.) \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and that\u2019s, I feel like, that\u2019s the attitude you should have with all of these chemicals anyway. Like, you can develop sensitivities to epoxy, to wood, to carbon \u2013 like, all of this stuff. So, it\u2019s just, you have to do it right off the bat. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Cool. Well, this is probably a strange question for you, but I ask it for everyone that\u2019s on the podcast. So, outside of work, what do you do for fun? \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Oh, I do so many things. I actually - this is my top anti-burnout tip, is when you get burned out, or you\u2019re starting to get burned out, like, pick up a new hobby. And I kind of recommend hobbies that you kind of know you\u2019re going to be good at right off the bat. And that amount - like, putting in work and improving at something is such an important feeling to combat burnout. \n\nAnd so, I\u2019ve collected some very strange hobbies over the years. I\u2019m really - right now, I\u2019m really into climbing, rock climbing. I do a lot of salsa dancing, swing dancing, camping, going outside. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: You\u2019re a pilot.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: And then, oh yeah, I\u2019m a pilot. I have a Cessna 140 that I fly around, which for some reason, my brain kind of clumps into going outside, because it\u2019s always, like, out - adventures out to backcountry strips and stuff. But yeah \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, well, those are good hobbies, like super good.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, thank you so much for being on the podcast today, and thank you for doing what you do. I think you are an inspiration to tons of people. And like, certainly, what you\u2019re doing is getting folks to do more with their hands, and to be more creative and to feel confident that they can do things that they might otherwise not be confident that they can do, which is an awesome thing to do for the world. So, thank you for that. \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: Thank you so much. Thank you for having me. It was super lovely getting to know you. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Well, that was a fantastic conversation with Xyla Foxlin. So, there\u2019s so many things there. I think you nailed it at the beginning. She really is somebody who I think is, like, an inspiration for all of us, and so many people can learn things from her. But I was really struck by, I think, the fact that - and I really appreciated her being kind of honest about this, about the fact that other people around her saw her as an engineer before she even did.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And she\u2019s so clearly an engineer in everything that she does. But I really thought that it was cool to kind of hear about the fact that it was, like, her theater tech girls, who were the ones who were really kind of pushing her and seeing the things that everybody else, in my opinion, probably should have seen in her, and that, you know, I\u2019m glad that she was able to see in herself to get her to take that step and study engineering in college. \n\nHow important do you think it is for people, and not just, you know, girls and people of color, but I think for everyone, to have people who are willing to kind of see them and see what potential they have, even if we don\u2019t see it in ourselves?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think it\u2019s critical. You know, we talked about it a little bit in the show and like, honestly, this is the whole point of this podcast, right, is all of us are capable of something amazing. And it\u2019s so awful, I think, when we can\u2019t see those amazing things in ourselves, like, where the barrier to us, you know, doing something that we may potentially be great at that, like, everyone around us is going to benefit from. And is going to bring us personal joy, is because you just can\u2019t see yourself doing the thing.\n\nAnd it\u2019s one of the reasons why I love what she does, because, you know, on multiple different dimensions, like, she\u2019s trying to encourage people to do a bunch of these things that, you know, you may not think I can make a rocket, or I can make a piece of furniture, or I can make a sailboat, or I can - you know, like, all of the things that she has, you know, just relatively courageously decided that she\u2019s going to do, whether she, at the outset, knows exactly how to do it or not. \n\nLike, that\u2019s sort of how you get better at anything, is, like, you\u2019ve got to start trying somewhere. And like, I think she\u2019s just an incredible inspiration to get a whole bunch of people to start trying. \n\nAnd a big part of that, I think \u2013 she described this about her makerspace experience. Like, a lot of people, when they approach a thing that\u2019s different and new, that has a reputation for being hard and, like, sometimes, like, the reputation for a thing being hard has got, like, a gender or, you know, some other sort of stigma attached to it, the reality is, is, like, none of that stuff matters at all, like, in reality.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And just seeing her being able to overcome these obstacles, and, like, that\u2019s another thing I really admire about her is, like, she just - she doesn\u2019t show that everything is easy and, you know, magical. Like, she shows the hard stuff. And that\u2019s part of being a maker, is like, you make mistakes and like, things are difficult. And like, you have to, you know, try a bunch of times before you get something right. And, you know, just sort of even showing that I think is inspiring. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I completely agree. I think that we don\u2019t focus enough on it being okay to fail. I think so many of us are focused so much, you know, like she was when she was, you know, telling the anecdote about trying to do her first kind of project in college, and the grad student telling her, you know, \u201cWhy would you expect to be perfect at this when you\u2019ve never done this before?\u201d \n\nBut many of us, I think, have those expectations, that if we aren\u2019t just immediately doing something exactly as it should be done from the jump, then, you know, A, we\u2019ll never get better, or, B, it isn\u2019t worth trying. And it is, even if you\u2019re not successful ever. It\u2019s worth trying, it\u2019s worth learning from. \n\nI also think what\u2019s so great about what she does for other people as an inspiration is her sense of curiosity, which she mentioned. And she thinks, you know, said, like, curiosity is kind of, like, what she does as her career. And I feel that same way about a lot of the things that I do. \n\nAnd so, I love that, but that sort of thing is infectious. And that\u2019s the sort of thing, I think, when you see people who are curious and are willing to experiment with things, that\u2019s something that can spur on that same curiosity in others, which can then lead them to do really great things. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I could not agree more. I mean, and again, like, one of the things that I love about what she does is, like, she\u2019s encouraging people to indulge that curiosity. We\u2019re all curious and, like, way too frequently, you get pushed to suppress the curiosity, which is terrible. Like, just be curious. Like, indulge your curiosity. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I couldn\u2019t agree more. Indulge your curiosity, that should be, like, our - our motto for our podcast. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right. That is all the time that we have for today.
