{"episode": "Ep-47 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Sam Schillace", "text": "SAM SCHILLACE: Find the thing you feel kinda guilty about being paid for and do the hell out of it. Like if you feel kind of guilty that you\u2019re getting paid to do something it probably means you\u2019re really good at it, and it\u2019s fun for you, and if people are willing to pay for it, just go do the heck out of it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we\u2019re going to get behind the tech. We\u2019ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what\u2019s happening today. Stick around.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello, and welcome to Behind the Tech. I'm Christina Warren, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I'm Kevin Scott.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And today we have Sam Schillace with us, and he's somebody who was a huge part of the creation of Google Docs. And now he's working with you at Microsoft. Right, Kevin?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes, Sam and I have known each other for a very long time. So Google, many, many, many years ago, bought the startup that Sam and his co-founders started that created the first interactive web word processor, like back at a point in time where people thought that doing that was impossible. Yeah. And that work became Google Docs. And Sam ran all of the Google Apps business at Googl, for a while he went on and ran engineering and operations at Box, another startup until he went public, and was back at Google. And now he works here for us. At Microsoft.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: that's awesome. And we're really lucky to have him especially like all of his experience, and also like, thank you for bringing the word processor to the web browser. That's amazing. All right. So let's go ahead and let's dive into your conversation with Sam. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Sam Schillace works at Microsoft in the office of CTO as Deputy CTO and Corporate Vice President, focusing on consumer product culture and next generation productivity. Prior to Microsoft, Sam spent three tours at Google, Gdocs, Google Ventures, and then Maps and Search. Sam originally worked at Google as a founder of the Writely acquisition and led the teams that built Google Docs. He has a long history in consumer software as the focus area lead for consumer apps at Google and in multiple startups he\u2019s founded. He also worked at Box as head of engineering for four years, where he and I met on the technical advisory board. He holds a BS and MS in Theoretical Mathematics from the University of Michigan where he focused on combinatorics and discrete mathematics. Sam, it\u2019s great to have you on the show today.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: It\u2019s nice to be here, looking forward to it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, so we always start these podcast conversations by going all the way back to people\u2019s childhoods, and I\u2019m just super interested in how you first got interested in science and math and programming, and like just what lit the spark.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Yeah, it\u2019s kind of like, I\u2019m a little bit of a black sheep in my family, like my mom\u2019s an artist and my dad\u2019s a psychologist and a psych professor, and so like it\u2019s a little \u2013 it\u2019s always been a little bit of a mystery, like that was always the thing I\u2019ve liked, as long as I can remember. I still have this old microscope my mother bought me as a \u2013 or my parents bought me as a birthday present, when I think I was like, eight, you know? It was like the coolest thing ever, that I had this like cool microscope, and like, I was super, super into it, like always, and like I wanted to be a doctor when I was younger. I did a lot of like biology and stuff like that in high school and things like that. But when I was about 12, for reasons that I don\u2019t even really think I understood, even at the time, and certainly don\u2019t remember, I really got into doing computing and the computer at the time was the TRS-80, you know, model one, the \"Trash-80.\" I convinced my dad to by me one, this used one from somebody. It was like 600 bucks, I remember, which \u2013 you know, it was like the equivalent of like three grand or something today, like a huge amount of money. \n\nYou know, I don\u2019t know why he did it, really, but he did, and he bought it and like, I remember it being down in our basement, and I would like, you know, write BASIC on it, you know, out of the back of Dr. Dobbs, and you know, the pixels were 3x2. They weren\u2019t even square pixels. They were this chunky, little thing that you could do like really basic stuff on, and if you felt like, you know, not retyping your program, you\u2019d tape it out to a cassette tape, and you know, read it back in later, and all that crazy stuff.\n\nAnd a friend of mine had an Apple 2 that we played on, you know, and wrote video games. I was really \u2013 I liked pixels a lot, like I liked making pixels on the screen, so that kind of drove a lot of it\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Did your high school have computers? I mean, like this is in the \u201880s, right?\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: I graduated from high school in \u201884. My high school didn\u2019t really have computers or really have a computer program. I didn\u2019t really think of computers as anything other than a fun hobby, even most of the way through college. Like, it, college \u2013 the first exposure I really got to anything significant, other than just early things was like the nursing school, across the road from my dorm, had a basement full of Mac Classics that you could go write \u2013 you know, use, and I would go write my papers on them because they were awesome. Like I didn\u2019t have to like \u2013 you know, I was a terrible typist, and I never learned to type-touch, so \u2013 you know, to actually type the right way, so like,  that was great because I didn\u2019t have to like white out and backspace and retype all my papers. I\u2019d just go do them there. \n\nAnd I even remember, even then, like all of my \u2013 like friends and roommates and stuff, classmates, thought it was a weird thing to do, like why would you go type on a computer, like we\u2019ve got all these perfectly good typewriters, and I was like, no, this is way better. And that\u2019s where I sort of started getting into them, and then like they \u2013 I did a lot of like goofy, weird little side programming projects in college, like making, like sort of pseudo 3 \u2013 2-1/2-D landscapes that were randomly generated that I liked to look at, and crazy stuff like that.\n\nAnd then, you know, I took one class in \u2013 one CS class in college. It was like the Knuth algorithm class, you know, the first book. It was cool, but at the time I was really into math and really into science, and I thought I was premed, and I was doing like graduate math classes, so that Intro to Algorithms class was just super easy. It was like the only thing I ever got an A+ in, ever in college, and my math profs really looked down on it, and sort of discouraged me from doing computers because it\u2019s like \u2013 well, there\u2019s like math, and then there\u2019s applied math, and then there\u2019s engineering, and then there\u2019s whatever the hell those hairy computer guys are, you know, it\u2019s like the bottom of the bucket.\n\nSo I didn\u2019t really pursue it, like I didn\u2019t get a CS degree. I kept doing my math degree, got to the end of college, and my college roommate, who was one of the cofounders of Writely, ultimately, had dropped out to go do a company that was also a word processing company, called Ann Arbor Software, they got bought by this company called Ashton Tate, before Oracle killed them, and got moved \u2013 he got moved out to the Valley, and I didn\u2019t know what to do with this weird math degree, and I didn\u2019t want to be a doctor anymore, and so I just moved out to the Valley and started writing code with him.\n\nWe wrote a video game and then ultimately wound up starting six companies together, and just worked together for about 25 years, just fell into it, I mean, just absolutely fell into it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Going back a little bit. I\u2019m curious, like why math? \n\nSAM SCHILLACE: I don\u2019t know. Like, I liked math. I thought it was fun. I\u2019ve always been kind of an abstract thinker. I like math. I like the \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I like being able to kind of tinker and build stuff with your mind. I mean, that might be a \u2013 kind of a throughline of all of this, like software is always \u2013 you know, you and I are both makers, we really like to make stuff, and I always liked software because it was the most that you could \u2013 you know, the most direct connection between your mind and making something, right, like there\u2019s as little mediating that as possible.\n\nMath is kind of the same way, right, where like you can think really interesting crazy cool thoughts, but you can do it in this interesting structured way where you\u2019re not just bullshitting, like you\u2019re actually like \u2013 you know, like I did a bunch of stuff with like set theory and the completeness and correctness theorem and the omega number, and all this other, like \u2013 you know, the whole thing, probability, like \u2013 it\u2019s just wild stuff. It\u2019s like metaphysical and cosmological, but like it\u2019s grounded in some real rigor, which is just a really interesting way to think about the world, right, like just trying to be this amazing toolset for understanding stuff.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it is, it is an interesting thing, it\u2019s some mathematicians go off in a completely different direction, but like a lot of what you do in math\u2014and I don\u2019t think I really appreciated this enough when I was taking a lot of math in college\u2014is that it is teaching you, in a sense, like how to do abstraction really well.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Yeah, and decompose problems, and I \u2013 one of the I think there\u2019s very little that\u2019s sort of really directly valuable in the computer career from my math degree, although there are some \u2013 definitely some ways of kind of thinking about Venn problems and stuff, but the thing that\u2019s super useful about it is, it taught me to be alone in a room with a \u2013 an unsolved, you know, seemingly unsolvable or extremely difficult problem, and just you know, not having any excuses, just like work through it, right? Like, you know, and like one of the \u2013 like this \u2013 I had this class, at one point \u2013 like there\u2019s group theory which most people know, sort of like this abstract theory of algebra, and then there\u2019s semi-group theory, and semi-group theory, you start to take away some of the axioms like you don\u2019t have associativity or commutativity of the binary operator.\n\nAnd man, is that stuff hard. You look at these things, these theorems that you have to prove, and you\u2019re just like, that\u2019s obviously true, and there\u2019s like \u2013 but you\u2019ve got to prove it, and there\u2019s just like no place \u2013 you know, it\u2019s like a seamless wall. There\u2019s like no place to get any traction on it at all. And like, sitting in a room with those things, spending like eight, ten hours, on like \u2013 like a two-line proof, you know, is just like really good mental discipline of like, you know, well, there\u2019s a solution, you\u2019ve just got to dig away at it, and you\u2019ve got to break it down into smaller problems, and you\u2019ve got to, you know, figure out what you know is true, and like what you hope is true, and how you get to the things that \u2013 you know, like all that skill is super valuable, I think, in engineering.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I learned a similar set of lessons when I took Linear Algebra in college. So my Linear Algebra prof, it was a very theoretical course, and he \u2013 100% of your grade were two exams, a midterm and a final, and on the two exams, they were 10 true-and-false questions, and they were take-home exams, and you could spend as much time as you wanted doing them, and it was brutal. Like you would take those home and get to, oh, I\u2019m confident that this true or this is false was a massive amount of theorem proving.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Yeah, I remember doing one of these midterms like this, I think, for one of \u2013 like one of my Group Theory classes, where it was 12 problems like that, and I took it home over spring break, and I got one problem done a day, you know, like I literally, like I could grind through one of them every morning, and then I would go out on the beach, or whatever, wherever we were. Yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 I think that discipline is \u2013 you know, this is the nice thing about math, I think, is that it\u2019s very easy to fool yourself. You look at something and think you understand it, or you look at something and you think you know how to do it, but like, doing it is the proof, right? And math really teaches you that\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I also had a -  when I took combinatorics in grad school, I had a professor who would occasionally slip an unsolved problem into an exam, and what that teaches you is what to do when you are faced with a problem that is literally too hard for you or anyone else to go solve. Like, can you get anything out of it, just the process of making the attempt? And you know, the answer to that question is like obviously yes.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Well, yeah, I had one of those happen, by mistake once, in one of my advanced classes, where the prof would give one, two or three stars. One was like you really should be able to solve this, two is like advanced, three was unsolved. And he accidently mislabeled a three-star as a one star, and he had a very unhappy group of kids on Monday morning, who had spent the weekend banging their heads against this obvious problem that was unsolved, actually. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, so how did you go from being a theoretical mathematician to \u2013 I \u2013 I understand the impulse to go work on some of this software, but like why work on software in context of starting a bunch of companies?\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: I \u2013 you know, it \u2013 again, it was a little bit of this like kind of falling into it, and a little bit of networking, right, which is also one of the reasons why I try to like network outside of my particular group because I think networking is why we don\u2019t have good diversity in the tech industry. People network with people like them, and so you kind of have to force yourself to go, you know, break those networks, and I think it\u2019s an important part of increasing diversity. But like, you know, we were at Ashton-Tate. Ashton-Tate was where I got \u2013 we got hired into the \u2013 that Mac division of Ashton-Tate and they were in the process of being strangled to death by Oracle, basically, right?\n\nSo they were a database company that Oracle was crushing, so that job only lasted about a year-and-a-half, and about six months into it, it became very apparent that it wasn\u2019t going anywhere, and we were trying to figure out what to do next. And like, my friend and I, Steve Newman, we were just bored, and we wanted \u2013 like, we had \u2013 they had loaned us like a silicon graphics machine that we were playing around with the flight simulator on it, and so we were like bored dudes, and like we wanted to play games, and there weren\u2019t any really good games. \n\nLike Castle Wolfenstein was the game that was there at the time, and we just like, wanted a Twitch game, and so \u2013 like this is actually a pretty good, like set of learnings from this game. Like we built this thing called Spectre, and it was a very early multiplayer game. It wasn\u2019t even ethernet, it was over AppleTalk, so you could play against other people in real time, you know, in your LAN, like within the office, just a straight-up, like first-person shooter. You\u2019re driving around in a tank. It looks like this old game, Battlezone, and it like taught me a whole bunch of stuff. \n\nIt taught me about like really focusing on user need and user value. Like we knew what we wanted. We were the customer. We were iterating with ourselves. We wanted a Twitch game, we wanted it to feel really clean, we wanted it to be really straightforward, we wanted stuff to blow up a bunch. And so like we built that, which was really hard to do on the hardware of the time. It was super hard to do with the networking stuff we had to deal with, so like we learned a whole lot about like value in programming is in like confronting these like really annoying problems and getting them right, you know, because like \u2013 again, like we got a patent for how the rendering worked because the hardware was too slow to draw all the pixels, and so we had to like erase a bunch of them. There\u2019s all this kind of stuff like that.\n\nSo that taught \u2013 that taught me a whole bunch of stuff, and then that like wound up paying for like four years of my life, like we sold it to this company \u2013 or we licensed it to this company that just like published it for us, and that was like, you know, good money for me at \u2013 you know, as a kid, like kind of to live on, and then \u2013 you know, as Ashton-Tate fell apart, the group that had been part of that company went on to do another startup, which didn\u2019t really go anywhere, but Steve and I went with them and worked on that for that four-year period.\n\nAnd when that failed, we sort of took the pieces of that and, you know, the dotcom movement was starting, and so we turned that \u2013 the pieces of that company, which was like a personal information manager, but we had built, like a \u2013 a good cross-platform Mac and Windows app framework out of it. We took that and quickly pivoted into building internet tools, one of which we sold to Claris. So that, right there, is like three startups in a row. It was like bing, bing, bing, you know, like kind of by accident, but like \u2013 you know, again, like \u2013 in that era, I spent a lot of time like feeling bad that I was doing something fun for a living. Like I kept feeling guilty that \u2013 I had dropped out of being premed to go do this thing, and I literally spent like the first 10 years I was in Silicon Valley, thinking like computers were a fad, I needed to go back to med school and get a real job, like this is just kind of a goofy, stupid thing to do, like \u2013 and eventually, after about 10 years and several successes, I was like, well, I guess this is my life now.\n\nYou know, I\u2019ve got money in the bank, and this is kind of fun, and it seems to be continuing to develop, so I guess this is a career, let\u2019s go do this. And there\u2019s actually a lesson in there, that I tell people all the time, which is, I think we\u2019re really confused, mostly. We have this kind of Calvinistic ideal \u2013 idea in our heads, that like work is equivalent to suffering, right? You\u2019re not really working if you\u2019re not \u2013 if you don\u2019t hate it. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I actually think the place for people to be \u2013 this is the career advice I always give people is like, find the thing you feel kind of guilty about getting paid for and do the hell out of it, right?\n\nLike if you feel kind of guilty that you\u2019re getting paid to do something it probably means you\u2019re really good at it, and it\u2019s fun for you, and if people are willing to pay you for it, just go do the heck out of it. Like career growth usually comes from having impact, which usually comes from doing something you love with a lot of passion, like that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not that much more complicated than that \u2013 so that\u2019s how \u2013 I never started off with like I\u2019m going to go do a bunch of startups. I just was like, what\u2019s the next interesting thing I want to go work on? Let\u2019s just go do that with all this energy. \n\nI always liked working with my friend, so we just kept doing stuff, and we kept making money, and it kept being successful enough, so like why stop?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and I think you had another couple of pieces of interesting career advice in there as well, so I totally agree with what you just said. Like, I also agree that working with your friends, like whether they were your friends before you start something, or whether you like form bonds with folks, you know, when you join a company, and you start working with them, I think that\u2019s pretty important. Because, on most days, like even when you\u2019ve got a thing that, you know, you\u2019re passionate about, and you nominally enjoy, like there\u2019s just a bunch of hard stuff you\u2019ve got to go do to make anything worthwhile. And so you do want to be doing it with people whose company you enjoy, or \u2013 and where you feel like some degree of camaraderie with them, otherwise it\u2019s just \u2013 I mean, you and I do this now, right, like I don\u2019t want to sell the image that Microsoft is, you know, somehow perfect.\n\nLike we\u2019ve got hard things we work on all the time, and then the two of us, like you know, because we\u2019re friends, we will, you know, we will complain to one another, and you know, the thing that you try to do, I try to do, you know, I even do this in my \u2013 in my marriage \u2013 is like, you want to sort of be grumpy, out of phase with each other.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Yeah, right, yeah, that\u2019s right, you want to be complimented, all kinds of complementarity you want in these partnerships, right, that\u2019s definitely one of them. Skillsets is another one, right? Like you want a linear thinker and a nonlinear thinker, and then you want them to be like, you know, in creative tension with each other, basically, in a constructive way, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I mean the other, like the most interesting, like complementarity advice that I ever got is, I had a mentor years ago who told me to imagine a histogram that has five buckets, and on the extreme left of the histogram, the bucket is labeled \"idiot\" and on the far right end of the histogram, the bucket is labeled \"genius\" and in the middle is \"average\" and you can take everything that you do, and every skill that you possess and put it into one of those buckets. So like that\u2019s not the \u2013 you know, the breakthrough thing for me. Like the breakthrough thing was this mentor said, if you work really, really, really, really hard, you can move something over one or two positions on that histogram, which means that if you\u2019ve got a thing that you are an idiot at, like you probably \u2013\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: You might get to average, if you\u2019re lucky.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and every minute that you spend trying to get to average is a minute that you\u2019re not spending doing the thing that you\u2019re a genius at, and you know, like what you want to do with teams or partnerships or anything else, to your point, about \u2013 you know, nonlinear versus linear thinkers, is you want to \u2013 like, you try to do something together, you need a set of skills to go do the thing, so like how do you, like figure out this thing where everybody\u2019s histogram adds up to like above average, where you can have everybody focus on what they\u2019re really good at?\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Well, and the real challenge with this is that, you know, just to keep going with that example, like sometimes you know, if you\u2019ve got two geniuses that are pulling in different directions, they neutralize, and then you don\u2019t have either genius, and so like \u2013 and so, and like in fact, that often happens, right? Like this, I have this tension a lot with my cofounder, with Steve, like you know, when you have genuinely different perspectives on the world, and you are genuinely both good at them \u2013 those are often \u2013 you know, you\u2019re kind of blind to the other perspective to some degree.\n\nAnd so finding a way to like understand and respect the other perspective, even if you don\u2019t really get it, like you just understand, like this person, I don\u2019t get their domain, I don\u2019t even maybe necessary fully value it, but I understand that it is valuable and they\u2019re good at it, and so I\u2019m like deliberately \u2013 like carving out some space. I always tell founding teams, like pick somebody you like arguing with, like that\u2019s \u2013 you know, don\u2019t pick somebody you like. Like it\u2019s easy, you know, don\u2019t just go found something with a friend. Pick somebody that you enjoy arguing with, where like you have genuinely different perspectives where you\u2019re struggling to even find common vocabulary, but it\u2019s okay, like you\u2019re willing to have those arguments to kind of find that common ground in between your domain, because often there\u2019s like super small overlap in the Venn diagram of even like the language that they use, right? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Even going back to, you know, marriage, like my wife is smarter than I am, and like \u2013 a lot, and you know, there were a bunch of things when we first got together that both of us were \u2013 both of us were good at and both of us liked doing, and eventually we learned that, like we just sort of had to pick on bunch of these things, where I sort of had to say, like all right, this is going to be your thing, and like I\u2019m not going to try to get up in your business on this, and vice versa.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Yeah, everybody has comparative advantage and stuff, too. Like,  one of the things that drove me nuts in my marriage for a long time is \u2013 I have opinions about stuff and my wife doesn\u2019t, as much, right? Like I\u2019ll know what I want for dinner, and she won\u2019t, and whatever, and like we just sort of decide, like okay, like that\u2019s fine, like you know, we kind of get comfortable with those different modes, and like you take that role\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I think the thing that we\u2019re sort of getting at, the meta point, is like you just really have to be thoughtful about how you\u2019re trying to do things together with other people. You have to pay attention to what the dynamics are and try to make things work for everyone.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: And, and you have to recognize that that\u2019s not \u2013 like, if you\u2019re struggling with a coworker, or a team member, or whatever, like that\u2019s not an anomaly to be worked out. That is a fundamental requirement of high-functioning teams is that you\u2019re going to have tension between different perspectives, and that\u2019s like a fundamental critical value of being a mature team member and leader is that you\u2019re actively aware of this and managing it. Like you\u2019re never \u2013 there\u2019s no easy, like you know, if you snap a bunch of people together that are all the same person, that team will fail, right? There\u2019s always tension in these teams. There has to be if they\u2019re going to be high functioning. That is the fundamental skill.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and I think the thing for managers as well is realizing that you can realize all of what we just said and still be a victim to some of the stuff yourself, and which is why it\u2019s really important, if you are leading things to like have people in your network who can help you go deal through your own shortsightedness, where intellectually you should understand how to go deal with it, and yet, you just aren\u2019t because you\u2019re a human being.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: This is actually a really good illustration of one of my favorite things in tech, in general, is that favorite patterns that shows up in a bunch of different ways, which is this tension between long term and short term, right? The manifestation is, like, the tension between what I know I should do in the long term versus what I want to do right now. I always joke, it\u2019s like, well, I want to be on a diet, but there\u2019s a donut in front of me and I\u2019m eating that thing, you know? Like, that kind of the easy way to think about it. \n\nBut, like, here, right, you know what you should do. You know you should build and manage this thing in the long term, but it\u2019s, like, hard to do because what you want is a day-to-day life where you don\u2019t have to deal with tension among your team members. And so, you\u2019re kind of biased in this direction of picking the easy thing. \n\nAnd the thing you mentioned of, like, you know, reaching out to outside groups and stuff like that is a common solution to that. You have an externality. You pick something that\u2019s an external forcing function that makes the short-term kind of equivalently expensive in some way to the long term or reduces the cost of long term. So, you do the long-term thing.\n\nBut that \u2013 like, that pattern manifests in architecture. It manifests in development tooling. I mean, it manifests everywhere in the tech industry. I see it as, like, one of the fundamental challenges of doing what we do very well at scale. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah so going back to what, you know, we were talking about 10 minutes ago, just in terms of career advice, like, one of the other thing, nuggets that you had in there that is worth calling out is it is very important, I think, to choose to go work on things that are hard. Like, usually, the meaningful things, things that have impact, like, things that have lasting value were hard and, like, if they weren\u2019t hard, somebody else would have done them and the problem would be solved. But, like, you know, the \u2013 we have this, you know, hypothetical frontier that we\u2019re all, you know, as human beings trying to collectively push forward. And, like, getting the frontier pushed forward is just an inherently hard thing. \n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Right. Yeah, absolutely. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It pushes back against you. And so, the only way you make progress is just with the choices that you make. You have to choose to go work on hard things.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: You have to sit in discomfort all the time with this stuff. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Which is hard for engineers, right? Like, engineer, the engineering mentality, we like neatness. You know, people like things to \u2013 our job is to solve problems. And so, we don\u2019t like things to be unsolvable or to confront stuff where you don\u2019t know the solution or whatever. Like, one of the common mistakes people make is waiting for that moment where the thing seems obvious to do because it\u2019s, as you said, it\u2019s too late.\n\nLike, I always think the right time to work on a new problem is when you have this pit in your stomach where you just know that it\u2019s going to happen. But it also, like, you just know it\u2019s going to be hard and miserable to grind through it because it\u2019s so early. Like, you know, we can talk about this in the context of G Docs. \n\nLike, I always give this example in the early days of Writely, we\u2019re like, you know, I had this \u2013 I didn\u2019t really \u2013 I can\u2019t claim I had the whole idea for G Docs early on. What I mostly had was just me messing around with JavaScript and content editable in the browser because it seemed like a fun thing to play with, which is a lot of what we would do. But, you know, we had this idea of doing this word processor, and we kind of stood it on its feet and we cleaned up some of the early collaboration stuff so we could kind of work together without stepping on each other. \n\nAnd, you know, we had this sense \u2013 first of all, we had this sense that, like, this was cool, and it was going to be really hard to pull off. And you kind of had that sinking feeling in your pit of your stomach, like, oh man, is this going to hurt? But also, like, my two founders said, you know, \u201cThis is a dumb idea. We\u2019re not going to be able to build a word processor in a browser that\u2019s satisfying.\u201d \n\nAnd the funny thing is that they were right as well as being wrong, right? In the moment, they were right. The browser of the day, IE4 and early Firefox and all that stuff, like, there\u2019s no way, man. Like, they were really not ready. The JavaScript environments weren\u2019t ready. The DOMs were flaky. There were no standards. Like, in a zillion ways, we were not ready. \n\nBut the interesting thing was, like, if we solved enough of the problem, we confronted that hard stuff at that early stage and solved enough of it to demonstrate value to ourselves and to some other people. And that started a flywheel, right? And that flywheel between, like, the browser got better, the app got better, the users adopted it more, the browser got better. You know, we had these three pieces of this triangle started to spin and that dragged us forward to where we are now, where the browsers are super capable, the apps are super capable. Billions of people use these things.\n\nLike, you know, that\u2019s the \u2013 you know, 100% agree with you. Like, that is the thing you have to do is like you have to be able to see those vistas as they open up, and then you have to jump into them when they\u2019re nasty and hard to deal with.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I think it\u2019s a good thing to just sort of pause and think about. So, in 2022, as we have this conversation, people take for granted that, like, obviously, you\u2019re going to be able to have an interactive word processor with collaboration. And you can comment, and you can share it with anybody in the world, and, like, you\u2019ve got all of this stuff. When were you first doing this? It was 2002?\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Five, five, 2005.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Two-thousand five. So, like, in \u201805, like, nothing like it existed. \n\nSAM SCHILLACE: No.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, everything today that\u2019s in your life, whether it\u2019s a PC or a laptop that you\u2019re able to buy for not that much money, relatively speaking, that you\u2019ve got an Internet that\u2019s got all of this information on it. You\u2019ve got a device in your pocket that connects you to all of that. You have things, like the\u2026 Everything that we take for granted now was impossible at some point in the not-too-distant past.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Right. The iPhone didn\u2019t exist when we started doing this. Like, we were right before it, right? Like, you know, I don\u2019t know if AWS was a thing then, but I don\u2019t think it really was. Like, I think, like, LoudCloud was a thing back then, right? Like, it was sort of like, yeah, like, all of it had to happen somewhere, right? \n\nAnd I think Jobs had a quote about this, right? Like, he realized at some point, like, all the cool stuff in the world, like, somebody came up with it and that somebody could just be him. And so, that\u2019s why he came up with a bunch of stuff. You know, like, you know, like, he\u2019s Jobs, but, like, he\u2019s right. Like, everything gets done by someone somewhere. So, you know, if you don\u2019t confront these seemingly almost impossible things, then you don\u2019t get to be one of those people. I guess it\u2019s kind of the price of admission is you have to deal with it. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: I mean, the other lesson I take from that is, you know, and I tell people this all the time, like, I\u2019m you know, I\u2019m not that smart. Like, I didn\u2019t, you know, foresee the cloud or anything like that. Like, we were we were messing around with stuff, and we were listening to signal from the market and from users, right? \n\nAnd that\u2019s really the important thing, is, you know, this stuff in retrospect, 16 years later, looks super obvious, like, oh yeah, of course, collaborative documents and mobile and all this other stuff is obvious. But, like, it wasn\u2019t at the time. It was super controversial. And  there are a bunch of reasons why stuff like that is controversial. You know, it\u2019s not only that it\u2019s just hard to implement, but there are also, like, kind of natural psychological reasons that people push back on stuff, right? \n\nLike, you know, you also have to remember, like, in that era we were mostly on the desktop. The Internet was just kind of starting. And, you know, the idea was like, well, Microsoft has won this game. Like, Office is this giant thing with all these features, and they have this distribution channel, and software is just \u2013 software comes in boxes and that\u2019s just how it is. \n\nAnd so, like, this disruption of, like, we\u2019re going to distribute differently, we\u2019re going to focus on convenience instead of functionality, we\u2019re going to kind of go down this different path, like, it was super controversial to \u2013 challenging to a lot of people\u2019s worldview. And when you \u2013 when your worldview is challenged, you have this very stark binary choice that you have to make, which is I\u2019m wrong or it\u2019s wrong. Like, that\u2019s, you know, something \u2013 either I was wrong about the world or, like, the world is right or, you know, this thing is wrong. \n\nLike, and so, usually, people choose the thing, and humans are great at coming up with stories for why, whatever they want, right? Like, we all know this. So, like, if you want to think a thing is wrong, a new challenging thing that challenges your worldview, if you want to think something\u2019s wrong, 100%, you will find a reason why that thing is wrong.\n\nI told you that, like, my founder said, like, \u201cThe browser won\u2019t support it.\u201d That\u2019s a good example of that kind of story. But almost every new technology gets dismissed as a toy or impractical, or there\u2019s no use for it, or whatever. Like, and I always feel like, you know, the right place to put yourself is the what if, not the why not right? Like, you have to ask the question of what if. Like, when you confront this thing and you see a bunch of problems with it, you don\u2019t \u2013 why not is like, well, here\u2019s all the why not? Here\u2019s why it\u2019s not going to work, right? Here\u2019s the problems, all the problems I can see, the stories I can tell. \n\nBut the real thing to say is like, what if it works? What if, like, we transform software into being this zero install, on demand global thing where we can collaborate with people? What does that world look like? And if that world\u2019s compelling, then it\u2019s worth doing the effort to break through all the problems. And that\u2019s the much better mentality. \n\nBut you have to recognize that in the moment, you won\u2019t see the vision. Like, you won\u2019t see the prize even if you ask the what if questions. You\u2019ll maybe see some of it, but you just kind of have to, like, grind through these things and make them happen.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Yeah, you know, and it\u2019s sort of interesting. I mean, Bezos has said this a bunch of different times, and I suspect you and I have both experienced it over and over and over again, of people, other people telling you why it is the thing that you are \u2013 it isn\u2019t going to work. \n\nI mean, one of my favorite examples, and, you know, I won\u2019t name names, is when I first joined LinkedIn, right before LinkedIn IPO\u2019d, we had a whole bunch of work that we had to go do to make all of the company\u2019s development infrastructure better. Like, we had just gotten ourselves into a state where it was getting progressively harder to, you know, do the sorts of rapid software development that a consumer Internet company needed to be able to do. \n\nAnd I came in and, you know, there were a bunch of people inside of the company who knew what needed to be done before I got there, but there were also, like, a bunch of people who looked at what they were suggesting that we do. And they would be like, \u201cOh, this is impossible. Like, we\u2019ll never be able to pull it off. These three people who tried to do this before failed, and it was a miserable, embarrassing failure.\u201d \n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Right. That\u2019s my least favorite excuse. (Laughter.)\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, God, it\u2019s the worst.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: I\u2019m just like, just because you couldn\u2019t do it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t do it, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And so, the interesting thing, we did a whole bunch of things that I think are innovative and, like, some of them are now, you know, multi-$10 billion public companies that spun out of even what LinkedIn was doing. But, like, you know, the core of what we were doing, like, wasn\u2019t rocket science. Like, I had sort of done it a couple of other times in different contexts, and it was just a matter of will and determination, and, like, enough patience to get it all the way over the finish line. \n\nAnd I remember going into a meeting with a bunch of people and told them what the plan is. And the plan was uncomfortable because it meant you had to \u2013 we literally burned \u2013 we went over this bridge from old build and deployment infrastructure to new and burned the bridge behind us. We literally tore the old system down where there was this three- or four-week period in December of 2011, right after we\u2019d gone public, where we did not have the capability to deploy new software.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: (Laughter.) Yeah, that\u2019s pretty terrifying.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And so like, you know, I was telling people, you know, what this plan was and, like, why it was important to go do it and what we would get on the other side. And I had, you know, like, a senior person look at me and it\u2019s like, well, you better \u2013 you know, you better hope you\u2019re right. Like, it was this personal thing that I was doing. I was like, \u201cNo, no, no, I\u2019m not doing this for me. I\u2019m doing this for all of us. Like, we all need to hope that this is right.\u201d (Laughter.)\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. The proper response is, \u201cYou better, too, right?\u201d (Laughter.) We all better hope we\u2019re right. No, for sure.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But yeah, it is my least favorite thing, is, like, somebody telling you that a thing is impossible. \n\nSAM SCHILLACE: I mean, one of the lessons, the real lesson for me from the early days of Writely which was super valuable was this exact lesson of, like, don\u2019t listen to the naysayers very much, right? Like, and you get this, like, particularly really disruptive things. You know, when you \u2013 when you have a product idea and you get it to people, mostly what you get is, like, a bell curve of interest, right? Like, some people are kind of interested. They\u2019re sort of smeared along. It\u2019s not \u2013 like, there\u2019s not really high emotional valence anywhere. \n\nThe really interesting stuff I\u2019ve found has high emotional valence. You either get a small number of people who are totally on your side because they see the vision, and the rest of them want you to stop doing what you\u2019re doing immediately or have it die in a fire, or whatever. Like, they\u2019re violently opposed and there\u2019s very little in the middle. \n\nAnd we had that with Writely for, like, years. Like, after Google bought us, we were at Google. I had executives at Google tell me it was a bad idea, and they didn\u2019t want to fund it and that we should stop doing it. And I was like, \u201cI\u2019ve got millions of people already that think it\u2019s a great thing, and the company is moving over to it and, like, what are you talking?\u201d\n\nSo, like, fortunately, like, we had enough. Like, I was not \u2013 you know, I hadn\u2019t learned the lesson, but I had, you know, a contract that I had to fulfill, and I had backing of Eric Schmidt. And we had, like, a bunch of reasons why, you know, we kind of believed in it and kept going. And I didn\u2019t listen to the naysayers, but, like, that was a real privilege of, like, being given permission to not listen to the naysayers, and then realizing after the fact, like, holy crap. Like, I\u2019m really glad I didn\u2019t listen to them because that would have killed this thing. And it was critical to it coming into existence that I didn\u2019t listen to the naysayers.\n\nAnd that \u2013 like, that\u2019s a really deep lesson for me of, like, I\u2019m very comfortable being in conflict or, you know, in these kind of early, chaotic things, like, taking these controversial positions. If I have conviction, if I can see a path and I think the problems are solvable and I have a vision for where I think we might be going, like, it\u2019s fine if people object. Like, it\u2019s kind of a good signal. It actually is a good signal. Like, you want it. Like, you want controversy, you want it that energy.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and what\u2019s the worst that can happen if you fail?\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Right, right. Well, even failing, like, you know, the worst thing that can happen if you fail is you don\u2019t learn anything. Failing when you learn something is fun.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Or that you learn not to try again.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: You learn not to try again, yeah. Like, you know, like, you know, I\u2019ve you know, there\u2019s all kinds of things where I\u2019ve seen teams try stuff and they\u2019ll say, look, well, that didn\u2019t work and, you know, you can\u2019t do it again. I\u2019m like, no, actually you achieved part of it. You just didn\u2019t get it quite right. You didn\u2019t quite get the \u2013 you know, you didn\u2019t quite understand the market. You didn\u2019t quite understand the problem, but you made progress. Like, you got energy out of the system. Like, keep doing it; like, you know, you\u2019ll get there. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I was having this conversation with someone yesterday who was\u2026 who had just joined the advisory board for an energy company. And the particular energy company is doing something that\u2019s completely preposterous sounding, but it is a thing that if it\u2019s successful, like, we would all want it to exist. \n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Right, right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It would like, everybody would want it. And so, you know, the only question is like, is it a good use of time to go push this thing forward that everybody will want if someone can make it exist? And like, you know, this person I was chatting with is like, yeah, you know, it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know for sure or whether this is going to work, but I know they\u2019re going to make at least a little progress on it. And even if the person who solves it later, like, they\u2019re going to refer back to this and sort of say, like, hey, this was, like, you know, an important thing that helped me solve the eventual problem.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: There\u2019s a there\u2019s a book that I like by this guy named Steven Johnson. It\u2019s called Where Good Ideas Come From, I think is the title of it. And he talks about, like, the adjacent possible, right, and this principle that, like, it\u2019s very difficult to see more than, like, one step past the edge of what\u2019s known and possible currently. Like, not many people can see really two or three steps into the unknown. You kind of make these \u2013 these, you know, small \u2013 we move kind of in small incremental steps. \nAnd, like, sometimes, you get, like, kind of concurrent inventions of things when, you know, a bunch of different fields advance to within, you know, one \u2013 each of them is one step away from coming together on some new thing, like microwaves, I think, was the example he gave of, like, there are three or four inventions that, like, all of a sudden if you were in, like, one of three positions, you were one step away from figuring \u2013 putting these pieces together. \n\nSo, I think, like, that\u2019s \u2013 you know, it\u2019s important to make those, like, those steps forward. And, you know, you just \u2013 it\u2019s fine to not really quite know the solution to the problem, as long as you can have these kind of relatively short chains of problems that you think you can solve, or at least you know the vector that you need to solve along, right, because you\u2019ll get there eventually. Someone will get there eventually. Even if all you do is move one step. If it was three steps were needed, well, then the next person only needs to do two, right? And like \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Another really good book along those lines is Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s Profiles of the Future. And, like, this is the book where he articulated his three laws, like, one, everybody knows the third law, which is any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. \n\nBut the point that he was making in that book is that it\u2019s very hard with high precision for anybody, no matter how smart they are or how good they are as a futurist or a scientist or an engineer, to predict exactly what the future is going to be like in 20 or 30 years. And, you know, he had some practice with this because he was a science fiction writer in addition to being, like, a really quite a good engineer. \n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Right\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: His framework for looking at the future is, like, you know, don\u2019t try to make very specific predictions about the future. Like, make predictions about what the shape of any possible future must be, like, where the progress trend\u2019s going, like, what is going to have to be, like, a set of things that will be true in the future, and then sort of direct your effort, like, to your point, along those vectors. \n\nYeah, you could not have predicted when we were \u2013 you know, even when you and I were in college, that we were all going to be carrying a smartphone around in our pockets. Like, it\u2019s\u2026 I think of smartphones, right, are even, like, a little bit crazier than the, like, Tricorders from Star Trek.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Yeah, and, like, in that era, I remember the Cray-1 was, like, the hot computer. And I think that\u2019s about as powerful as, like, an iPhone 4 or something like that, you know. So, you know, like, even if you knew Moore\u2019s Law intimately and you like math and did the math, like, you still don\u2019t have a visceral feel for how much that\u2019s going to change the world, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, but you just named the trend. So, the trend is, like, you have these exponential progress curves on the price of compute, the density and the density of compute, the, like, energy density of batteries, like, the transmission in receiving bandwidth of wireless communication. And so, like, all of these things are sort of inflecting up. And so, if you look at all of that, like, you may not predict Android or the iPhone, but something\u2019s going to happen there. \n\nSAM SCHILLACE: One of my favorite things right now is the learning rate thing, right? Like, we understand there\u2019s about an 18% generational learning rate with solar panels and about a 6% generational learning rate with batteries. Every time you double the deployment, you get that percentage increase in efficiency. And, like, you know, it seems kind of funny, like, where did that come from? But if you look back, like, literally, like, 40 years, you can see it. \n\nAnd I was just talking to my wife yesterday about EVs, and we\u2019re looking at, like, buying an EV. And I remember when the Tesla came out, that was, like, six generations of batteries ago. Originally, like, the 300-mile range that everybody wants was really hard to achieve. And now, all of a sudden, like, every EV that\u2019s out there has a 300-mile range. And you\u2019re like, wow, like, did they all get smarter or whatever? Like, well, no, kind of they did. But, like, also, batteries just got way better because there\u2019s a baked-in learning rate. And so, you know.\n\nAnd you look at a lot of climate, like, alternative energy and climate change. Like, I still think people don\u2019t fully factor this in, that, like, solar is going to just keep getting better. And, you know, all these \u2013 wind has another \u2013 wind I think is 12%. You know, you can see the learning rates in a bunch of these technologies. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: So, like, you just \u2013 that trend is durable for a while.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and you get to the point where, at a certain level of scale, you \u2013 you just get much broader participation in an ecosystem than in the beginning. So, it was sort of an elite thing, you know, like, elite \u2013 elite engineering schools and, like, just a very small handful of companies could have even conceived of building something like the Tesla Roadster when, you know \u2013 like, when \u2013 when Tesla really started getting going. \n\nToday, like, you know, I was hanging out with someone the other day where, like, they\u2019ve got two classic cars they\u2019re converting into EVs right now. And like, you can buy all the components offline, the motors, the inverters, the power management systems, the \u2013 like, all the components in the car talk over this car area network that\u2019s standardized. Yeah, like, not everything is great, but it\u2019s almost like the early days of the PC ecosystem where you just sort of buy a bunch of stuff, build your own PC. Like, you can buy a bunch of stuff, build your own electric car.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Yeah, you can totally see this coming. I also like to talk about one of our favorite subjects, too. I think this is going to happen right now with AI. I think this is, like \u2013 I have the same sense, you know, I\u2019ll kind of pull all these threads together. Like, I have exactly the same sense of imminent disruption and that kind of uncomfortable pit in your stomach when you know something is going to happen and you have to do the heavy lifting engineering for it, about AI. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nSAM SCHILLACE: And I think, you know, we\u2019re \u2013 I think we\u2019re at the cusp of a fourth transformation, right? So, like, PC, the Internet and mobile were these three transformations where a lot of activity became suddenly accessible to computer programming, right? And I think that accessibility or legibility, however you want to describe it, is, like, the core thing, right? Once, like, an area of human activity becomes accessible to software in some way, you get these explosions of businesses and value. \n\nYou know, we got all the stuff that the Internet gave us and then the mobile let us take it out into the real world. And, like, every stage, like, the businesses got bigger, the value got bigger, got more ubiquitous. And I think AI is going to take this into the cognitive realm now. \n\nAll this stuff that\u2019s cognitive, like natural language, and object recognition, and video and just reasoning about the world is now becoming very accessible, not to programming in, like, the large scale, like, oh, we\u2019ve got these large models to do that. So, but programming in the sense of, like, I can give it to, like, a guy who\u2019s, like, the guy building or gal who\u2019s building the car, you know, and, like, they can snap pieces together and build interesting things out of it. And that, like, accessibility to folks and of these cognitive \u2013 like, I think that\u2019s going to be hugely transformative. \n\nAnd I suspect people listening to this, half of them are rejecting that out of hand. Like, it\u2019s \u2013 you know, here\u2019s the why not. Like, it\u2019s happened before. It\u2019s really hard. I don\u2019t like that. People, I don\u2019t want people to be out of jobs, like, all those reasons.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s too expensive. It\u2019s dangerous in these ways.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: But like, we\u2019ll solve them. Like, we\u2019ll solve those, and the what-if is amazing.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: We will, yeah. And \u2013 and that is the thing. I \u2013 I wrote an essay in\u2026 like, I published in the March issue of Daedalus, which is the Journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, where the framing that I was proposing for thinking about this stuff is just sort of cognitive work, and, like, thinking about AI as a set of tools that we\u2019re developing that will help us with our cognitive work, like, the same way\u2026\n\nAnd, like, we had a whole \u2013 in the Industrial Revolution, like, you had this big set of changes that were happening with physical work. And so, the practice arrived a little bit before the theory, but the theory came that you had thermodynamics. Like, you have very precise definitions of what physical work was. Then you had whole engineering practices that developed around it, and, you know, it is just ubiquitous in the industrialized world. Like, I think that\u2019s the kind of transformation that we\u2019re about to go through.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: And I think, like, similarly to that, like, you have \u2013 there\u2019s this process we need to start of, like, unlearning some stuff, right? Like, we had to unlearn what work meant and kind of relearn it for that process. And I think we\u2019ve spent 40 years convincing ourselves as computer technologists that we have to do a bunch of work for the computers. Like, we have to build a schema, and we have to put things in a form, and we have to, like, structure data in certain ways. \n\nAnd, like, it was true. We didn\u2019t have the tools for that, but now we do. And now, we understand how to deal with messier stuff. And we don\u2019t \u2013 like, we don\u2019t have to have forms. We have classifiers instead and we have things that have judgment, and we have things that can synthesize, synthesize.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well and there are even some more subtle things. So you, as a trained mathematician, and, like, both of us, as practicing computer scientists and engineers for, you know, a handful of decades, part of our job is, like, we wield these, like, big stacks of abstractions to go solve problems. \n\nAnd like, part of the reason that we need these stacks of abstractions is, like, you can only do so much with the brain that you\u2019re born with. \n\nSAM SCHILLACE: The brain yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And it\u2019s almost, like, the abstractions are a compression algorithm to allow you to, like, go approach problems and, like, you know, just sort of fit all of these tools inside of your head. \n\nSo, a lot of people, I think\u2026 So, you know, a lot of people, I think, think that mathematics itself is sort of this, like, universal thing, that it\u2019s like a necessity of the universe. And, you know, Ted Chiang, who wrote the short story that became the movie Arrival, I think, sort of pokes at this in a bunch of different ways. \n\nLike, you know, mathematics may be more about humans than it is about the universe. And when you have a tool like AI, that\u2019s a way to, a different way to do a whole bunch of cognitive abstraction, you can sort of get after a bunch of problems that we solved \u2013 used to solve with mathematics that you\u2019re now going to be able to solve in a different way. And, like, that will be uncomfortable.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Yeah, it\u2019s really interesting. Like, one of the most fascinating things about AI is less that it thinks like us and more that it doesn\u2019t, right? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Correct. \n\nSAM SCHILLACE: That\u2019s the interesting \u2013 like, it thinks as well as we do, but in a different way. That\u2019s fascinating, right? A lot of that, like, you know, the deep, deep dream stuff, you know that  just, like, blows your mind with some of these weird ways they\u2019ll produce images or just knowledge \u2013 it\u2019s just really interesting, like, what comes out of these, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and even what you said. Like, we\u2019ve got to get new vocabulary for talking about it because, like, in a sense, it doesn\u2019t really think at all. Like, when you say \u201cthink,\u201d you are thinking about what we\u2019re doing right now. You have a \u2013 you have this cognition that\u2019s running on your brain, and, like, it is a different qualitative thing than what a model does.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Well, it\u2019s  interesting. This is going to get too abstract and too deep for us to dive into, but, like, to some degree, like, our brain is a bunch of these networks, right, that kind of are strung together in a certain way. And what we\u2019re doing is making new ones external and also kind of folding them into the mix, right? So, it\u2019s\u2026 just defining what \u2018to think \u2018means is challenging all by itself, right? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Like, you know, we have this, to your point, very particular sense of what that combination of networks means, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And look, there\u2019s just a bunch of things that you\u2019re not going to be able to get a machine to do. I wrote about this in my book, and it started as a dinner conversation I was having with a \u2013 you know, with a bunch of people. Like, it\u2019s one of those weird dinners, like, it was Yuval Noah Harari who wrote Sapiens was there and, like, bunch of other people. And we were you know, we were talking about some of this stuff. \n\nAnd I made this assertion that I believed at the time that this group of people made me rethink, which is like, oh, I don\u2019t think that a machine will ever be able to compose and perform music in a way that gives me the same emotional response that, like, Murray Perahia gives me when he is performing Chopin\u2019s G minor ballad. And they were like, \u201cYeah, why do you believe?\u201d And like, they just sort of pushed back hard on the assertion.\n\nAnd, like, they probably were right. Like, you could build a system, I\u2019m guessing, that would produce music in a feedback loop, like you could sort of put a bunch of EKG probes on you and, like, you could probably have the system in a closed feedback loop give you the same, like, autonomic response, like, the \u2013 you know, the shivers up your spine or goosebumps. \n\nBut, like, that, to me, still is qualitatively different than, like, what I get when I listen to this performance because it\u2019s, like, this \u2013 this human composer from a different time who was, like, trying to communicate something to everyone else. And then this performer from another different generation and a set of experiences who takes this work and interprets it in a way that no other performer interprets it that produces this emotional response in me. \n\nAnd, like, part of the beauty of that is that, you know, it\u2019s this stacking of human connection that has nothing to do with \u2013 \n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Oh, of course. Like, of course, like, the definition of that is I want to stack a bunch of human connections up. Then you can\u2019t do that if there\u2019s no humans in the stack, right? Like, of course not, by that definition.\n\nOne of the things I really like, though, is somebody \u2013 I forget who gave this example. Someone who was talking to a bunch of students, and they said, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible to build a computer that\u2019s roughly the size and shape \u2013 roughly the size of a human brain with all the capabilities of the brain.\u201d And the students, you know, mostly said, \u201cNo.\u201d And then he said, \u201cWell, what did you use to come up with that definition? You used a computer that\u2019s roughly the size of the human brain with the capabilities of the human brain,\u201d right? So, it\u2019s like, there\u2019s a little bit of tautology in there of, like\u2026\n\nTo your point, though, it depends on, like, the definition. Like, I think you\u2019re right, like, there\u2019s\u2026 You can\u2019t replace humans by something that\u2019s not human definitionally, right, like, if part of the meaning and the emotion is about the human connection.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, and look, I think the single most important thing for people to get through their heads is, like, it is not necessarily a goal of the AI work, certainly not the goal of the AI work that we\u2019re doing or that I\u2019m doing, is to replace humans. So, you even look at something, like, GitHub Copilot. The reason that you build an AI that helps people turn natural language expressions of a thing that they want code to do into actual code is to help you, you know, be able to get to the more important parts of your job more quickly.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Right. We did get a very nasty letter early on in writing \u2013 doing Writely from the Medieval Scribes Guild, saying that we were replacing scribes by doing this word \u2013 newfangled word processor thing. I\u2019m kidding, but like, you know, of course, like, nobody cared, right? (Laughter.) Like, we had long since replaced them and we understand that people need to write their own stuff, and it\u2019s awesome, right? And it makes you better. Like, the tool makes you better as a person, makes lots more value in the world, which is what\u2019s going to happen with these tools, too, right? It makes everybody better.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It just unlocks creativity. It does a whole \u2013 it does the thing that all of these tools eventually do. And, like, the trick is just sort of managing the transition, I think.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: Right. Right, absolutely.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, we are at time. I could go on more.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: I knew we would not through any of our \u2013 all of our questions, man. Like, I knew it was going to be like this.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I do have one last question. So, I ask everyone on the podcast at the end, outside of their work, and most of the people we talk to, their work is a thing that they find fun. But, like, outside of the things that you get paid to do, like, what do you enjoy doing in your free time?\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: I do lots of different stuff. I like \u2013 I\u2019m kind of a maker as, you know, as you are. I got really into fountain pens for a while and making fountain pens. I got really into old time music \u2013 I play mandolin, bluegrass mandolin and Celtic mandolin and old-time mandolin. So, I go hang out with people. That\u2019s really been fun. I took a mandolin with me all over the world. It\u2019s a little travel mandolin. So, I played bluegrass on a stage in Tokyo, and played bluegrass with some folks in Sydney and played actual Irish music in Dublin. So, that\u2019s super fun. I mean, it\u2019s just it\u2019s all kind of connected to me. I like cooking, I like making stuff. I kind of like getting into the world and doing things. \n\nI have too many hobbies, actually. Like, I could answer that. I could spend an hour on that question. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I reject that assertion. I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anything \u2013 (laughter).\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: (Laughter.) You and I have that in common.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, there\u2019s no such thing as too many hobbies.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: But that\u2019s, yeah, you know, you got me going on leather working recently, so that\u2019s kind of\u2026I\u2019ve got a pile that I look at guiltily every once in a while. I think I should do something with that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, you should totally do something with that. (Laughter.) Cool. \n\nWell, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us today. This has been a great conversation, and I\u2019m happy to have you on the show.\n\nSAM SCHILLACE: A lot of fun, yeah. Yeah, super fun. I\u2019ve been \u2013 had been looking forward to it. So, it\u2019s great. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right, that was a super fascinating conversation with Sam Schillace. So one of the really interesting things you were talking about, you know, you're getting into AI, and one of the things that was said was like that, AI, what's so interesting about it is that it's not that it thinks like us, but that it doesn't, could you expand a little bit more about that?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, I mean, one of the things with AI, is, we're just seeing it more and more over the last handful of years is being an assistive tool, like a thing that helps us with the things that we're just not great at. And, you know, this has been sort of true with most of computing technology. You know, CPUs are better than human beings at arithmetic, like their computer algorithms are better at dealing with certain types of complexity than human brains are. And like, this is certainly true with AI. There are things about human creativity, and like intuition, and, you know, all of these things that we actually take for granted, that are very hard for AI systems to do. Whereas like, there are all of these things to do with complexity that AI is getting increasingly good at doing. And so the thing that I think we ought to be doing over the coming years is like just sort of leaning more and more into those differences than trying to, you know, build things that are exactly like a human brain, because like, basically, what we want to do is build these tools that can help us offload all of the repetitive, irritating cognitive things that we're doing. So we can go spend more time on the things that are uniquely human and special and rewarding and fulfilling.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, no, and you kind of you, you're mentioning, like you wrote a journal article, kind of to the same point, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yep. Yeah, I mean, so the journal article was, in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences did a special issue on AI and society. And my article was on a framework for thinking about AI as a tool for assisting us with cognitive work. You know, the same way that steam engines and you know, sort of mechanical devices in the 18th and 19th century were ways to, new ways to assist us with physical work for like, you know, picking heavy things up, for moving heavy things from one place to another for doing this sort of rigorous heavy mechanical work over and over and over and over again. It is, essentially AI is a new type of steam engine, and like we don't quite understand everything that it's doing yet the same way that we were inventing these machines before we had the physics of thermodynamics. Like we're slowly figuring out exactly what the science of cognitive work is and like how you measure it and how you sort of see whether you're making progress towards making it better and better and like you're building the right machines to go do it. But you know that that is I think the right framing for thinking about it. It's like, they're just tools like GitHub copilot, for instance, it's just, it's just a tool, like you know, instead of having to go look up a whole bunch of stuff, like you just sort of tell the machine like what you're trying to accomplish, right? Like it, it writes some code for you.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right, right. It's just a tool. I mean, that's why it's called the copilot. It's not, you know, the pilot, it's not doing it for you, it's assisting, you know, you're exactly right. One other one kind of final thing I wanted to touch on, you know, Sam kind of mentioned, like, he feels like we're on like, the cusp of like, kind of like this, this big fourth, kind of, like wave of advancement. And, and he can be, like, you know, it's sounds like he can just like taste like where we're going to be. Are you on the same wavelength with that?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: oh yeah, very, very much. I am more excited about where we are, and where we're likely to be over the next handful of years than at any point in my career as a programmer and computer scientist, and like, I'm 50 years old, I've been doing this for...I almost sound like my grandpa. Now, I've been doing this for almost 40 years. Now. Like I wrote my first program when I was 12. And, yeah, so like, I've lived the three big revolutions that we've had. So yeah, this transition from computers being scarce, right? Like how everybody has one. And I went from information being scarce, to you have the internet and information is no longer scarce. And, you know, you went from computing being, you know, sort of physically tethered to being like, physically ubiquitous, you know, your smartphone. And I think, you know, what we're about to have happen now with AI is like another transformation where the thing that's hard right now is technology is brittle. It is super challenging. To use still, like things crash, like user interfaces are complicated, like, you know why? You have to like, have five programs come together, or five apps to like, do the thing that you want to do. And I think very soon now we will have copilots for everything. Yeah, you will have AI that can just sort of listen to you and hear what it is that you're trying to accomplish, and then can do all of that management of complexity for you to get your thing done.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No. Yeah, I mean, I think it's exciting. And I mean, I think, you know, Sam had mentioned this to like when you think about just how, if you even think just just holistically like how quickly all of this has happened, and how much quickly you know, how much shorter distance there is kind of between these different waves? Like, I think that that's really exciting, too. So I'm glad that we have like people like we have people like you and Sam, who are thinking about these things, and are leading teams, and doing research and all this stuff. Because that gets me excited. Right. And I'm sure that it gets a lot of members of our audience excited as well.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it's a it's a good time to be in tech.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right.
