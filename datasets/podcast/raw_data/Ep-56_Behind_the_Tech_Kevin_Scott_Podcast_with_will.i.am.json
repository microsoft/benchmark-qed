I\u2019m in a freakin\u2019 rocket ship, and the lane is the sky. There\u2019s no lines up in that. Like, there\u2019s no frickin\u2019 lanes there it\u2019s like I can go anywhere.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we\u2019re going to get behind the tech. We\u2019ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what\u2019s happening today. Stick around.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello and welcome to Behind the Tech. I'm co-host Christina Warren, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: And I'm Kevin Scott.\n \nCHRISTINA WARREN: And our guest today is will.i.am. He is, of course, the founder and lead member of Black Eyed Peas, but he's also an entrepreneur, philanthropist, and producer.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I met Will relatively recently, even though he's been pretty involved in the tech community here in Silicon Valley for a while. And it was a really interesting first meeting because we met in the context of a gathering that was mostly about artificial intelligence, where the technology is and where it's headed. And my assumption was because he's an artist and he earns his living through writing songs, recording them, distributing them, like, you know, creating these performances that he would be, wary of where AI was going. And, you know, he was just super optimistic about where things were headed and like what, what AI could do for creatives, both in terms of like, their creativity and their economic opportunity if we make the right set of choices. And, you know, of course, he's, you know, also worried about some of the risks,\n \nCHRISTINA WARREN: Sure.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: which, which I think are obvious, but like it was just really interesting to, you know, in that conversation and hopefully that will be reflected in the, you know, in the interview that we're about to have. Just that optimism was really inspiring and encouraging.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, totally. I'm really looking forward to this conversation because, you know, as you said, he's an artist and I think a lot of people still think of him in those terms because of all the work he's done, but he has been involved in the tech industry for a long time. And I think that that offers some interesting perspectives. So I'm really looking forward to this conversation. Let's do it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: will.i.am is a singer, songwriter, actor, record producer and technology entrepreneur who\u2019s most well known as the founder and lead member of Black Eyed Peas. He\u2019s also an entrepreneur and the CEO of FYI, a Web 3.0 AI messenger. He invests in software and operating systems incorporating AI, natural language understanding and voice computing. He does a lot of work to encourage inner city, disadvantaged youth to apply themselves in STEAM fields so they can prepare themselves for an AI, autonomous, robotic and highly technical tomorrow. \n\nwill.i.am, thank you so much for joining me today.\n\nWILL.I.AM: Aw, thanks, Kev. It\u2019s good to be here. Sorry for calling you Kev. It\u2019s because we spent so much time at the Vatican. I feel like I\u2019ve known you since high school. So, I\u2019m like, yo, what up, Kev? (Laughter.)\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. No, Kev is great, I love it. (Laughter.) So the thing that I would love to start with is how you got interested in science and technology in the first place. Was it when you were a kid?\n\nWILL.I.AM: Yeah, I went to a school called Brentwood Science Magnet, and we were so fortunate and blessed to have Apple IIcs back in the \u201880s and had like oceanography class, physics, and advanced placement. I was trying my hardest to get into that, but I couldn\u2019t but computer, oceanography, physics, was \u2013 I was able to get into those classes, so, and that was first through sixth grade, and I loved computer lab, I loved Mr. Libwock\u2019s (phoenetic spelling) class and Miss Mullen\u2019s class in oceanography, so that was \u2013 that was my forte in that realm of STEM. At the time it was just magnet, you know, but if it was today, that would be a STEM school.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And who did you have encouraging you to do this stuff, like were your parents in technology-related professions? Was there anybody in your community? Like where did the \u2013 the motivation come from, or was it just entirely on you?\n\nWILL.I.AM: No, my mom, arts and crafts, was like, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s do arts and craft.\u201d That was like my mom\u2019s way of like keeping us, you know, focused and out of trouble, because I grew up in a pretty bad neighborhood, so arts and crafts was like, you know, sharpening up my creative skills, and then going to school, coming back with like, \u201cMa, I gotta make a volcano \u2026 Ma, I gotta make a frickin\u2019 solar system with this Styrofoam \u2026 Ma, I gotta \u2026 you know, I gotta do work, can you take me to the library to find another computer,\u201d but we could never do that, so I didn\u2019t really get good grades there, but \u2013 but, yeah, it was my mom and her brave, how brave she was to send me to school, two hours away from the ghetto, to and from, like a hour-and-a-half, away from the ghetto. That I was from.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so that was \u2013 this magnet school was first through sixth grade, and so \u2013 you know, where did the interest go from there?\n\nWILL.I.AM: So I had this teacher named Mr. Wright and this man changed my life, because I was hyperactive as a kid, and still as an adult. He put the seed to say, you know, your creativity, \u201cYou have a curious mind, you\u2019re super creative, focus on your creativity,\u201d and I thank Mr. Wright for that reminder of what my superpower could be if I was to focus on it.\n\nSo Mr. Wright and then Miss \u2013 Miss Montez (phonetic spelling) when I got into high school, so these two teachers really changed my life, you know, a nudge, acknowledgement, mentorship goes a long way, especially for kids that are coming from the inner city and going to, you know, the rich neighborhoods, that type of encouragement that \u201cI see you, I see your strengths,\u201d and that\u2019s when I realized that my currency, even though I was poor, my currency was my creativity, that is what separated me from, you know, my peers, was my imagination, my ability to materialize ideas.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I want to talk about that a little bit because this is one of the recurring themes in the folks that we talk to. So almost everyone who is successful in technology like has a little bit of that same creative impulse that I think recording artists have around creativity, and it feels to me like that creativity is this really interesting continuum. And I, you\u2019ve just done sort of extraordinary things that not having yourself pigeon-holed into, like, one creative thing.\n\nWas that a thing that came natural to you, because I think there\u2019s a lot of pressure to \u2013 you know, for folks to stay in their lanes.\n\nWILL.I.AM: Yeah, stay in your lane means that you\u2019re on a \u2013 in a car on a road. I\u2019m in a freakin\u2019 rocket ship, and the lane is the sky. There\u2019s no lines up in that. Like, there\u2019s no frickin\u2019 lanes. It\u2019s like I can go anywhere, when you, if you\u2019re a bird, if you\u2019re a spaceship, you can go anywhere, anywhere you want, and that \u2013 that go anywhere you want, with your imagination and creativity, that seed, again, that mentorship, that encouragement, Jimmy Iovine was that person for me.\n\nBefore Jimmy Iovine it was Eazy-E, so I had a record deal in the eleventh grade. I was signed to Eazy-E from NWA, and the record company was Ruthless Records, and even though I come from the inner city, a gang is right smack in the core of the neighborhood I was from. I dressed, you know, differently. I didn\u2019t dress in gang attire, and although I was assigned to a gangster record company, Eazy-E was like, \u201cYou\u2019re different. Don\u2019t change who you are for anybody,\u201d and so that type of like acknowledgement: \u201cI see you for who you are, your creativity is your authenticity, it\u2019s your badge, it\u2019s your badge of entry, it\u2019s your credentials, it\u2019s your visa.\u201d\n\nAnd then from Jimmy Iovine acknowledging that, like, \u201cYou got different ideas. I love your ideas,\u201d that\u2019s what gave me the fearlessness to, you know, make friends with people like Jim Balsillie at RIM. I would fly up to Waterloo and sit with Jim Balsillie and Mike when Blackberry was like the kings of mobility, mobile communication. Paul Jacobs at Qualcomm. These folks acknowledging my ideas early \u2013 in early 2000s, 2006, 7, 8, and then I met this guy by the name of Joe Sciarrotta at Ogilvy, so those five people, Eazy-E \u2013 how does Eazy-E and Paul Jacobs, what do they have to do with each other? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: will.i.am! (laughter)\n\nWILL.I.AM: Eazy-E, Jimmy Iovine, Paul Jacobs, Jim Balsillie and Joe Sciarotta, these cats are the ones that were, \u201cI acknowledge your creative contributions, because they\u2019re not just ideas, they\u2019re a materialization path. Here\u2019s a great idea, here\u2019s a way to execute it, and here\u2019s how it can impact \u2026\u201d \n\nSo that type of like, encouragement led me to create this thing called \u201cYes we Can\u201d song for the Obama administration that helped them get elected in 2008, that helped me come up with his concept, that I pitched this idea to Jim Balsillie once. I\u2019m like, \u201cHey, I know you got \u2013 I got a lot of songs in my hard drive that are \u2013 that will probably never come out, and I know you got the new Blackberry Torch, and I know you got some on the shelf that are incomplete, can you give me the guts, and I\u2019ll design, like artist phones. I need 600 of them, of incomplete phones, and I\u2019ll do new casings, and I\u2019ll bedazzle them, and I\u2019ll put you know, gold casings on them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gold casing is going to interfere with the antennas,\u201d and I was like, \u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll figure out a way to do that,\u201d and this is 2006, 2007. He gave me like 300 incomplete phones, and he was like, \u201cJust make sure you get a diamond one for my wife.\u201d And I was like, \u201cHey, I\u2019m gonna go get the music, the universal catalog, and let\u2019s start Blackberry Music, like Apple has iTunes,\u201d and so Jimmy Iovine gave me the catalog to take to Blackberry to create Blackberry Music.\n\nThe result is, it never happened, but still, I \u2013 it gave me the confidence, like I could meet these CEOs, I could have ideas, and I could materialize them, and that\u2019s what led to a program that I pitched to Muhtar Kent at Coca-Cola, called Ekocycle. I said, \u201cHey, Coca-Cola, companies as big as Coca-Cola should be verbs in society, if you don\u2019t believe me, Google it, and if Google is verb, Coca-Cola is a verb. It should be \u201cCoke\u201d in reverse, E K O C, for Ekocycle, Ekoconsumption, Ekocollaboration, Ekocommunity, and we\u2019re going to take your byproducts, your plastics, create a new base cloth and license them to other companies to execute their sustainability efforts.\n\nEkocycle Beats headphones was our first product, Ekocycle Levi jeans, and the very \u201cEkocycle,\u201d that is Coke\u2019s, verb, and so we launched that, and then from there, I got a job working at Intel, with Paul Antonelli, rest in peace, in the Futurist department, and nothing could hold me from that. I was a part of Beats from the beginning, pitched Jimmy an idea, like, \u201cHey, let\u2019s make our own hardware, and we could use our music to sell our own stuff, like why are we selling everybody else\u2019s stuff? Let\u2019s sell our own shit.\u201d\n\nAnd so Beats was started. I love contributing and being a partner, whether I\u2019m silent or vocal. In this case I was silent, but extremely vocal in the meetings. I helped navigate and we built a massive company and culture and community with Beats. Yeah, it\u2019s that, that fearlessness, but it starts with somebody acknowledging it and encouraging it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So how do you \u2013 I think fearlessness is like a really good word to focus on here because a lot of people who do creative things fail, and the fear of failure is like a thing that prevents them from really doing ambitious things, or even getting to the finish line on things that might be really good and successful. I just wonder how you have conquered that yourself and like advice that you\u2019ve got for other creative folks about how do you \u2013 you know, how do you be \u2013 and like if you\u2019re being ambitious enough, right, you are going to fail, like it \u2013 never failing is probably a sign that you\u2019re \u2013 you know, you\u2019re not trying as hard as you possibly could.\n\nWILL.I.AM: Yeah, so, failing, that shouldn\u2019t be your kryptonite, like for example, I fell down, you know, just playing on words. I fell down when I was as little kid, and I scarred here, and the scar tissue created like a little keloid. So let\u2019s say that the way that that healed is failure. It didn\u2019t stop the rest of my body from creating scabs and growing skin in the way to heal. My body is not afraid of failure. Even though I could see that, clearly, there, there\u2019s a little keloid there that probably didn\u2019t heal seamlessly. There\u2019s some scars that I have where I can\u2019t see the \u2013 how it recovered, but then there\u2019s some scars that I have where I can see that it probably didn\u2019t scar up right, heal right. I see the visible mark. \n\nSo what? Does that stop my body from trying to fix itself when I cut myself? No. So why shouldn\u2019t the same thing happen for my creative process? My body does a really good job telling me that it\u2019s doing what it does, regardless of failure, so why restrict myself and allow failure to be my kryptonite? Like, the folks that do that, we live in a world where, people are afraid to fail. That means you make no progress. That means you\u2019re sitting down somewhere, comfortable, doing nothing, right? Because you\u2019re afraid of what people might think. Your body is not afraid of what other organs might think, when it\u2019s \u2013 you know, going through trauma, based on your decisions that you put on your body.\n\nYou drink alcohol, you\u2019re missing your liver up. You think your liver is like, \u201cAw, I don\u2019t want the kidneys to know that I\u2019m \u2013 you know, I might fuck up,\u201d right? That\u2019s not \u2013 that\u2019s not how the body works, so why does your mind work that way? Why does your creative endeavors work that way? You should try to, you know, try to execute your aspirations and how you materialize your dreams the way natural systems do. Nature isn\u2019t afraid of failure. Your body\u2019s not afraid of failure, why are you?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, so what does your creative process like? So I, and I know, if you ask that question to a thousand different creators, you\u2019d get a thousand different answers, you know, like do you have a place that you go? Do you have music that you listen to? Do you, like have a routine that you exercise? Do you have people that you go talk to? All of the above? None of the above?\n\nWILL.I.AM: No, my creative process is like breathing. It\u2019s like, inhale, exhale, I don\u2019t even \u2013 sometimes I\u2019m thinking about breathing, and then once I start thinking about breathing, breathing becomes pretty boring. And the more that I allow creativity to be as natural as breathing, it\u2019s just life. \n\nI never have writer\u2019s block because there is no such thing as that. Either the shit isgood, or the shit is bad. It turns out, shit grows grass, so who gives a fuck? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That sounds like something my dad would say, like that\u2019s awesome.\n\nWILL.I.AM: Like, who cares? One day you\u2019re going to have some good stuff, and some days you\u2019re going to have some bad stuff. You\u2019ve just got to keep making stuff.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So to push on this a little bit, how do you decide what\u2019s good enough to present to other people? \n\nWILL.I.AM: That, that\u2019s when you start getting critical on your own stuff. If you can present something that you know is bad, you explain, \u201cHere\u2019s what I was going through when I made this, and I needed to let this out, because it\u2019s a reflection of what I was going through?\u201d Then there\u2019s no such thing as good or bad, because somebody might like that. Like, what\u2019s good or bad is relative.\n\nSomebody could say, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t like John Coltrane, that frequency of the saxophone and the brass really hurts my tinnitus, I can\u2019t deal with that \u2026 or it hurts my ears when I hear that.\u201d Or sometimes, people could be like, \u201cI really like the sound of the orchestra tuning, that\u2019s the most relaxing, calming experience, and I don\u2019t really like the songs there, but the tuning of the orchestra, oof, that really gets me, and after that I\u2019m gone, who cares what the orchestra is playing, I just wanted to hear the tuning.\u201d\n\nAnd I like the way the orchestra sounds tuning. It\u2019s like a meditational, like \u2013 they don\u2019t even know they\u2019re freakin\u2019 bringing peace to me. They\u2019re just tuning their instrument, and it\u2019s the most soothing sound that you could ever hear, people getting in order, people getting ready for perfection. It sounds beautiful when they do it together.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so how important is performance to what you do? \n\nWILL.I.AM: Performance is expression. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s therapeutic, it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t like to rehearse. Rehearsing is like, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to mess up,\u201d and then it\u2019s not fun, but if we just go out there and wing it and improv, we\u2019re going to discover some stuff, and if I mess up, that\u2019s just funny. \n\nAnd so the audience is having fun, because you\u2019re having fun, and the audience is mesmerized with \u2013 about the fearlessness of like, \u201cHey, let\u2019s just have \u2026 let\u2019s just go figure it out.\u201d That\u2019s what I love the most is to be thrown into a situation and have to improv, because I\u2019m not thinking anymore, I\u2019m just breathing, the adrenaline is doing \u2013 is my energy, my dodging from obstacles is the art.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome, so let\u2019s switch a little bit to technology. So you\u2019ve been thinking about artificial intelligence for a while, along with a whole bunch of other technology things. You have this company now, called FYI, that is doing some super interesting stuff, like what interested you in the first place about AI, and like, why go start a company, using these tools to, you know, do what you\u2019re doing?\n\nWILL.I.AM: There\u2019s a professor by the name of Professor Patrick Winston, at MIT, and I got introduced to him by a guy, by the name of Alan Hartstone, and in 2004, 2005, I was in Boston and Alan Hartstone took me to the Media Lab at MIT, and then he introduced me to his favorite professor who was Professor Patrick Winston. And Professor Patrick Winston was like this amazing, magnetic personality, and he led the AI lab there, at MIT.\n\nAnd he was like, \u201cHey, any time you\u2019re in Boston, you can always take my class,\u201d and even though I liked other parts of the Media Lab, that offering, of like, \u201cHey, whenever you\u2019re here, come check it out,\u201d and so every time I would go to MIT, I would go sit in Professor Patrick Winston\u2019s class, from 2005, 6, 7, 8, 9, even if it was like once a quarter. I would go and hang out with him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the guy that got me into AI, just the idea of what the computer would be capable of, and I\u2019m a musician because of the computer. I\u2019m not a musician because I play like John Legend. I\u2019m not a musician because I sing like John Legend, or I dance like Michael Jackson, or play the guitar and every, single instrument like Prince. I\u2019m a musician because, at one point in time \u2013 I say at one point in time because I saw some shit. I saw some shit that just blew my brain, in a good way. At one point in time I \u2013 my ideas, to get them out into the world required me to sit at a computer and program the computer to make music, and the computer is my instrument. And then sitting with Professor Patrick Winston, and I told him that, and he was like, \u201cHey, what instrument do you play?\u201d I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t really play an instrument, I play the computer.\u201d\n\nAnd he was like, \u201cWhat do you mean by that,\u201d and I was like, \u201cI make music on computers, and computers only. I mean, I used to make music on tape, like with reel-to-reels and splicing tape, and telling the band, like, \u2018No, make the play a little tighter,\u2019 making loops on tape, but then computer became more efficient.\u201d\n\nAnd so he was like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s interesting, you know, computers \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 what do you think about, what do you know about Ray Kurzweil?\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, Ray Kurzweil, you mean the guy that \u2013 wait, the frickin\u2019 synthesizers??\u201d\n\nSo then I studied on Ray Kurzweil, and like, you know, this Ray Kurzweil guy is frickin\u2019 amazing, and then the vision that he had, way back then, of the computer being able to make music on its own, is what got me to, like really dive into AI. And so in 2010, I \u2013 there\u2019s a video out there by Black Eyed Peas in 2010, in the beginning of a video called, \u201cImma Be Rocking That Body,\u201d I said, \u201cHey, this is what\u2019s going to take Black Eye Peas into the future, this machine right here, you type in lyrics and the machine will sing and make the beats and do everything. This machine, right here, in 2010,\u201d and kind of similar to what I saw last month, and I saw the most amazing piece of technology when I heard the best song I\u2019ve ever written and recorded, that I never recorded or wrote, and it coughed it up in less than a couple of minutes, like a minute.\n\nAnd it was pretty accurate to my writing process, my quirkiness, my style, and it made me realize, like, \u201cOh, shit, a new industry needs to be created.\u201d It\u2019s like in the music industry, there\u2019s three industries.\n\nYou have the recording industry, the publishing industry and the touring industry. This fourth one is now about to emerge, and I hope a fourth industry is created because of the technology, because if the record industry is the governor of it, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to be good for artists. If the publishing industry is governing it, I don\u2019t know. Because the artists should own their immortal creative thumbprint. That should be their  \u2013 and there needs to be an industry and a banking of your i-data-ty, that\u2019s yours.\n\nBut \u2013 and so thank you Professor Patrick Winston, wherever you are, in the universe, spiritually, energetically, thank you for inspiring me to go down this path of AI. I\u2019ve invested in AI companies, I\u2019ve built a couple of solutions, back in 2013, around natural language understanding, natural language processing and machine learning. I\u2019ve put teams together, acquired teams, put teams together. Right when we sold Beats to HTC, that\u2019s what I did with my money, was to go out and put teams together.\n\nWe did some pretty cool things back in 2014, with a product called A.N.I.T.A. It would say things like, you know, \u201cPlay Beyonce. What\u2019s going on with her? Does she have any shows coming up? Can you find sushi restaurants there? Can you book a table for me and five people,\u201d all starting with Beyonce, so it knows that Beyonce is her, and her \u2013 the show, the show, where, where, there, and there being a subset of the location of the concert, and then go off the app and make a phone call on behalf of you and the five people that are, not only going to the concert but going to the sushi restaurant.\n\nWe did a lot of that in 2014. To our failure, didn\u2019t know how to commercialize that, but that didn\u2019t stop me from trying and trying, and trying again. \n\nAnd you know, Silicon Valley and tech tell you, \u201cFail fast,\u201d but if you\u2019re from the projects, you don\u2019t \u2013 you cannot \u2013 you don\u2019t understand what \u201cfail fast\u201d means because you\u2019ve been failing your whole life, financially. Your circumstances have put you in a situation to where you didn\u2019t fail purposely, you just, your configuration put you in a failure mark, so failing slow and learning and growing and like having the tenacity to fucking just do it is where I come from, and I learned from that experience with the solutions that we built. \n\nWe then ended up selling a lot of the stuff that we did to Vonage, so that \u2013 that failure turned into some success, but I love AI.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s, that\u2019s super \u2013 I mean, like you may be the first person I\u2019ve ever heard say, \u201cFail slow and learn a lot,\u201d and like maybe that\u2019s an interesting new mantra for folks.\n\nWILL.I.AM: Well, as long as you\u2019re not burning money. The reason why they say, \u201cfail fast,\u201d is so you don\u2019t burn through money. But fail slow, you know, you went through elementary, junior high school, high school, and the whole process is failing while \u2013 while advancing. Sometimes you get Ds, sometimes you get Fs, some students, not every student is an A student, but from my experience, it turns out that a lot of the kids that were failing are hiring the folks that were freakin\u2019 getting As.\n\nSo what does that mean? Like, there\u2019s folks that work for me that I went to school with. I got Fs and Ds, but I excelled in an area that the school district didn\u2019t really \u2013 they didn\u2019t really support the music, and music actually is as a business, as an industry.\n\nRihanna is not just a musician. She is a freakin\u2019 entrepreneur. Ask LVMH. Dr. Dre isn\u2019t just a musician and producer. He is an entrepreneur. Ask Apple, three billion dollars later. Musicians are not just, they sell other people\u2019s products, and when they realize the stunt, they\u2019re now competing directly with the folks that have no relationship with the audience. They have no relationship with attention, so I learned that it\u2019s okay to fail, it\u2019s okay. You should not be embarrassed that you got it wrong, because you got it right, so why beat yourself up because you\u2019re still going to \u2013 you still know. There\u2019s folks that got it right that aren\u2019t making money. There\u2019s people that got it wrong that are caking up, \u201cYeah, bitch, I failed, but guess what? I\u2019m balling!\u201d It\u2019s okay, as long as you learn from the failure, and at FYI, I realized that creatives were working off of five different products. We have a Dropbox and a WeTransfer, and we\u2019re working off of Messenger, because you can\u2019t send large files on Messenger, so you have to use WeTransfer through mail, but even those big files, you have to move off a phone to a laptop, and then get massive Wi-Fi. Your conversations are in comments and in email and on text threads.\n\nYour IP and your copyrights are vulnerable and compromised because you\u2019re across five different products. So, I was like, let me create FYI for Focus Your Ideas, and have a central place for creative enterprise, right, the managing of the creative process with AI. \n\nSo, we have generative AI at the core of the product. It\u2019s your messenger, your digital asset manager, your strategic partner, and a place for your team to engage with AI, collectively, not like AI here, like, I was doing some shit here, and I copy and paste it here. Like, no, everyone and \u2013 on the same thread with AI, chiming, bantering back and forth with AI to strategize and improve on creative flow, strategic flow for the projects that you\u2019re passionate about. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, I want to talk a little bit more about this and about something that you said a few minutes ago, because I think with generative AI and, you know, maybe AI more broadly, there\u2019s this continuum of hope and expectation that people have. \n\nSo, on one end of the spectrum, people are really worried that these AI tools will disempower folks like creators and artists, that it will, you know, somehow or another, demean their work or, you know, change their ability to earn a living from their creative output and creative efforts. And on the other end of the spectrum, you have folks who think that generative AI is an incredible new tool that it can be, you know, a partner to help unlock your creativity that can, you know, help you make things that weren\u2019t possible before as an artist and creator. \n\nAnd maybe even thinking about it as a continuum is, like, the wrong thing. Maybe it\u2019s not an either/or. But like, it seems like you and I\u2019ve had a couple of conversations about this. And you\u2019ve got a very strong point of view here. And like, I\u2019d just love to hear you talk about that.\n\nWILL.I.AM: Yeah, so imagine this is 1970, and you\u2019re a drummer from a band that\u2019s pretty popular. And you\u2019re a drummer that\u2019s coming up, and you have aspirations as a drummer. And then, like, there was a drum machine, but you weren\u2019t really threatened by the drum machine, because it sounded like (doot-doot-doot). It didn\u2019t really sound like drums. And then the \u201880s come around and the LINN-900, and it started sounding a little bit more realistic, but it was, like, stiff and robotic. And then Prince really, like, made some pretty awesome songs with the LINN-900. \n\nAnd then the Akai MPC60 drum machine came, and you could sample live drums, and put the swing on it, and it kind of sounds realistic. And then 2000 comes around, you\u2019re like, yo, fuck these drum machines, bro. Like, all the songs on the radio are fucking drum machines. \n\nIn the \u201870s, it was all human beings, tight, and you have to be super precise. And the drum machine ate up a lot of the freaking, like, drum time for - for drummers on the radio. And since then, live drums on the radio and on streaming, you don\u2019t hear no live drums anywhere on the radio. \n\nBut what happened was the drummer, a lot of them became the producer, because they were like, you know what, if this is the case, I\u2019m going to learn this machine and I\u2019m going to produce the role of the drummer. They made more money. They \u2013 because the drummer never got publishing anyways, because how can you what\u2019s the publishing on drums, right? \n\nSo, the drummer in the band always got the shitty end of the stick when it came to ownership of the song, because how - what part did you write? I wrote this: (drum sounds). Everybody says (drum sounds). No, I said (different drum sounds). Yep, everybody says (different drum sounds). So, when it came to the how everyone participated, the drummer was always, you know, last, and that sucks. But the drum machine and producing on computers really empowered the drummer. \n\nThe same is for music, the whole entire package now, not just drums. It\u2019s guitars, it\u2019s bass lines, it\u2019s freaking chord progressions, ensembles, like, orchestral. Everything of music is now going through what the drummer went through in the \u201870s to the 2000\u2019s.\n\nNow the guy with the idea, the girl with the idea, the person with the idea, now they don\u2019t need the whole entire studio. They don\u2019t need a whole entire band. They just need their idea, and the machine will supercharge them. The way the drum machine and the print \u2013 and the DAW supercharged the drummer. That\u2019s the optimistic point of it all. \n\nThen there\u2019s, like, a bunch of negative stuff that I don\u2019t even want to entertain, because I think what we should be doing with AI is not just to augment yesterday. Yes, it\u2019s going to, you know, render how we used to do things kind of obsolete or create new ways of doing things that undermine, like, how we used to get paid. There\u2019s going to be new ways that we get paid. \n\nA song is going to be a lot deeper right now. But MTV said, \u201cHey, no, don\u2019t just write the song. Do a video.\u201d That video used to be just promotion if you wanted to go and sing in a \u2013 you know, you\u2019re from LA, but you want to tour all of America. Other locations were like, well, send me like a demo of what your show is going to be and I could put you on TV. So, they would do that promo clip that MTV hijacked and said, \u201cThese are videos.\u201d \n\nThose are promo clips. That was never a part of what a record contract was to be. And a record contract was based on the limitation of lacquer. And even though we had technology, like mini discs and CDs, that there were no more limitations, music is still composed as if there were limited space on a disk. A song is three minutes and 33 seconds, an album is 12 songs on it just because of the RPMs 33 that it went around the record. And the tempos of every pop song was limited. \n\nSo, even with, you know, with this advanced technology that we have, it\u2019s still basing it on limited. So, that means you have to reimagine what a song is, just like they reimagined what a song was from the 1800\u2019s when it was just theater and opera. When it came to the recording industry, they\u2019re like, okay, okay, we\u2019ve got to change to a different song format here. \n\nYou know, \u201cMuddy Waters, that song is too long. I need you to shorten it,\u201d because when they would sing the blues, they would sing - there was no time limit. They would just go to a bar. You hear somebody sing, and they sung for fucking hours. A song is like a reduction of the song sequence because of a limitation of the technology. \n\nSo, that means with AI and AI music, somebody has to reimagine what the fuck a song is. It\u2019s a discussion. It\u2019s a place for you to put your memories, a place for the song to alter, based on your mood. Like, \u201cI Gotta Feeling\u201d is not just for \u2013 what\u2019s the version of \u201cI Gotta Feeling\u201d when you\u2019re pissed? I just wrote the one that you\u2019re - when you\u2019re optimistic. \u201cWhere Is the Love?\u201d is like when something goes wrong. What about when something is right?\n\nLike, and then there are song like \u201cBoom Boom Pow\u201d that are about nothing. Hey, what\u2019s \u201cBoom Boom Pow\u201d about? I don\u2019t know, nothing. Like, it\u2019s describing the song. (Laughter.) This song is promoting the song that I wrote. What song? This one, right here, that I\u2019m singing (laughter) which is a crazy concept of songwriting. Like, what are you going to write about? I don\u2019t really know, though. I\u2019m going to write about this song I\u2019m writing. (Laughter.)\n\nBut you have to change \u2013 it\u2019s an opportunity to reimagine what a song is, to reimagine what it means in your life, to reimagine what it means to the world with percussion and bass. And I think we need to, like, inspire the creative community to use AI, not just for entertainment, but to reimagine the world. \n\nTomorrow\u2019s industries are what? Tomorrow\u2019s jobs are what? If AI is going to replace jobs, it\u2019s going to create new jobs. So, shouldn\u2019t the creative community also be tasked to, like, imagine what tomorrow is with it? Are we just going to freaking pretend that we\u2019re going to make songs forever? No, that ain\u2019t the case. You ain\u2019t going to be making songs forever for business, like we used to. You\u2019re going to be making experiences with it. You\u2019re going to be scoring moments and different ways of scoring moments, but it isn\u2019t going to look anything like yesterday. No. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, that\u2019s a super-compelling vision. So, we\u2019re running out of time here, and I want to ask you one last thing. Like, one of the most inspiring things that I think you do is how you are giving back to kids in historically disadvantaged communities, and, like, trying to help them get a leg up. Like, it\u2019s just really amazing work, and I\u2019d love to understand, like, why you decided to do that and, like, why you decided to focus on STEAM education for these kids.\n\nWILL.I.AM: Yeah. So, it was 2005. Somebody was like, \u201cHey, what do you want to do for your birthday?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh man, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to party. I think I want to go out to Indonesia. Did you see that tsunami that just happened there? I think I want to go out there and play a role to helping folks, you know, recover from that.\u201d \n\nSo, I flew out to Indonesia to Banda Aceh with UNICEF to do tsunami relief. What I did for my birthday, March 15th, 2005. And while I was there, I was like, wait, there\u2019s a tsunami every day in my neighborhood, a tsunami of neglect, a tsunami of police brutality, a tsunami of, you know, no opportunity, low investment on their education, a tsunami of, like, fueling an industry that they don\u2019t even know they\u2019re fueling, and that is correctional facilities. \n\nYou know, just follow the investment. Wherever there\u2019s a kid that\u2019s getting $5,000 a year for their education, they\u2019re subject to going in and out of juvenile hall, and then ending up in some privately owned prison. And that\u2019s messed up. \n\nAnd so, when I saw that in 2005 as I was out there doing tsunami relief. And I said, you know, I need to go back to my neighborhood. And so, in 2008, I started the i.am/Angel Foundation after I did Yes, We Can to help get Obama elected. I then had the honors of sitting next to General Colin Powell. I said, \u201cHey,\u201d you know, \u201cnow that Obama was elected, what is a person like me, what do you think I should do to keep the momentum?\u201d He was like, \u201cIf I were you, Will, I would focus on the neighborhood that you come from. You\u2019re not going to get anything to stop you from helping out in your community.\u201d\n\nSo, I went back to my neighborhood. I started a program in partnership with Laurene Powell Jobs. I asked her if she could bring her College Track to the neighborhood. And she was like, you know, \u201cWe\u2019re only in the Bay Area. We never intended on leaving the Bay Area. But if you want to do it, it\u2019s going to \u2013 it\u2019s a $10 million commitment.\u201d And at that point in time, I didn\u2019t have that much money to, like, commit $10 million if I raise it or not. So, I was like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019ll do it. What\u2019s the worst that's going to happen? I try it, it doesn\u2019t work out, and then have to figure out how to stop the program.\u201d \n\nSo, I signed up, even though I was facing a potential fail. And I said, \u201cHey, but I just don\u2019t want to send kids from the inner city to college so they graduate with debt and a diploma. That\u2019s the worst thing for inner city kids. So, I want to surround the program with computer science and robotics. So, that way, when they graduate, there\u2019s jobs waiting for them, and they have the ability to create new jobs.\u201d That was my gut in 2008. \n\nThat turned out to be so successful that that my program is the highest performing program out of all of Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 College Tracks. So, the I.am/Angel \u2013 so, the i.am. College Track in Boyle Heights outperforms all the College Tracks, because of the combination of college prep, science, technology, engineering, mathematics. \n\nIt started with 65 kids. Now, in 2023, we serve about 14,000 students in LA. We\u2019re in over 300 schools across LAUSD, because I believe when I - for me to get the education these kids are getting in the neighborhood, I had to drive an hour and a half out of my neighborhood. So, what does that do? That tells you that, man, I can\u2019t wait to make some money so I can leave my neighborhood. And everybody flees these neighborhoods.\n\nBrooklyn, people fled Brooklyn. Then it gets gentrified. So, as people want to leave, new people come in and change the neighborhood. Then they can\u2019t even recognize the neighborhood they grew up in; they can\u2019t afford it. But if you educate people in the community where they are and it\u2019s equal investment, like it is in Brentwood and Palisades, where they\u2019re getting $10,000 for their education, $8,000-$10,000 versus, you know, $3,000-$6,000 in the hood, these kids learn to love their neighborhood, and will aspire to change the neighborhood themselves, because they have the skills to change the neighborhood themselves. \n\nIt\u2019s going to get changed anyway. We see gentrification happening all around America, all around the world. Why can\u2019t it happen from the inside? Why does it have to - why does it have to happen the other way, where, like, some folks that are affluent have the ability to be like, yo, I\u2019m going to move to the bad neighborhood. Why? Because it\u2019s cool. And then they feel like they\u2019re freaking live in it because they\u2019re in the cool spots, like Brooklyn, because rappers rapped about Brooklyn, Compton, Boyle Heights, Inwood. And then they come and change it. \n\nWhy can\u2019t the people from the neighborhood change it? Why can\u2019t they freaking like\u2026 and the way they change it is by having the skillsets to do it themselves, solve the problems themselves, not waiting for, you know, humans who actually failed. \n\nYou talk about underdeveloped communities, underserved communities. That\u2019s failure because it\u2019s underserved and underdeveloped. And when you think of underserved and underdeveloped, no one ever points out the server or the developer. These people are invisible. They\u2019re just a title called underdeveloped and underserved. There\u2019s a person that\u2019s responsible for that, underserving and underdeveloping. It\u2019s called zoning, it\u2019s called laws. There\u2019s people, namesof folks that are responsible for South Bronx being South Bronx, Watts being Watts, not the people that live there, the people that zone it, the people that have laws and regulations, right? \n\nI can\u2019t go and open up a liquor store in freaking Palisades and Beverly Hills, and be like, yo, let\u2019s go to Beverly Hills. I\u2019m going to open up a liquor store right next to a check cashing place, and a strip club right here. Let\u2019s buy this up. Guess what? They\u2019re not going to allow me to do that shit, because it\u2019s not zoned for that. But why is it zoned in the hood? \n\nSo, that is the cocktail for underdeveloped. That\u2019s the cocktail for underserved because you\u2019re serving them some bullshit, bad food, no financial literacy. So, they get money \u2013 they get the check, cash the check, not build, and save and grow wealth, and then buy bad food, get sick. That\u2019s not - that\u2019s by design. \n\nAnd so, going to the neighborhood, showing folks, like, hey, here\u2019s a skillset, a skillset that has been opened up that we all need in society. The suburbs need it, the hood needs it, America needs, right? America needs it fast. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, America does need it fast. You are the most optimistic entrepreneur I know. And so, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing. And, like, you \u2013 you know, you\u2019re certainly changing the world in really positive ways. So, thank you for that. \n\nWILL.I.AM: Thanks, Kev. And, you know, a lot of people, they say, like, you know, \u201cWhy are you so optimistic about AI? It\u2019s going to mess things up.\u201d And then I always respond, \u201cWell people in the hood, their lives have already been messed up. And humans never came, the powers that be never came to un-mess it up for them.\u201d There\u2019s people in slums, people in favelas, people in provinces, their lives are already been destroyed. And maybe this time, this is their calvary. This is their solution for them to be able to wrap themselves around these skills to solve their problems that the powers that be have ignored the whole way through their whole lives, generations. \n\nAnd so, although there\u2019s concerns, those concerns are valid, and the concerns need regulations and governance. For example, I\u2019ve created artificial intelligence solutions, and that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s been awesome that - to work in this field. But I remember taking my written test to drive an automobile. I remember taking my physical test to have my driver\u2019s license, my California driver\u2019s license. I never had to take no test to create AI, no written tests, no physical test. \n\nThat is an issue, that anyone could just get some \u2013 right? That shouldn\u2019t be. I\u2019ve made some money. I can go out and buy a fast car, I can go out and do what I \u2013 you know, try to get a car that\u2019s not regulated in America to get, you know, registered and legal to be driven, like a Koenigsegg to be driving around LA. I could do that. \n\nBut I can\u2019t go out and get a freaking fighter jet and fly to New York because I want to. There\u2019s regulations to keep people from doing that, but not for AI. \n\nAnd as a person that\u2019s working in the field that loves the field, there\u2019s some things that I think we need to address soon. And I understand, like, don\u2019t regulate it to where it stifles innovation. No, that shouldn\u2019t be, but there\u2019s a balance between easy access and making sure that the folks that are working in it are doing it for the betterment of humanity. That\u2019s the \u2013 at least, can we do that one? At least, can we make sure that we\u2019re vetting folks that are working in the field, and there\u2019s some type of, like, eyeballs that wackos ain\u2019t doing wacko shit with models? We\u2019re not doing that one. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, that \u2013 that does seem like a very reasonable thing, Will. (Laughter.)\n\nWILL.I.AM: You know what I\u2019m saying? (Laughter.) I don\u2019t know. That - that\u2019s the only one. That\u2019s the \u2013 that\u2019s the one that I\u2026 I\u2019m playing in this field and working with awesome developers, and creating solutions. And our business practice at FYI is, like, your data is yours. Here\u2019s some - here\u2019s an encryption key for your data. \n\nYou know, NFT\u2019s and blockchain told us that a JPEG comes with a key. But for some reason, I\u2019m on these chat platforms that are encrypted, but I don\u2019t have a key to my account, to my data? We changed that with FYI. Here\u2019s a key. Here\u2019s a key for all your data. What\u2019s yours is yours. \n\nAnd yeah, we\u2019re really proud of our business model. We\u2019re proud of the product that we have. It\u2019s live; it\u2019s officially live. We launched it on May 4th, and then we\u2019re going to grow from here. \n\nI remember, like, they said, \u201cWhy messenger? Why did you choose a messenger?\u201d And I said \u2013 I remember, I was in the interview. And I said \u2013 they asked me, \u201cWhy STEM?\u201d Why do I focus on STEM? And I said, \u201cImagine of WhatsApp came from Watts, and it was called WattsApp. And the developers were from the community. Watts would have been changed forever. \n\nAnd so, I\u2019m from Boyle Heights. And I escaped the neighborhood because I focused my ideas, and I had a crew of people that had similar ideas. And I thought, well, let me - how can I do that for everybody, and help them focus their ideas? So, FYI is focus your ideas, focus your intents with AI. And it came from a creative for creatives that come from the hood. \n\nAnd we have - there\u2019s no tech company like that. And I\u2019m proud of the folks that have joined it. We just hired some amazing folks that have come from the likes of Uber, and Amazon and Apple, because they see the vision that we have. And, you know, lo and behold, just like any hurdle, our hurdle now is like, VC\u2019s say, \u201cWell, get some traction first.\u201d And that\u2019s the hurdle. And we\u2019re going to get \u2013 we\u2019re going to leap that hurdle, because I see their skepticism. \n\nLike, you\u2019re a musician. You\u2019re the founder, CEO of the company. But that\u2019s cool, because I think this gravity, this crunch is the gravity and crunch that I need. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with proving people wrong. I\u2019ve done it in my career in the past. \n\nAnd, like, there\u2019s no way Black Eyed Peas are going to make money for a record company the way, you know, Celine Dion or Michael Jackson or, you know, the obvious ones. And we ended up doing that, but we did that by strategically aligning ourselves with people that understood the pathway to do that. So, Jonathan Levine at Paradigm, Sam Gores. We strategically brought people into the fold to help us through the terrain. And we\u2019re doing that an FYI, right? \n\nSo, VCs, loud and clear, got you. We\u2019ll get traction, cool. But the creative community has been ignored. We build everybody else\u2019s platforms and never participate in the success of the platforms that we help build. So, we have great folks in our cap table from the creative community who have ownership in what we\u2019re building. And this will go down as, like, a product that was made for creatives by creatives, because it turns out in the world that we\u2019re about to walk into, everyone is going to be creative.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s a really awesome vision. So, everybody should go check out FYI, get the word out. Check it out yourself. Tell everybody you know. Like, we just desperately need companies like yours to get visible. Like, we want people to use it because it\u2019s awesome. But, like, just get yourself aware of \u2013 \n\nWILL.I.AM: Or people to use it to help make it awesome. You know, that\u2019s a thing, like, constructive criticism to help us chisel and improve, because we \u2013 you know, when they say AI for good, that means there\u2019s a lot of AI for bad. Like, go into the supermarket and be like, yo, excuse me, where\u2019s the organic oranges? That means there\u2019s a lot of fucking fake shit. There\u2019s a lot of freaking processed shit in the supermarket to have, like, a section called \u201corganic.\u201d\n\nSo, but at the time, when there\u2019s companies that have business practices that are for people, it turns out the gravity and the crunch on them is harder than the folks that are doing AI for bad. That\u2019s the part that\u2019s like, because a lot of times, bad undermines people\u2019s civil liberties, undermines people\u2019s privacy, and there\u2019s shit tons of money to be made while you, you know, data rape folks. And they don\u2019t see the benefit or the reason why you should invest in something that\u2019s for the people, by the people. It\u2019s not going to make crazy money, like, these frequent data rapers. But it\u2019s going to make human delight, empowerment. \n\nAnd we\u2019re going to \u2013 some things, we\u2019ll get wrong and a lot of things will get right by the help of the people to guide us, to be a part of our journey, but it\u2019s that Jedi moment, you know? They always -  people always use Terminator, like, yo, AI, man, it\u2019s going to take over. I\u2019m like, why are you going to that movie only? Why don\u2019t you go to freaking Star Wars? In Star Wars, there were multiple freaking AIs, multiple robots. Terminator is just one robot. So, we need to make sure that there\u2019s other people playing in the space, not just one company. \n\nThe Terminator idea, why is it - why did it go that way? Because there\u2019s one company, one product, one model that fucks shit up. The Star Wars idea, there\u2019s C3PO. That motherfucker didn\u2019t even speak English. This motherfucker is like (makes noise), and everybody knew what the fuck RTD2 was talking about. Then you got to C3PO, this motherfucker\u2019s arms aren\u2019t even fucking bent right. (Laughter.) And that\u2019s so many different bucket technologies in this fucking film.\n\nBut one thing they have in Star Wars that they don\u2019t have in Terminator is a fucking Jedi. And a Jedi and a fucking \u2013 the Siths and the Empire, they\u2019re all fighting with the same tool, a lightsaber. Nobody ever questioned who made that fucking product? That product at one point in time was designed. They tried to raise money for it, and some VC was like, I don\u2019t know, you\u2019ve got to get freaking traction. Who\u2019s going to fucking buy a lightsaber? \n\nFact is, there\u2019s a bunch of shit in that movie, technology riddled throughout the whole entire film. But then there\u2019s this fight for human fucking freedom, this human spiritual bond amongst freedom fighters and against the Empire. And it\u2019s a beautiful \u2013 I like that story with AI and robotics. That\u2019s more what the truth looks like than the Terminator one. \n\nThe Terminator one, we need to ensure that there\u2019s more people playing to give you your C3POs, your R2D2s, and all the other robots, and bots and AIs that are in it. The beam projector, they\u2019re all companies, they\u2019re all products versus the Terminator, which is one product. And if Terminator is the Terminator, which company made it? Which company is responsible for that, that we know today? If we\u2019re going to use movies to determine where we\u2019re going, as a metaphor, what\u2019s at risk? I think it\u2019s more like Star Wars.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I agree with you. And the important thing is to just make sure that more folks and more companies like yours have access to the technology they need to go make amazing things and to solve the problems they think are important.\n\nWILL.I.AM: Yeah, we\u2019re not doing \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Not one company.\n\nWILL.I.AM: Yeah, and we\u2019re not \u2013 and we\u2019re not \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, no one company can figure it all out. \n\nWILL.I.AM: Yeah, and we\u2019re not going to do C3PO\u2019s no bending elbows. That\u2019s not our product. (Laughter.)\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Don\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t do that. (Laughter.)\n\nWILL.I.AM: Yeah, yeah. Okay, cool. Thank you so much, Kevin Scott.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: All right, man. Great \u2013 great chatting with you.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right, what a fantastic conversation with will.i.am. All right, so I did wanna talk to you a little bit about this, and you mentioned this at the top of the show, when you first met him, you were struck by his optimism about AI, especially for artists. I was struck by that too, but what I was actually really struck by beyond just kind of the optimism for what the potential might be, I really thought that the way that he framed what the potential of new careers, that creatives might be able to get in this AI world was really, really compelling. His analogy, talking about how studio drummers then became producers, that is exactly right on. We've seen something similar in the tech space where people who were known as IT pros then become DevOps engineers or they become SREs. And you see how just because a new form of technology has come in, that doesn't mean that the people who had those old roles disappear entirely. \n\nIt's instead, I think, kind of an opportunity for them to take on a new role that couldn't in many ways be more lucrative. So I wanted to hear kind of your thoughts on that as somebody who, you know, I know you think a lot about AI, but you come at this a lot from the technology perspective. Talking to someone like him, who's obviously also very involved with creatives, did that have you thinking about anything differently or does that give you any hope for how we might work this out?\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, I think it certainly gives me more hope. And I love the drummer analogy because when these technologies enter fields, they are very complicated things. It's sort of difficult, I think, to predict exactly how they're going to be used and how they're going to reshape things like labor markets,\n \nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: for instance. And like we've just seen even with the doomsayers about, who predicted that AI was gonna wreak economic havoc on the labor markets and have been making these predictions for the past decade or more, like they've almost all been wrong. And so like the predictions can be wrong in both directions, both pessimistic and optimistic. And like the reality is usually more complex and interesting than the prognostications. And so I love hearing these analogies like the drum machine one. I mean, the thing that I will say is like the, this notion that there's no such thing as stasis in jobs is a thing that gets impressed upon you very early in your journey as a computer scientist or software engineer or programmer because everything has just changed so much over the past few decades. So I've been, I'm 51 now. I've been, like, I think I earned my first dollar from writing a program 40 years ago now,\n \nCHRISTINA WARREN: Wow.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: which is depressing to say out loud. But the difference between that first program and the program that, programs that people are writing right now are just like remarkable. Like it's\n \nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: almost unrecognizable, the activity. And so like the jobs have changed, the tools you use have changed. Um, you know, and even when I was a computer science, uh, teacher at university, um, you know, 20 years ago now, um, you know, it was a real challenge as a computer science professor to keep up with the rate of change when you're trying to educate kids. And so like, I think it's easy for us in the technology industry to assume that the rate of change for us is high and that it is not as high elsewhere, but I think sometimes that's a myth. Like\n \nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: everybody's job is changing all the time.\n \nCHRISTINA WARREN: Always, always, no, I mean, I think that's exactly true. That's actually kind of what I was thinking is that in tech, we do tend to kind of expect and think that things are changing and we don't necessarily, because maybe we're in our own bubble or whatever else, don't realize that other industries are that way too. Some maybe take longer than others and are more staid for longer periods of time. But if I even look at, you know, with both of my parents' careers where my mom worked in education and my father in real estate development, and just thinking about how much those industries changed over the course of their careers. You know, it might be slower, but it is still one of those things you're not going to ever have that, I guess, stasis, to your point.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And like even, even what you did in your past life, you were a professional journalist for a while. And I'm guessing when you started doing that job, it was probably before social media and like just things like social.\n \nCHRISTINA WARREN: It was right when it happened. And ironically, I joined then right because it was that change that was happening. And I knew that that was my in. And that was my ability to get in to what was then a boom. It's now since fallen off a little bit. But I got into the digital media boom literally as it started. And that was very specific and intentional on my part because I knew I had a feeling that that was the moment that there was now a chance to actually enter and have a career which was different, which I think actually right now is interesting for people coming in to art and creativity through AI, right?\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: A hundred percent. So like the thing that you just said and Will said it as well. And this is a thing that I've believed my, you know, my entire life is. Folks who are well attuned to what is happening in the technological landscape and like what, what those technological changes mean for, you know, the structure of industry and whatnot, like they will be able to realize such amazing opportunities to enter professions that are changing or to have jobs and professions that don't even exist right now. The thing with AI is the rate of change is very fast. We have new types of jobs now. We're recording this in May of 2023. There are jobs that are... being posted right now for AI for things like prompt engineer that literally didn't exist last fall, like no one knew what a prompt engineer was.\n \nCHRISTINA WARREN: Exactly! Six months ago, we literally did not have - in November of 2022 this was not a thing and now yeah, there are job postings and people leaning into this. It's incredible.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And so it, it doesn't mean that it's not disconcerting or disruptive or whatnot, but like, you know, I think the advice that I would give to everyone listening to this podcast and the thing that they should probably go, uh, you know, share with their communities is, you know, just pay attention to what's going on. Like the opportunities I'm highly confident will be there, uh, and they will be interesting and amazing opportunities, uh, for folks who are you're willing to lean into, you know, what's changing.\n \nCHRISTINA WARREN: I completely agree. I mean, and that is actually to me, it was always been one of the most interesting things about will.i.am is that very early on, with kind of at the peak of the Black Eyed Peas\u2019 success, he was willing to lean in and start experimenting in other ventures and in other ways. Far before, and this was before streaming had a profound impact on publishing and on record sales, right? And yet he was very early on to look into other ways of spreading both his creativity around and frankly his making money too. And I think that, yeah, exactly like you said, don't be afraid of leaning into or exploring something new and taking those opportunities because when I see what's happening in AI right now, I tell a lot of young computer science students or people who are new entering into the world, like, it's hard to keep up with everything that's happening, but this is a really important time and a really exciting time where you can really get in and kind of create careers for yourselves that you might not have been able to do not just six months ago but even a couple of years ago that can pay very long dividends many years into the future.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And, you know, there's also moments like the one that we're in right now are for people who have really big visions and like they sort of see the way things are and they wish that things were different. Like these are the moments where you actually have a window of opportunity to go make things different. And like, I think it was really interesting the thing that Will was saying about AI and music. So, you know, there are three industries now recording industry, publishing industry and touring industry. And like, maybe this is a way to like have a fourth industry and like, maybe it's an industry that, you know, gives artists more control than they've had, which is a thing that I think artists, you know, since I've been alive has been a thing that they've struggled with and advocated for.\n \nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I mean, it's been something that I think through the history of recorded music has there's been the tension there. And wouldn't that be fantastic if this could be a way where the fourth industry could emerge that could actually empower the artists? Wouldn't that be amazing?\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And so these are just the moments. Like if you want change like that to happen, like now's the time. Because as things get re-sorted, uh, you have all sorts of people pushing for their particular vision for how the technology is going to affect the re-sorting, uh, and so like, you just need to go push hard.\n \nCHRISTINA WARREN: You need to push hard, get your voice out there. Don't be afraid about ruffling feathers. Just, you know, yeah, I totally agree with that. I totally agree that this is an important moment and an important opportunity. Well, that is all the time that we have for today. Huge, huge thanks to will.i.am for being with us.
