Like, it\u2019s like, I mean, all innovation around us is like \u2013 it comes from companies. It comes from journeys, it comes from \u2013 like entrepreneurships and builders getting together.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we\u2019re going to get behind the tech. We\u2019ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what\u2019s happening today. Stick around.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello, welcome to Behind The Tech. I\u2019m cohost Christina Warren, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And we are kicking off 2023 with an insightful conversation with Tobi L\u00fctke, who is the CEO and founder of the Canadian e\u2013commerce company, Shopify.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I\u2019ve been really looking forward to this conversation. Tobi and I have known each other for a few years. The company that he runs is sort of amazing. Like, I love anyone who is doing work, building platforms to help people run their businesses to you know, just empower them to do more of what they want. And I think Shopify is a really great company on that front. \n\nBut Tobi is a really unique CEO. He is a programmer and computer scientist by training, and, like, he just is deeply invested in his programmer roots. And I think you\u2019re going to hear a bunch of that in our conversation. He\u2019s a very unusual and impressive CEO.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I\u2019m super, super excited. All right, let\u2019s dive into your conversation with Tobi.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Tobi L\u00fctke is the CEO and Founder of Shopify, the Canadian multinational ecommerce platform that helps companies set up and run online stores. Growing up in Germany, he spent his time as a teacher, tinkering with computers and writing code. Tobi began his career as an entrepreneur when he and a friend decided to design an ecommerce platform to sell snowboards which eventually evolved into the concept that built Shopify. \n\nAs a programmer, Tobi has served on the core team of the Ruby on Rails framework and has created many popular opensource libraries. I\u2019ve been looking forward to this conversation for a really long while. Thank you for joining us, Tobi, and apologies in advance \u2013 we're doing this from my lab which can sometimes get a little bit noisy.\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Thanks for having me.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So we always start these conversations by going all the way back to what inspired you or how you go the spark to, you know, get interested in science and technology. So tell us a little bit about that.\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Yeah, I had \u2013 you\u2019d have to go all the way back. I got really lucky. So my dad is a doctor and he had - and this is in Germany - we had Macintosh in the house. These were sort of LC1 variety, you know, (inaudible) in the \u2013 growing up in the \u201880s, and I just like \u2013 I mean, there was no other magical object that existed on planet Earth that had nearly \u2013 this draw on me, right? It\u2019s like it just was \u2013 it was an interesting experience, going into the \u201880s and \u201890s.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and so what \u2013 and so you were \u2013 you started out with Macintosh programming, so what was it, MPW Pascal, was it HyperCard, what was your \u2013\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Exactly, it\u2019s \u2013 the usual suspects, but HyperCard was \u2013 like, you know, the whole concept of. I mean, I made HyperCard index cards for learning my Latin vocab \u2013 conjugations, and you know, shared them with the other kids that had a monitor, and a \u2013 but like, pretty quickly I found, like BASIC and Pascal, like eventually. I don\u2019t think I was any good at it, and like I was pretty young during those days.\n\nBut you know, just like the \u2013 the spark really happened then. You know, the German version of Byte magazine \u2013 I don\u2019t know if that was the same in North America. They often had listings in the back, you know, just \u2013 often, like a little videogame or something, and I would type them into my BASIC interpreter. I had, at this point, this BASIC computer. It\u2019s called an Amstrad CPC, which again is kind of a European thing.\n\nAnd you know, just like I very naturally started like \u2013 you know, to play the thing after it runs, and this is magic, and then you beat it, and you make it harder, and \u2013 and it \u2013 it was only like years and years later that someone told me this is called programming and has a name. This was just like using computers. And you ran out of things to do pretty quickly, so this is what I gravitated to.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and it\u2019s really interesting. In our generation, I think that is a fairly common experience. Like oftentimes, like games were the, you know, sort of provocative thing that captured your attention, and then it\u2019s just sort of hacking around with these systems, not even realizing that what \u2013 well, none of us certainly realized that what we were doing then we\u2019re going to inform, like all of the crazy stuff that we do now, right?\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Definitely not, but like it did feel, especially going from the \u201890s, a little bit \u2013 which probably looked very different. Again, I\u2019m from a small town, and \u2013 and really didn\u2019t know anyone who was into computers in a similar way I was. And we were connected through, you know, dialup modems, BBSs and so on, very quick download messages and it \u2013 sort of there was a bridge to Usenet.\n\nSo you were this outside observer to \u2013 you know more was going on, but you know, you were stepped out \u2013 like away from my bedroom, and the world wasn\u2019t changing. And \u2013 and people were \u2013 I remember very early in my teenage years that I had this realization where, you know what? The adults are \u2013 they do not understand what\u2019s coming. Because just it was just so obvious that everything would change, given this thing which was just simply not possible before.\n\nAnd you know, you could play the party tricks, where \u2013 especially with things like HyperCard, where, you know, some data entry job, you just made it like basically go away, and \u2013 but it was clear that there was more value there, and that this would have a much, much bigger impact in \u2013 like in the future.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so I\u2019m curious. So the German education system is a little bit different from the U.S. education system, so at some point, when you\u2019re a kid you get selected, and it\u2019s just always been unclear to me, like how much of a choice the student has, versus how much the system is sort of deciding for you, whether you\u2019re going to go do Fachhochschule, which is this vocational track, or you\u2019re going to Gymnasium, which prepares you to go to university.\n\nSo I presume you went on the Gymnasium track. Was there anything in Gymnasium when you went to, effectively, high school that was, you know, helps you learn programing, or you know, get you interested in computer science?\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Yeah, not \u2013 not in my experience. I mean, I\u2019m sure obviously, it\u2019s changed now, but like I was initially eventually \u2013 this is a really interesting meta topic, which is that Europe has a \u2013 especially this Germanic region of Europe, this sort of heritage of the craft is very different, and it\u2019s, North America does not understand it well. \n\nI know this for a fact because I have to constantly re-explain this because I, inside of Shopify, it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s well established that you have to kind of understand what vocation is and what craft is, in the European sense, to really understand the way the company thinks about itself.\n\nSo but anyway, I went into this more academic Gymnasium track initially, but I\u2019m just sort of hands-on. I would tinker. I\u2019m not, I don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s, academia for academia\u2019s sake is not for me, and \u2013 so I wanted to go, like more into the practical side. I found out that if you switch, I think after like ninth grade or eighth grade, I switched into the more vocational track of school, and then we did practicals and then \u2013 like I actually worked at a Siemens subsidiary for like a couple of \u2013 like for a month or so, which was just the most magical thing to me.\n\nAnd it was clear that I wanted to leave school as soon as I could because it, just everyone was teaching things that were just kind of the exact things that I didn\u2019t think would be super relevant in the future, and then the wisdom of a vocational system allows you to leave school after tenth grade and start as an apprentice.\n\nAnd so that\u2019s what I did. I was actually \u2013 most, like the first year where computer programming was taught as a craft, in the vocation system, and I\u2019m so glad that I hit that particular timing window because things would have gone very different otherwise. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: This whole idea of computer science and programming is just a huge category, and I\u2019ve always wondered for \u2013 for myself, like I\u2019m also practically inclined.\n\nLike I like to write code. You know, it\u2019s why I studied compilers versus theoretical computer science. It was like this perfect mix of you\u2019ve got a little bit of theory that was sort of intellectually satisfying, but at the end of the day, the thing that you wanted to do was like build a compiler and optimization pass, or like something, and in the very truest sense. Like you\u2019re building a tool for other people to pick up and use to do their craft.\n\nAnd so like, I\u2019ve always thought of it as craft, but some of it is art, and I do think some of it is like legitimately science, and there\u2019s like this blurry boundary between all of them, but like treating it \u2013 treating it as if like all of it is this sort of wholly academic scientific thing, always. It just never appealed to me.\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Yeah, I think it\u2019s a side effect of a way academia sorted itself, right? Like, it \u2013 they had to put it in some building when computation came around, not realizing that it probably ought to have had its own building because there\u2019s a lot of different things that it needed, and I think the people that don\u2019t doggedly, like associate themselves with like this \u2013 we\u2019re a scientist, we do science-y things, but rather follow the value \u2013 you know, like treat all these different disciplines as like sources of inspiration and energy and value, and \u2013 and pull it from all of them, just to get the task done. \n\nThose are hugely the vocational people, right? And I think this is something we \u2013 like I think we see this, you know, in a lot of places. I mean, take a very recent example. I feel like machine learning is currently being like recaptured by the tinkerers, and with much more of a vocational bent, because being able to do cool things with their own GPUs, rather than calling APIs, and you know, many of the greatest things will not be used like this, this way, because they\u2019re just too big for machines, but just the ability for people to start tinkering, just leads to all sorts of better tooling and better \u2013 like great writing.\n\nAnd like people from different backgrounds entering the machine learning area, which obviously is the kind of created melting points for \u2013 where suddenly focus accelerates.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and I think, look, it leads to better applications as well. So one of the things that I really strongly believe about all of the stuff that\u2019s happening in AI and machine learning right now is, if we can\u2019t make what we\u2019re doing into an accessible platform for people to do this tinkering \u2013 you know, whether it\u2019s \u2013 you know, you\u2019re downloading a copy of Stable Diffusion, and you know, getting it to run on your own machine, on your own GPU card, plugged into your PC, or it\u2019s calling someone else\u2019s API.\n\nLike the API calls have to be unrestricted enough and cheap enough where you can just tinker. You know, if we can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re not going to really get the full breadth of the interesting stuff that\u2019s sitting in people\u2019s imaginations that they don\u2019t even know is there.\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Absolutely. The core of a craft is like converting something into something, right? Like, like any craft that exists is sort of a \u2013 that particular process is like people who convert wood into furniture are carpenters.\n\nOne thing which is really inspired about these things is that they really \u2013 it\u2019s the identity of a carpenter, that they are a carpenter. Their identity is actually that they\u2019re a craftsperson, and that the particular craft that they are \u2013 that they\u2019ve pursued, and that they\u2019ve done their \u2013 they become a master in, it\u2019s usually just their aptitude, and it\u2019s a very common type of person, which is also really useful, because therefore some crafts exist for a moment, and then they don\u2019t exist anymore, they\u2019re no longer needed.\n\nLike the blacksmith has finally figured out what to do next. And so I think that\u2019s \u2013 like all of this is actually really worth sort of understanding, and because \u2013 you know, like I sometimes talk to, you know, junior engineers who describe themselves as, \"I\u2019m a React front-end developer,\" and like, \"Wow, you just put two little bits into your identity, but you really don\u2019t need to, because \u2013 like I think you\u2019re actually much more than that because you can solve problems extremely well.\"\n\nThe rallying cry is like, people who were able to make the things that they really want with what they\u2019ve got, like that\u2019s sort of at the core of it, and I love that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I think that\u2019s a beautiful definition, and more to your point, like I think some craftspeople really do associate themselves more with their tools than with the process, and it\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s like a narrowing thing. Like it actually happens in woodworking right now. \n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Does it?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, like I\u2019m a woodworker, and so \u2013 like there\u2019s some woodworkers who are like, \"Oh, it\u2019s not really woodworking unless you are doing it all with hand tools,\" and you know, there are some woodworkers who are like, \"Oh, no, no, it\u2019s only woodworking if you do it with power tools, but CNC is completely unacceptable.\"\n\nAnd, it\u2019s all the same craft, like you\u2019re just wielding your tools in different ways and the tools evolve, and so it\u2019s very interesting, that mindset, I think.\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: It\u2019s funny because \u2013 I mean, there\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s clearly some common ground somewhere, but no one ought to be a hammer carpenter, like that\u2019s too fine grained, so everyone agrees, but you shouldn\u2019t narrow the focus too much, but like the degree by which people agree is something to be debated.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and one of the things that I\u2019ve seen in some of the most creative and successful craftspeople across any of these disciplines is the agility that they have to adapt to new tools, to sort of say, \"Oh, this is new and interesting. I\u2019m going to incorporate this into my craft because it helps me do the thing that I care about, better.\"\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Yeah, I think this one skill, like how quickly you can get value out of new tools and how quickly do you spot better and better tools would make a substantial improvement to things that you that are worth improving on. It\u2019s like the unacknowledged meta skill of all the most successful people on planet Earth. And I think it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s really that. Like it\u2019s so \u2013 it, it just \u2013 once you look for it, it\u2019s really stunning. Like it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s, you really do not hear stories of extremely successful people who are absolutely set in their ways, and it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s, it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a fascinating \u2013 At least, okay, you can probably find some people in some areas, but like, very unlikely to find this in \u2013 in anywhere close to where you make things.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, so I want to go back to this thing that you mentioned a few minutes ago, which is this idea of apprenticeship, which I think is very, very powerful, and so my experience with this, as a programmer, was I always did my academic work and my programming work side by side, but they were relatively separate from one another.\n\nSo like, I would have a side job where I was, you know, writing firmware for industrial controllers, or I was helping someone build an internet site. Like this is all back in the early \u201890s, and then I would go study computer science at school. And like it was always confusing to me that they were as separate as they were. \n\nAnd I even remember, when I left my PhD studies to go join Google, I probably got more benefit, in terms of developing my craft as a programmer, that first six months at Google than anything else I did the rest of my programming life, and I, it really was an apprenticeship. So like it was the special thing about the culture at the time is that your peer engineers valued spending their time in code reviews, and like writing good documentation for the things that they were producing for building things in a way, like a first-order bit of their job was making a thing that someone else could reuse.\n\nLike they were all, like teaching me how to be a better engineer, and I wonder how you think about that at Shopify, because \u2013 like you, you sort of run your company as someone with programmer mindset, which I find very fascinating.\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Yeah, I mean, the concept of \u2013 I have tried to reproduce the concept of apprenticeship because I love it as well, although it requires sort of a double opt in, which is hard to manufacture, I\u2019ve found. We had limited success with this, but we did have some, but it \u2013 there is a bit of a cultural norm.\n\nI mean, the first thing about \u2013 vocational system in Germany, that\u2019s really hard to replace. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s extremely parent compatible, right? Like parents are like, you know, \"Godspeed. Go, go, go into the crafts, make \u2013 do your honest work,\" and after apprenticeship also, you can go back to university afterwards. Like it\u2019s optional which track you take. You can do academic \u2013 next couple of years, or you do a vocational one.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, so \u2013 so it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s respected.\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: It\u2019s respected, and that\u2019s a really, really important thing because I \u2013 I\u2019m \u2013 it\u2019s, it was obviously easier to convince, you know, students to say, \"Hey, you should actually go full-time,\" just like you did with Google, because you kind of like \u2013 like this is your \u2013 but the parents would say, \"No chance.\"\n\nSo I\u2019ve had dinners with parents trying to explain how this all can work out, and it\u2019s just like very little pickup. So that\u2019s sort of an interesting aspect. But the other thing is also the mindset of the \u2013 of the apprentice. Like you are \u2013 like they don\u2019t even call you an apprentice, at least at my place. They didn\u2019t call you apprentice. For first year, you were \u2013 they called pen\u2019 \u2013 like Stift, which is just short for pencil.\n\nAnd like basically you were, utility, to be, like utilized for certain tasks, and like I cooked \u2013 made coffee for everyone. I did the photocopying. I helped out in accounting. I actually did inventory sorting \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s so important.\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: And now, like \u2013 and now we are building warehouses, and I can draw on like weird lessons that I\u2019ve had doing something which \u2013 some people describe as a hazing, but like it was actually \u2013 it was very good, it was \u2013 it was a perfect place to enter the workforce because you  it just, I don\u2019t even know what it does. Like humility in a way, but also just like perspective is fantastic.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, I \u2013 look, I think, honestly, it\u2019s a really good entrepreneurial lesson because when you \u2013 when you are undertaking a new endeavor, like all that stuff needs to get done. Like the coffee needs to be made, the dishes need to be washed, the inventory needs to be \u2013 I mean, like all of these, and like you have to \u2013 I think as an entrepreneur, like part of your job is figuring out how are you going to be of service to your team and of service to the tasks that you are doing? And not being overly precious about what your role in that is, like just having flexibility, like, \"I will do whatever needs to be done.\"\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: I couldn\u2019t agree more. You, you really have to I mean, at the very least, you should have a non-theoretical understanding of every little job that exists because otherwise how do you \u2013 how can you judge what great work is, right? Like it\u2019s, this is a very important part of what entrepreneurs have to do in a business, and you judge your own work because you\u2019re doing every job in the beginning, and then you use that skill to actually help other people like reach higher than they might have otherwise imagined they would.\n\nSo those principles are super valuable, and just there\u2019s very enduring truths, right? Like this is, you can find \u2013 like, Cicero talked about Roman times, about the importance of having hands-on experience at everything.\n\nI\u2019m, I\u2019m not sure if he would go all the way down to \u2013 in that particular society, with those things, and \u2013 but the virtues of these ideas are well known to us, and so \u2013 in Shopify, so you are right. I operate under the fundamental assumption that all companies are terrible, that \u2013 all of the ones ever created, which you know, like I \u2013 I, some people don\u2019t love me saying this, but like I \u2013 I think, to me, this is actually inspiring because, boy, building companies is worth it.\n\nLike, it\u2019s like, I mean, all innovation around us is like \u2013 it comes from companies. It comes from journeys, it comes from \u2013 like entrepreneurships and builders getting together. You build this incredible legal structure which allows deeply caring, hardworking people to get together, align everyone\u2019s economic incentives, and allow them to just like pour themselves into, like really tough problems for \u2013 you know, sometimes their entire work life, and I think it\u2019s a beautiful thing that we have something like this. And so we should be good at it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and I tend to agree with you. All of what you just said is the inspiring bit, and like I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s an existence proof for how to go accomplish the most complicated things that humans get up to, without this sort of structure. Like maybe there\u2019s something else, but like, I think the only other thing might be like a national emergency, like you\u2019re going to war, or something like that.\n\nBut like companies I think do a pretty good job of doing what you said, like sort of aligning the interests of a whole bunch of people to accomplish a task that\u2019s, you know, too big for any one of them, individually, to accomplish. And like, that\u2019s sort of a necessity, right, because companies are kind of miserable, right? It, it\u2019s just sort of hard, hard work to get a group of people together to do these complicated things, and there\u2019s so many, like entropic pulls, to \u2013 you know, misery and inefficiency and friction and so like that\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019d love to hear your take on like how you think about solving some of these problems at Shopify, but like it just is a constant struggle against all of these things to, like make a company work well.\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Yeah, so I would be really sad if people tell \u2013 if someone would come to me in the future and say, \"Hey, like the companies of today are the most efficient companies ever will exist, and there\u2019s not much to be improved.\" I would probably be uninterested in doing my job if that would be the case.\n\nSo again, if something is terrible, it\u2019s very motivating to me because, like I draw motivation from dissatisfaction with the status quo, usually. That\u2019s my sort of source of energy, and so if you would take any \u2013 I mean, the World Cup, the World Soccer Cup is going on right now, and you always see these like replays \u2013 like replays of the goals, and sometimes an analysis, and like it\u2019s just like, every single player is just in the right spot, right?\n\nLike it\u2019s \u2013 this is like the top of the game, where it matters more \u2013 like people who have spent their entire lives, like training for this moment, but like there\u2019s lots of mistakes. Like, it\u2019s like if you actually get down to it, like individual muscles that were activated, you\u2019re probably like talking about like 70% efficiency, or something like this. Like, we are getting close, like as close as we can.\n\nBut if you freeze-frame every frame, and analyze, like is everyone exactly where they should be or are there different opportunities they didn\u2019t spot within the moment, you will find them. If you do that with a company, what\u2019s the \u2013 if they, if a professional player gets to 70%, companies probably get to seven, right? Like there are so many memos that no one reads, so many meetings that should be an email, and so many projects that, you know, are like local maxima optimizations of something that no one would have to do, if everyone would just spend a moment figuring out what does a global company want from its mission, right?\n\nLike, so I certainly have not cracked the code on how to solve these problems, but I mean, again, what\u2019s motivating to me is like at the end of my career I want to have conversations with my contemporaries and say I want to know that I\u2019ve done the best job I could have possibly done, and maybe I\u2019m going to be slightly less embarrassed, by my company, so that would be awesome.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it\u2019s really \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s interesting to hear you frame it this way because when we were building LinkedIn, for instance, like we thought about it a lot in these terms. There\u2019s this economist-philosopher named Frank Kaufmann, who \u2013 one of the exercises he does is \u2013 you know, to a group of leaders, he walks into the room, and he asks folks on a football team, \"What\u2019s the job of the goalkeeper?\" And people will confidently raise their hand and say it\u2019s to \u2013 you know, play that position and keep the ball out of the goal, and he\u2019s like, \"No, you\u2019re wrong,\" like their job is to help the team win the game, and like that \u2013 that mentality, I think, in the best football teams is probably why they get to 70% efficiency. \n\nIt\u2019s not just about being at peak performance for themselves, but like paying attention to, like everything else that\u2019s happening on the field, with their opponents and their teammates and being willing to get into whatever position you need to be in to assist your team in winning the game. And that\u2019s just sort of \u2013 it gets harder, the bigger you get, you know, probably quadratically, at least, and you know, you\u2019re just sort of fighting against a bunch of impulses, right? \n\nLike, one of the catastrophic failings of sports teams is, like, if you get an egomaniac on the team who, like, wants the whole game to be about them. And, like, you sort of see those pathologies inbig companies. \n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, with business is like, people have, like, a different incentive hierarchy than the team. And \u2013 and, you know, that\u2019s a book, which made a really big impression on me. I read it, like, sort of, like, very early, and then recently, again, written by James Carse, which is it\u2019s named Finite and Infinite Games. And it\u2019s actually \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty dense, philosophical book. But it feels extremely actionable, because it really explains how, you know, the \u2013 you know, some things are, I mean\u2026 \n\nLike, the world is, like, completely controlled by finite games, partly because they have clear goals, and they are measurable, and they\u2019re fun, and they\u2019re easy to communicate, and they are\u2026 you just know how you do. Like, there\u2019s a score, and you know if you\u2019re winning, but there are infinite games as well. \n\nSo, like, for instance, like, every person on planet Earth is, I think, I hope, engaged in an infinite game towards wisdom, towards, like, education. Like, these are unwinnable games. They have no goal orientation, and there\u2019s no way to finish them, right? Like, those could go on forever. But we\u2019ve structured the world in such a way that we encode these infinite pursuits underneath finite games, like school, like Grade 1, Grade 2. Like, you can win Grade 1 by qualifying for Grade 2, and you can win the math test by getting a high score.\n\nOne thing which is unfortunate, I think, which happens at some point is that people end up getting so addicted sort of in this sort of empty calories, dopamine way to how they\u2019re doing on the finite games and the scores, that they completely lose their pursuit of more important infinite goals. And I think that\u2019s  a problem that\u2019s avoidable. It\u2019s a cultural thing. \n\nAnd, again, I could talk about how this informs some of the things we\u2019re doing at Shopify, but, like, I don\u2019t actually know how to get the most value out of these ideas, per se. I just know that eventually, we will figure out how to turn what I just said into the perfect fortune cookie. And once it is compressed this way in such a way that it \u201closslessly\u201d uncompresses into the right set of ideas, after it\u2019s communicated, whoever figures that one out will do better than everyone else. And then hopefully, in the sort of Darwinian process of ideas, it\u2019ll be something that becomes better known and better communicated. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it really is a tough set of problems, because\u2026 and it\u2019s tough on a bunch of different images. Like, one of them, for instance, is in a complicated company \u2013 and I\u2019m sure Shopify is at the point where it\u2019s a complicated company \u2013 you have people like you who probably have, like, this very wide horizontal view of what\u2019s going on that not many other people have. And then you have people who have these, like, very narrow vertical views of some part of the company. And both of those things are sort of necessary, and they both occupy a huge amount of space in your head. \n\nAnd so, it\u2019s just sort of hard. I mean, like, it would be impossible for you, for instance, to, like, have the sum of all of those little detail vertical bits of knowledge in your head at one time. And it would probably be very hard for someone who\u2019s, like, deep in the weeds of, you know, like, hey, I\u2019ve got to solve this particular problem in this backend code to get the latency down. And there\u2019s some weird bug, you know, whatever it might be, to have time to, like, see the whole horizontal view. \n\nAnd so, like, you know, part of the hell of setting up a company is, like, how do you \u2013 you know, how do you balance those two things out? Like, how do you free the people who need to go do this detailed stuff to have enough context about what\u2019s going on? And so, when they\u2019re making their decisions every day, they choose to spend their time on the right things. \n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Totally. I mean, this is the hardest challenge related to alignment. It\u2019s the alignment challenge of companies.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Right.\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: We\u2019re hearing a lot about alignment challenges in \u2013 in AI, and I feel, like, we should solve the people ones first.  It\u2019s \u2013 I would love to have an RLHF for my HR, my company.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and you might one day. (Laughter.)\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Yeah, I might one day. So, this is actually\u2026 look, your listeners are, like, this is a lot of highly technical people. A lot of them are in key roles in the businesses they are in. \n\nI think, a thing we talked about earlier, which is sort of academia sort of decided it\u2019s computer science. And therefore, it\u2019s going to STEM. And it\u2019s sort of, like, that\u2019s its swim lane. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re still a little bit, like, there\u2019s a hangover from that idea, which means that I don\u2019t think the technical \u2013 the sort of technically minded people, especially the ones who make it high up in an organization structure tend to be people who can reason very well across very complicated systems, because that\u2019s what we built, right? Like, you know, the architects and the people will find the novel solutions, which means that\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s a \u2013 there\u2019s a wonderful story. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a true story. Sorry for the aside. That I read\u2026 Man, yeah, let me go back. And if I don\u2019t get this, right, don\u2019t \u2013 this was a long time ago, that I heard about this, where I think Charles Petzold from Microsoft actually talked about it, who writes amazing books \u2013 shout out \u2013 which I read, and now read to my children.\n\nAnyway, he retold the story. There was an event of where I think Bill Gates was introducing Basic, and there was a programming contest, like, Storm The Gates, I think was it called. This is, like, weird memories coming back to me. And you were supposed to, like, write code, which was, like, quicker than Bill using Basic, presumably in Pascal or Sembla or something like this. \n\nAnd some \u2013 someone ended up winning by realizing that the spec was draw a circle on the screen at different alternating differences of circumference, and realized you could do this with an uppercase and lowercase O \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 so, which, of course, like, somehow, somewhere in this story, again, is this incredible pragmatic-ness of, like, being able to spot, like, the sort of Pareto Principle. Here\u2019s how we can solve this issue without having to do all the hard work. Like, we don\u2019t actually have to build an entire GUI stack. We can actually just solve the spec this way. \n\nAnyway, sorry for the aside. Like, the people who are high up in companies are trained on systems thinking and don\u2019t know it, because this is what we do in engineering. Engineering is an applied field of systems thinking in the same way how poker is an applied field of game theory. And this actually took a while in my own journey after, you know, running a company which was getting increasingly big. I tried to, very hard, to check my biases of, like, hey, engineering would solve this this way. But of course, you are a professional in HR. Therefore, you understand how this really works. \n\nAnd, you know, often this is true, but sometimes, like, our industry has solved problems that are not fathomable by people who are in other fields, in other disciplines. And so, I really highly encourage people to take more of an engineering, like a systems engineering, a company engineering approach to their businesses. \n\nFundamentally, everyone who works in a company is an intelligent actor working in accordance with their incentive system. A lot of it is sort of entropy reversion to the mean that happens in companies. You know, people talk about it as politics, people talk about it as bureaucracy, people talk about it as process. These are all proxy words for \u201cthis sucks.\u201d \n\nA lot of this just happens because people want to improve the place. They identify true problems, but they don\u2019t have the ability to create processes or systems, one set of systems that actually are effortless. But computers are very good at it. A lot of other problems arise if the people who can create the processes are the actors in the systems, because incentives aren\u2019t aligned there. \n\nSo, one \u2013 you know, at some point, I realized Shopify was getting really inefficient in, like, all these random ways. Like, there\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know, on 5,000 or 10,000, people of staff, we had like \u2013 like 5,000 different titles, partly because I realized at some point, my God, like, this company\u2019s people systems are basically like, I don\u2019t know, like a Windows 95 computer connected to the modern Internet, unpatched, giving everyone root access. And like, if that\u2019s your situation, then you probably are going to end up with really random, hard\u2013to\u2013document, like, incentive systems in the company. And you will never spot who is acting according to which. \n\nAnd I think, you know, like, I don\u2019t know, these days, all our people systems, titling, comm frameworks, levels, disciplines, and sub disciplines, and all these kinds of things exist in a GitHub repository, that you have to formulate a pull request against if you want to make a change. And then there\u2019s going to be a discussion and unless it is committed, this is not happening. \n\nAnd that\u2019s not actually that crazy of a change, although it\u2019s a little bit of a hard tool to initially explain to the HR team. But once you\u2019re there, everyone loves it because now, you know, that \u2013 something that was previously kind of crazy, suddenly is totally\u2026 like, there\u2019s a shared understanding of how the system evolves forward. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I \u2013 so, I love that example. I think you and I were chatting about that at some event a few months ago. And I was like, this is \u2013 it\u2019s like, really, really inventive and creative, because part of the struggle that you deal with in these complicated organizations, where you\u2019ve got a lot of different people with a lot of different information is just sort of sharing context. \n\nLike, how did this decision get made? What is the real problem that we\u2019re trying to solve? Like, what have we tried before that didn\u2019t work? And, like, what did we try before that did work? And, like, what can we all learn from these? So, like, having a way to, like, codify these decisions, like, where you\u2019ve got the whole pull request history and, I mean, I think it\u2019s really smart. \n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: And it\u2019s extremely powerful. Like, we\u2019ve been doing, like, I've been working on this one a while, and I actually, you know, write code along on this repository, which is doing this kind of thing. And they\u2019re using, like, tools, which are, again, made by engineers for engineering problems, but actually generalized to people system cases in ways that I think isn\u2019t clear to people. \n\nSo, for instance, you\u2019ll like this because this is your thing. Probably the most sort of politics\u2013inducing process that I\u2019ve ever encountered in my company is headcount allocation. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. (Laughter.)\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Because it\u2019s \u2013 you know, it\u2019s very many \u2013 like, a lot of things aren\u2019t zero sum games, and people just pretend they are. But some things are, you know, resources are finite, and \u2013 and it\u2019s a rivalrous process, right? Like, and headcount allocation is clearly one of those. \n\nSo, we now in the same GitHub repository, we have a full, like stated via DSL. The principles by which Shopify does headcount, the decisions that are high level on, like, which groups should be which size. And then we run it through, I think it\u2019s called Z3. It\u2019s a SAT solver, like an optimized version of a SAT solver, which comes out of Microsoft Research. \n\nAnd I read the entire doc on it. It talks about every single problem that you could imagine, except not headcount allocation. (Laughter.) So, it\u2019s \u2013 certainly an off\u2013label use, but, like, it\u2019s magical. Like, it\u2019s a magical tool applied in this space. \n\nAnd it\u2019s an incredibly complex problem, and it solves \u2013 like, suddenly, people don\u2019t have to go fight. People just \u2013 I mean, people will make their cases on the principal level, and then we make decisions, which are committed. And then on CI, the thing reruns, and it generates data and a book. (Laughter.) And, like, everyone can read how many people they get. So, it\u2019s really neat, if you can get there.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I \u2013 I think, again, that\u2019s super smart. Like, this is one of the very interesting things I think about, being in an organization and making decisions. Like, frequently, like, all of this stuff, that sort of politics and emotion and whatnot, goes away as soon as everybody understands what the rubric is for making the decision. And they believe that it\u2019s fair, that the decision maker or the decision making process, like in the case, this SAT solver that you\u2019re using, like, has seen all of the relevant data, when it is producing the solution, the decision. So, I think it\u2019s clever. \n\nThe one thing that I will add, though, I agree with you that headcount allocation is mostly a zero sum problem. But there are ways to, like, make it slightly non zero in that I find, oftentimes, people haven\u2019t really asked themselves, when they want another person on their team, like, why do I want another person? Have I exploited every other possible way to, like, get the work done that I think this new person is necessary for?\n\nAnd, you know, sometimes, there\u2019s, like, a bunch of shadow reasons for adding people. It\u2019s like, oh, well, it\u2019s a score that I\u2019m keeping, you know, on, you know, how influential I am as a manager, or, like, I need to collect these many people tokens before I can advance to the next level. You know, and I\u2019m \u2013 like, I\u2019m not even making fun of it. Like, I\u2019m sure I have done this myself in the past. \n\nBut oftentimes, when people really look at what they need to do, like, there\u2019s other ways to accomplish the problem than adding another head. And, like, adding another head to a team, like, just bigger is always worse, honestly. So, you don\u2019t want to be big, unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. \n\nHave you built the tools that you need to do to make yourself more efficient? Like, have you, like, tried to go in and clean up a bunch of friction that you have in the system? Like, for the love of God, don\u2019t add more people just to cover up, you know, for inefficiencies that you\u2019ve let creep into the system. \n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: It\u2019s also bad for the planet, right? Like, if people do this, because, like, I mean, every problem that can be solved by one person should be solved by one person, because there\u2019s nothing more efficient. Like, you know, I type 120 words per minute. That\u2019s not even, like, the speed of a modem from the \u201890s. And \u2013 but our brain interconnects with, like, some multi\u2013terabytes of synaptic bandwidth. \n\nSo, if you encounter a problem that can be solved by a single person, the speed of communication internally to the brain to, like, having \u2013 to even just one other person is just, like, magnitudes different. This is why you have ultra\u2013efficient people, if people have a range to solve all aspects of a problem. Now, of course, this is sort of\u2026 you know, sometimes it\u2019s getting rarer, that that happens, although hopefully, we\u2019ll stage a comeback. \n\nNow if you add people just because, hey, we need at least three people so that, you know, if anyone goes on vacation kind of thing, then\u2026 and the problem could have been solved by one person, now there\u2019s two people who are there to slow down one person, really, instead of, like, being an individual doing something really remarkable, the best they\u2019ve got, again. And it\u2019s just kind of not \u2013 no one benefits from this other than, like, I don\u2019t know, like, it looks good in a spreadsheet, I guess. So, I think those are real conversations. \n\nI cut my teeth \u2013 like, so after \u2013 after learning programming, working at this apprenticeship, one of the coolest things about growing up in Germany and \u2013 and in the 90s was this \u2013 what was previously referred to as the demo scene, which is really the, this was really pre\u2013Internet. It was super expensive to go on Internet, so we really \u2013 we had mailboxes that we downloaded, BBSs. So, but we would have a lot of these LAN parties where, like, on a weekend, 1,000, 500 people would bring their computers. And then it was almost a festival where code was celebrated like a craft. \n\nSo, there was competitions you could enter at, like, four kilobytes, 64 kilobyte and two megabytes, and you just were making art, right? Like, we\u2019re making something that was launched, shown and rated by everyone.\n\nAnd this is where I learned to really program and, you know, we did all this in Assembler. And we were engaged in a four kilobyte category, which is like the .exe header, the PE header is too large. \n\nLike, you were making comm files. And you\u2019re like, you\u2019re are not importing anything there. So, it was absolutely incredible, like, just procedurally generating textures, and landscapes and so on, like, programming for the art of it. \n\nAnd so, you know, like, I mean, we\u2019re recording this in 20\u2026 right at the end of 2022, very different world than it was 12 months ago. I sort of talked about the 2021 energy as sort of the tail end of the boom times. And now, there\u2019s like a 2022 energy around us, which I think, whatever else it does, it really compels people to think more about what to do with limited resources, right? \n\nAnd actually, this is so much better. Like, it\u2019s not engineering, if you have infinite resources. That is called daydreaming. (Laughter.)\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: It doesn\u2019t qualify as engineering if you think, oh, we could refactor this to be so perfect, if you had unlimited time. And, you know, like, yeah, that \u2013 that\u2019s hallucination. That\u2019s not actually engineering. Engineering is getting the thing you want with what you\u2019ve got. And I think that\u2019s actually a very good energy to seep into our industry again, because we lost this a little bit. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I could not agree with you more, and I wish we had more time. We\u2019re almost at the end. But, like, maybe very quickly, I could ask you... what outside \u2013 and so, I know, like, being CEO of, like, one of the fastest growing, most important e-commerce companies on the planet is a lot of work. But like, what outside of work do you do for fun? Like, what\u2019s energizing you right now? \n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Right now, I am playing Dwarf Fortress. (Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Nice.\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: But like, I mean, I tinker a lot. I mean, I have three kids; I have three boys, 12, 10 and eight. I \u2013 we\u2019ll be on Replit together and using Kahoot \u2013 no, Kaboom, anyway, like, for making video games, which is really, really fun. And we fell in love with this open source fantasy console called TIC\u201380, which is, like, basically a computer like they were when I was a kid. \n\nAnd so, these are fun things, but I tinker a lot. I love technology. I am as addicted as \u2013 although sometimes annoyed as everyone else \u2013 to Hacker News as I ever have been. I have a home lab at home that\u2019s now has increasingly getting GPUs, because I\u2019m doing more machine learning. It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s all built on Nix, because that seemed interesting to learn. \n\nAnd, in fact, I learned from Nix how to build deterministic, reproducible environments and the value of them. And that actually influenced the HR system we built, which is like, think about that for a moment. \n\nI think there\u2019s \u2013 like, I think there\u2019s a school of thought about what creativity is, which says that creativity is predominantly the extraction of incredibly insightful ideas out of obscure fields and moving them into others where they are of just as much value, once contextualized. And I believe that. I really think that I find tons and tons of inspirations in this \u2013 like, in this tinkering. \n\nI\u2019m doing the advent of code right now. I\u2019m trying to do it in a different programming language every day of this year. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: What\u2019s your favorite programming language right now? \n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: I mean, I \u2013 like, Ruby fits into my brain better than anything else. And I just love \u2013 man, I could spend an hour talking about this, but, like, I wish people would give Ruby more of a chance because there\u2019s ideas encoded in it, which are necessary in the rest of the programming world. \n\nLike, making a programming language optimized for programmer happiness is just, like, important. Like, we are not machines, we\u2019re humans. And we love aesthetics and these kinds of things, even though it just seems inefficient sometimes to the sort of more shape rotator types. \n\nI really enjoy Zig right now. It just also seems like, I love everything that is a clear, novel take on problems that I recognize to be worth solving, right? Like, I \u2013 doing this comp time thing is brilliant. Struggling a little bit with Rust. \n\nIt\u2019s just like, the learning curve, it\u2019s hard. I know I\u2019m going to love it once I clear the borrow checker hurdle, but, like, I keep running my head into it. And yeah, actually, TypeScript is very, very good. TypeScript, I like, too, so.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome. Well, I \u2013\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: What about you? What is \u2013 what\u2019s your favorite programming language? Like, can I ask this? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. \n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: This is probably politically charged for you. (Laughter.)\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: No, no, no, it\u2019s not politically charged at all. So, I \u2013 my default \u2013 \n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: I love all my children. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. No, my default programming language for just a really long time now, since I was an engineer at Google, has been Python. Yeah, it\u2019s very comfortable, like, the way that I think is harmonized with the with the language. And I\u2019m sure, you know, sort of influenced in both directions. But yeah, and I\u2019m intrigued by Rust. Like, it\u2019s an interesting \u2013 interesting learning curve. I\u2026 \n\nYou know, I\u2019ve been doing a bunch of, like, weird machining stuff, like, which we\u2019ve talked about before. And so, like, there\u2019s a bunch of procedural stuff that I\u2019m doing with, with machining, where I\u2019m sort of taking a tool where you are graphically laying in a bunch of tool paths for a thing that you\u2019re trying to make. And then I will export the code from that, which is usually G code, or, like, there\u2019s this programming language called Simple for the DATRON CNC machine that I have. And then I\u2019m writing a bunch of code to transform that in a bunch of weird ways to get the machining effects that I want. \n\nAnd, like, what I really want is to be able to have a coding assistant, like, an AI assistant help me with all of this stuff, because I think there\u2019s no reason to think that you can\u2019t, in natural language, describe most of what it is I\u2019m doing and have an assistant help you out with it. \n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 I mean, I am so ready \u2013 I started doing a lot more programming again, like, two, three years ago, because I just kind of \u2013 I was really missing it. \n\nAnd luckily, friends at GitHub hooked me up with, like, early access to GitHub Copilot. And I am just like \u2013 I mean, I used to do all of Shopify\u2019s programming, doing pair programming with my \u2013 with one of my co\u2013founders. And we would play, like, a test driven development. And we would \u2013 we would basically do this bug ping pong kind of thing, where we were trying to be lazy, as lazy as possible to solve for unit tests that the other person wrote, and go back and forth. \n\nAnd like, but this is really fun for me, this kind of thing, but it\u2019s hard to reproduce. Like, everyone\u2019s scared of me now. Like, now, I can\u2019t just go pair with someone random.\n\nHonestly, working with Copilot is actually very close to this. Like, it really reminds me of, like, of pair programming with someone who\u2019s always available. And it\u2019s just like, again, it\u2019s such a cool time to be in this space and be able to get to solve problems, and tinker with technology. It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019ll be seen as the golden age forever, basically, from this point forward.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. That, I very much agree with you. And so, on that note, thank you so much for being on the podcast today. And I could easily spend another couple hours chatting with you. So, hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to chat again. \n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Awesome. Yeah, really enjoyed this, too. Thanks so much for having me, Kevin.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Cool.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: What a great conversation with Tobi L\u00fctke. You know, as you mentioned, kind of at the top, he is such a pure engineer, through and through. And that was actually something that kind of struck me, as the two of you were talking, is he is obviously very entrepreneurial minded, and is a very good leader and thinks very thoughtfully about business. But he also approaches the way that he runs his business as an engineer in every aspect of everything that he does. It\u2019s like he can\u2019t turn it off. I love it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And you can sort of see it. I mean, he and I, even before this interview, had talked about him applying some of these computer science and programming techniques to unusual places in the company, like how you do some HR things, like allocating headcount to teams, and, you know, like, how you document how you\u2019re making the important decisions that you make in the company. \n\nAnd so, like, I just love that mindset in general. And at the core, I think he talked about it a couple of different ways. Like, he really thinks of himself more as a craftsperson than, like, a scientist, or even like a business executive, I would imagine, where he\u2019s always thinking about, like, what can I make from what I have?\n\nAnd what he has is an important problem and a really amazing team. And he\u2019s just constantly trying to think about, like, what tools can I use to mold the material of this company, this organization, this ecosystem into something that is not just satisfying the needs of the customer but is well built.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes. No, I completely agree, and especially, it\u2019s in an area that it needs to be well built, especially for what Shopify does. What kind of struck me, as you were even saying that, is that, you know, you\u2019re right, he takes this craftsmanship approach. And I think he sees himself that way. But it also kind of comes through with the product itself, right? You talk about how they\u2019re building this platform. \n\nBut fundamentally, Shopify is a platform for people to be able to build their own businesses, and build their own things, and sell things they\u2019ve maybe crafted themselves, if that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. So, it kind of, you know, serendipitous and almost comes full circle in that regard.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, for sure. And again, like, we could have spent several more hours talking about things, because I think Tobi is truly a systems thinker and, like, thinks about things from first principles, and, like, not in that sort of superficial way. Like, I think it\u2019s, you know, become a little bit trendy in the past \u2013 past year to say, \u201coh, I\u2019m a first principles thinker.\u201d\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But this is just deeply wired into the way that Tobi thinks about the world, and it results in him just getting to, like, really impressive outcomes, like non\u2013obvious things, just because he\u2019s willing to think about things differently. And I love that.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I love that too. I\u2019ve had a number of friends over the years who work at Shopify, or some of them who have worked at Shopify, and to a person, they\u2019ve all really had great things to say about him. And I think that comes through because, you know, especially, you can see it in the product, and the employees definitely see it. And I think you\u2019re right, I think it comes from taking that first principles approach and really thinking thoughtfully about the things that he\u2019s doing.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and, like, maybe my \u2013 selfishly, my favorite part of the conversation was right there at the end where, like, we\u2019re sort of, you know, trading, like, what\u2019s our favorite technical thing right now.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, I always feel like I learned something, talking with Tobi.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, honestly, I said this to you off\u2013mic, but I\u2019ll say it on the pod as well. I could listen to an entire hour of just that. And so, Tobi, if you ever want to do, like, a Behind The Tech behind the scenes episode, like bonus episode, like there\u2019s maybe a Patreon out there for you guys, is all I\u2019m saying. (Laughter.) Like, I would definitely listen to that. I\u2019m just saying I would subscribe.\n\nAll right, that is all the time that we have for this episode.
