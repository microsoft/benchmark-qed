{"episode": "EP-67 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Ben Laude", "text": "BEN LAUDE: Maybe one day we will be sort of comparing Horowitz and Perahia\u2019s Chopin Ballade to AI\u2019s different version of it. And we can input, well, I want \u2013 I want to hear an AI sort of play it \u2013 play it with this kind of expression. Is that coming? Should \u2013 should we be concerned, or what do you think?\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer and EVP of AI at Microsoft.  \nToday, tech is part of nearly every aspect of our lives. We\u2019re in the early days of an AI revolution promising to transform our lived experiences as much as any technology ever has. On this podcast, we\u2019ll talk with the folks behind that technology and explore the motivations, passion, and curiosity driving them to create the tech shaping our world. Let\u2019s get started.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello, and welcome to Behind The Tech. I\u2019m cohost, Christina Warren, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Now, before we introduce our guest, we wanted to take a minute to share with you all that we are planning an Ask Me Anything, or AMA episode with Kevin in the coming months. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, that\u2019s right. We would love to hear your questions on any topic at all, from AI to sci-fi to woodworking, or my latest obsession, which is pottery. So, funny enough, as we are recording this, I have a kiln heating up to many thousands of degrees Fahrenheit right now, firing pottery; or we could talk about piano, which is the episode that we\u2019re recording today. So, anything that\u2019s on your mind, please feel free to reach out to us and, like, we will try to give good answers to your good questions. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, absolutely. I\u2019m really, really excited to see what questions come in. If you have a question for Kevin, you can send us an e-mail or voice note to BehindTheTech@microsoft.com. That\u2019s BehindTheTech@microsoft.com. And please include your name and a way to reach out if you have follow up questions. And please keep voice notes to no longer than 90 seconds. Once again, that e-mail is BehindTheTech@microsoft.com. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome, I\u2019m really looking forward to that. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Me, too. Okay, now we can dive into our interview for today, which I\u2019m really looking forward to. \n\nSo, our guest today is a musician. Ben Laude is a concert pianist who has performed all over the world, and he\u2019s also a longtime music educator, both in traditional education settings and as a YouTube creator. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Look, I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m breaking news here, but I tend to get obsessed about, like, very particular things, And, like, one of the things that I\u2019ve been obsessed about since I was a teenager is classical piano. So, I\u2019m just super excited, in general, to talk to Ben, because I think he\u2019s making some of the best educational content about classical piano anywhere in the world. And it\u2019s a \u2013 just sort of a miracle that these resources are available for folks who happen to have this particular obsession. \n\nBut, you know, I think it\u2019s actually more relevant even than, you know, satisfying my desire to have a conversation with a fellow piano nerd, because we\u2019re at this point in time where people are thinking a lot about what AI means for art and artists. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I think that there is a bunch of stuff that we can chat about with Ben to try to get a little clearer in our head about what maybe things like AI are going to mean for art. And, you know, it\u2019s sort of a hard conversation to have in general, because I think if you ask 100 artists to define what art is like, you would get 100 different definitions. \n\nAnd so, like, you know, but it is one of the most essentially human things that we have as a species, is, like, the art that we make for ourselves and for each other. And so, I\u2019m, like, really excited to have this conversation with Ben, given that he\u2019s thought so critically about what makes the performance of classical piano, like, a compelling thing. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Absolutely, absolutely. I\u2019m really, really looking forward to this conversation, so let\u2019s go over to Ben.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Ben Laude is an adjunct professor of music, piano, literature and aural skills at Utah State University, and a YouTube creator devoted to popularizing classical piano content. He\u2019s an accomplished concert pianist whose playing has been described by The New York Times as superb in pace, tone and eloquence. He was the head of the Tonebase piano platform for four years, and he\u2019s currently working on a video and podcast series exploring the work of composer Frederick Chopin and his relevance to the 21st century. Ben holds degrees in piano performance from Rice University and the Juilliard School. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Ben, thank you so much for joining us on the podcast today. I\u2019ve been really looking forward to this one.\n\nBEN LAUDE: Thanks, Kevin. Likewise.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, you know, we always start these conversations by going back to people\u2019s beginnings. So, you\u2019re obviously, you know, an amazing piano and music educator and a performer. How did you get onto that journey? Like, when did you know that this is what you wanted to do? \n\nBEN LAUDE: Well, unlike some of my peers in the classical music world, I didn\u2019t come from a strictly musical family. So, there was music in my family, though. My dad is kind of dabbled at the piano, but he, himself, is a chemistry professor and administrator at UT Austin. \n\nSo, I grew up in the suburbs of Austin, Texas, you know, middle class. And parents split up, but, you know, basically I had a normal, normal sort of 1990s childhood, early Internet, lots of TV, sports. And a little bit of Chopin and Beethoven started filling the air around me. At night my dad would come home from his lab and, you know, try his hand at the beginning of Chopin\u2019s first nocturne. And so, this intoxicating melody just sort of, I guess, seeped into my nervous system. \n\nReportedly, I don\u2019t remember this exactly, reportedly, I would come and stare at my dad when he would try to play. And eventually, I think it was pretty clear I needed to start piano lessons around age five. But in terms of how I ended up here, I mean, lots of people take piano lessons, but, like I usually say, you\u2019re supposed to quit around age 11 or 12. You\u2019re not supposed to keep doing it. (Laughter.) That\u2019s weird. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter.) Yeah. \n\nBEN LAUDE: So, I got really lucky, or you could say unlucky, depending on whether you think a career in music is a good idea, but I got really lucky. And right around high school, I got a new teacher who actually set my technique straight. You know, I had maybe some talent before, but it wasn\u2019t really realized. Again, I had a lot of other priorities. I wasn\u2019t being pushed to become some kind of virtuoso. \n\nSo, there was a turning point around 8th or 9th Grade. I was starting to feel something for the music, you know?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yep. \n\nBEN LAUDE: In fact, it was a Chopin prelude I remember listening to in the 8th Grade. Suddenly, and again, this is right around early puberty, right, so hormones are starting. So, one of the many things that happened in early puberty was this music started to matter to me. You know, I felt something new and different and not exactly something I wanted to go brag to my friends about at school. So, it became this private obsession,\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nBEN LAUDE: and I just became a ravenous collector of music scores and piano recordings. And I wanted to get better. I started practicing more. And, you know, I went from playing with flat fingers and barely making my way through a Bach Invention in middle school to playing Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Rachmaninoff concertos by my sophomore and junior year of high school. \n\nSo, there was this kind of great leap that happened that was also happening at the same time that my interest in the art form was being stimulated. And so, I was lucky to have a father and a mother who were encouraging when I told them, \u201cI want to be a pianist. (Laughter.) I want to go study this in college.\u201d So, that\u2019s how it all got started, in a nutshell. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, how important do you think that feedback loop is to people, like, getting escape velocity into a profession? So, like what you described that you started, you had a new teacher, you know, like, I sort of wonder how important the Internet, you know, was to, like, finding community to fuel your obsession. But, like, you know, it sounds like the important thing is, like, this sort of feedback loop where all of a sudden, like, you just started progressing faster, and, like, feeling better, and you know, differently about the things that you were doing. \n\nLike, I felt the same way when I was young about programming. Like, I\u2019ve got a daughter right now who\u2019s 16, who\u2019s, like, in the feedback loop for, you know, the biosciences. And, like, it\u2019s just kind of cool to see that hit someone.\n\nBEN LAUDE: Nothing has ever made me feel the way Chopin nocturnes and polonaises and Beethoven sonatas, you know, made me feel, or Rachmaninoff concertos started to make me feel in high school. I don\u2019t know how to describe it. I don\u2019t feel the way now that I felt then. I wish I could go back and experience that magic again, but it\u2019s, you know \u2013 I feel, like, the world\u2019s been a bit disenchanted for me as I grow older. And so, maybe some of my videos are an attempt to reenchant things for myself, too, you know?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nBEN LAUDE: But at the time, I mean, I just started become \u2013 I always had obsessions as a kid. I would become fixated on some aspect of culture or subject, and piano, in a way, was just another one of those, but because it was so much deeper than, say, my obsession with yo-yos or juggling, with no offense to those performing arts, but piano has a rich history and legacy, and it\u2019s just infinitely deep. \n\nAnd I was also just fascinated by the fact that these encoded scores could be manifest in sound, you know, if that makes any sense. It\u2019s like some guy wrote this down 200 years ago in hieroglyphics, and I\u2019m able to decipher it and then bring it to life? I mean, it was just \u2013 that was magical to me. That was really cool to me. And so, this obsession just \u2013 I think, because I got a good teacher, that teacher was able to push me and develop it. It could have just been another passing phase or fad for me, but it \u2013 something clicked, and it really \u2013 and it\u2019s all I cared about for a bit there. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, I\u2019m just sort of curious. Like, you, in one of your videos, you know, you\u2019re, like, holding up video cassettes of, you know, like, the, you know, Horowitz Last Romantic and, you know, like, you\u2019re talking about the \u201878 performance of the Rach 3 that he did. \n\nAnd, yeah, I had a whole bunch of those reference points when I was a kid. Like, I think I\u2019m a reasonable bit older than you are. And so, like, growing up in the \u201870s and \u201880s, like, I got connected to classical music because Horowitz was a little bit of a celebrity, like, not a huge celebrity, like, mainstream-wise, But, like, yeah, he had done this televised concert from Carnegie Hall in 1968 that, like, you know, was before I was born, but, like, got replayed. \n\nAnd then I remember, he did this interview on 60 Minutes, like, I believe, right when he was about to do his tour of Moscow. And, like, there was a little bit of this sort of Cold War dimension where, you know, it\u2019s like, oh, our pianists are better than your pianists at that point in time. \n\nAnd it was just enough to get me super fascinated, you know, by this, which, you know, was just as weird for me to be fascinated as, you know, it probably was, you know, for you. I was the only kid in my circle who was listening to Vladimir Horowitz and Vladimir Ashkenazy and, you know, Van Cliburn \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 Martha Argerich CDs or, you know, cassette tapes, even before CDs existed. \n\nBut, like, you know, was how did you find community, or, you know, it sounds like you had good teachers. But was there anything else, because this is one of the things I think you\u2019re doing an extraordinary job of, is, like, you know, giving these resources for people who have this fascination? \n\nBEN LAUDE: Yeah. I mean, in a way, I\u2019m just creating videos for my younger self that I wish had existed back then. But, yeah, I probably wouldn\u2019t be here without the early Internet, which you probably feel some nostalgia for that early Internet as well. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nBEN LAUDE: I mean, again, my father is a professor, so I grew up crawling around his lab in the mid-90s. And we had the Internet. \n\nAnd so, around then, I was probably playing video games with my brother. And we would get online and look up Internet, you know, sort of Resident Evil cheat codes for PlayStation, things like that. But message boards were sort of the main, at least for me, thing to do on the Internet in the late \u201890s and early 2000s. And it was around 2000 that I developed this piano obsession. \n\nAnd so, of course, I ran to get online, dial up and look for somebody saying something about piano. And I found it. There was an old site called The Chopin Files that \u2013 when I was in high school. Then it became defunct. And then I found a couple other sites. One\u2019s called Piano World and Piano Street. They still exist. \n\nSo, I went on there and just started talking a bunch of smack about piano, because I was developing opinions. And I would hear somebody \u2013 you know, I heard somebody else claim that Horowitz is 1951 Rachmaninoff 3rd Concerto is obviously superior to his earlier and later renditions. And Martha Argerich\u2019s Rach 3 is too indulgent here. \n\nAnd so, of course, they\u2019re all received. They weren\u2019t my own opinions, and I was kind of trying on different thought, you know. But I asserted myself with confidence, and I found message boards to have these kinds of fun debates. And, you know, ranking the Chopin etudes to see what was hardest. But, yeah, I needed that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Which one do you think\u2019s the hardest? \n\nBEN LAUDE: Well, I\u2019ve \u2013 I mean, I think it\u2019s personal, but for me, it\u2019s either the double-thirds \u00c9tude or the Opus 10, No. 2 in A minor, where you have to, in your third, fourth and fifth fingers, play a rapid chromatic scale while also accompanying yourself, basically an oom-pa-pa in the same hand as this insane spidery thing. \n\nSo, at the time, I was just \u2013 I couldn\u2019t touch these pieces. I was still getting better, and I was in awe of those who could. And I wanted to find everybody I could who had the same fascination for me. And without the Internet, I wouldn\u2019t have done that and also without video. \n\nIn my pre-YouTube era, when the Internet was helping to stimulate this interest, I had to find \u2013 I needed to watch these things. And I could listen, because I could go to Barnes & Noble to the CD section and sort of buy some, or even Tower Records was around back then. I could buy some classical CDs, and I would collect them with whatever, you know, little bit of money that I had in high school. That\u2019s what I splurged it all on, was just CDs and scores, but I wanted to watch these things.\n\nAnd I was lucky enough to catch something on PBS at some point about Evgeny Kissin. And I remember, my teacher had a couple of VHS tapes that he let me borrow, and a DVD. And one of them was a documentary called The Art of Piano \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, amazing.\n\nBEN LAUDE: \u2013 which chronicled all the sort of famous pianists of the 20th century. And that was the first time I heard of people, like Arrau, Horowitz, Serkin, Gould, and some of the early golden age \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s the first time I ever heard of Cziffra, right? \n\nBEN LAUDE: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 who, like, is unbelievable. (Laughter.) \n\nBEN LAUDE: And then, but also, to see it was a big deal, like, to \u2013 and there was something, there was an aura around these old videos. And now they\u2019re all \u2013 everything is on YouTube. I mean, every day, I get recommended a new \u2013 you know, it\u2019s not video, but a new Carnegie Hall recital from Horowitz in the \u201840s. I mean, he played there, like, probably a handful of times every year. There\u2019s dozens of these things that exist, but as a kid, just to have one live recording of Horowitz from Carnegie Hall was, you know, would make me flip out. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nBEN LAUDE: So, I really needed the Internet, and I needed video. (Laughter.) And the couple years before YouTube, I mean, YouTube was such a game changer for this obsession.\n\nAnd it was like \u2013 it came right at the time I was in college, when my obsession was peaking. But in the years before that, I found random websites. One was called rareclassicaldvds.com, and I needed it in particular because I wanted to get my hands on a particular Horowitz performance that apparently was a total bust in Tokyo. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, yeah.\n\nBEN LAUDE: He was, you know, mixing medications, and he just completely but I was fascinated by the fact that Horowitz, you know, screwed up. I was like, I have to hear this performance. So, you know, but I also ordered the \u2013 before it was available, I ordered some, you know, some Horowitz in Moscow, you know, DVDs like that. \n\nSo, I had this obsession. Again, nobody except my piano teacher, maybe in his younger years, cared about this. There was actually nowhere I could find anyone. I wasn\u2019t going to school and trying to convince people to like this thing I liked. I played on the basketball team. Again, I was just kind of whatever. That \u2013 it was something I tried to hide, to be honest. \n\nAnd so, yeah, the Internet was a place for me to go and find a community of likeminded people. And actually, it was amazing. When I started my channel, I got a sort of early Patreon supporter. And the guy reached out, and he\u2019s some kind of business or finance guy about around my age. And he said, \u201cHey, you know, I remember you from the piano forums in the 2000s. You know, I was Alkan88.\u201d And I was like, \u201cI remember that.\u201d (Laughter.) \n\nSo, these people I met at the time with these pseudonyms are coming back into my life now and finding my work, you know? So, it\u2019s sort of coming full circle, I suppose. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, how did you \u2013 you know, if you\u2019re playing Rachmaninoff concertos when you\u2019re in high school, you\u2019re super talented. You know, it sounds like you had, like, all the passion that you need to decide to go to school to study. Like, how did you think about this as a career? Was \u2013 were you just purely driven by the passion for this thing, or did you have, like, these rational thoughts about, you know, like, okay, this is what the odds are of, like, you know, being, you know, a concert pianist, like, in this world?\n\nBEN LAUDE: For better or worse, my dad raised me with a sort of almost American dream kind of mentality of, you know, that you can be whatever you want to be in this country. And while I don\u2019t think that\u2019s exactly as true as maybe he was making it seem, it \u2013 I was lucky that, you know, he thought that. (Laughter.) \n\nAnd so, but for also, for that reason, I had no rational calculus at all. I mean, I \u2013 it was a matter of first getting a taste of the fact that this does go on in the real world. Remember, I\u2019d only been on the Internet. So, before I was going to commit myself to this, I had to meet people actually doing it. \n\nAnd so, luckily, between my junior and senior year of high school, I went to New Orleans Piano Institute camp. There\u2019s a competition that happens at the same time. And I went there, and it was like me and a couple other sort of high school-aged people, but a lot of college-age students a couple years older than me, who were studying piano in college. And I felt \u2013 you know, I felt like I was on their level, or at least near their level, and I loved it. I finally could just sort of, like, talk about my passion and my hobby and share it with them, and go to international competition every night and watch amazing pianists, maybe 5-10, years older than me, do their thing. \n\nAnd so, that made it real. I mean, that\u2019s when I was like, okay, people, you can do this. It\u2019s \u2013 there is a major in college. You can major in music. You can even major in piano. I still find it totally bizarre that that\u2019s a thing. And yet, you know, the moment that I \u2013 the moment that it became real to me, I think it was just instant. I was like, this is what I\u2019m doing. \n\nAnd college, again was \u2013 it was sold as a time to explore. I mean, it was a time to not have to decide. And so, even though music majors are the ones at Rice, where I went, who had to commit \u2013 we actually had to declare our major before we got there. Everybody else got a year or a year and a half or so. We were the ones who knew it.\n\nAt the same time, there was this feeling of, like, well, you know, I could always change my course. I was interested in math and other things. I even got into Northwestern for a double degree in math and music and ended up going to Rice. And so, I knew I had other interests and skills and could always turn, but I wasn\u2019t really thinking about that. I was just so happy that this career path existed. And I was so at the beginning of it that I wasn\u2019t thinking longer term. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it\u2019s a super interesting profession and a practice. So, like, someone asked me one time, I was on a\u2026 It was actually at a computer science conference with, you know, fellow PhD students. And, like, we were in Vancouver, and I went to, like, some Virgin Records in Vancouver. And, like, I actually found, like, The Art of Piano, like that DVD there, and I, like, bought it. \n\nAnd they were like, \u201cWhy are you so fascinated with piano? Like, you\u2019re a computer scientist.\u201d (Laughter.) And I was like, I like, there\u2019s some part of it I can\u2019t explain at all. Like, I just \u2013 I have no idea, but, like, part of it is, like, I love this idea that pianists and programmers, like, share this struggle that they have, where you\u2019ve got this machine that doesn\u2019t really want to do what you want it to do \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 that you have to sit down at and conquer. I mean, like, you just have to figure out its complexities and figure out how to extract out of it, like, you know, what you have in your head.\n\nAnd, like, it\u2019s a little bit of a solitary activity. Like, you know, that act of, you know, mastering this tool, like, no one can do for you. And, like, there are very few shortcuts for accelerating it. Like, you\u2019ve just got to put hours in. And I always, like, I even heard, I think, on The Last Romantic, one of these Horowitz, you know, VHS tapes that I watch, like, Horowitz\u2019s manager described it. \n\nHe was like, \u201cYeah, you know, pianists have \u2013 you know, sometimes can have this strange psyche, because what they do is a solitary activity. Like, they sit alone in a room and wrestle with this great machine.\u201d (Laughter.) \n\nBEN LAUDE: Sure. First of all, you really know your stuff. I mean, you know all of these great documentaries and \u2013 and performances of classical piano. So, I\u2019m impressed and flattered to know that \u2013 that you like a thing I like. \n\nBut yeah, I \u2013 you\u2019re absolutely right. I think Martha Argerich once said that, you know, her solo recitals just felt like the loneliest time in the world. It \u2013 that\u2019s not every pianist. I mean, Arthur Rubinstein was very much present with his audience. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nBEN LAUDE: And, you know, I think he said that he would even imagine a pretty girl in the audience and play for her, but he loved to share in live performance. And I think I\u2019m more on the Argerich or even Gouldian side of things of, frankly, it wasn\u2019t concerts that got me into music. It was recordings, and it was a very private activity. In fact, I still feel uncomfortable when I go to live concerts. Everybody\u2019s around me. Can you guys leave? Can I just be in here alone? So, because it is a private experience for the listener as well. \n\nBut as a pianist, I mean, just sitting in a room for hours on end, it is, I suppose, similar to programming. There\u2019s an input and an output, and the output is not always what you want. And there\u2019s something going on in the inside, and there\u2019s probably bugs in there, and who knows? But I like piano because, compared with other instruments, which I never got into, although now I regret that \u2013 I wish I were more diverse in my instrumental skill sets the way musicians used to have to be, but I am a pianist, only one week of string camp. Can\u2019t remember any of that, but I like that the pianist is detached from the production of sound and that that\u2019s actually invisible to us. \n\nNow, this could be a trap for pianists who start approaching piano too much like a kind of typing or button pressing activity, you know?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nBEN LAUDE: But actually, your connection \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s such an ingenious design, you know, from the early industrial revolution, that your actual physical activity is immediately triggering this, you know, hammer action, complex hammer action and escapement on the inside of the instrument. And so, but you can\u2019t see that. So, all you have is this, you know, interface. And you have to sort of, like, develop a kind of connection with that. \n\nAnd it\u2019s really hard, and I\u2019m still trying to do it better. And I\u2019m trying to help other people do it better, but I think the biggest difference between piano and coding, because otherwise they have a lot of interesting similarities, the solitary nature, it\u2019s just the physical and athletic requirement. \n\nI mean, at the end of the day, piano is an intense physical activity. We\u2019re all injured. We don\u2019t like to talk about it, but we\u2019re all injured. And maybe you coder types get a little injured sometimes, you know, maybe a little like, oh, my neck hurts, or something. You need some occupational therapy. But pianists, like, actually, we need serious, like, help sometimes with this, so.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and I forget what the story is like. Didn\u2019t Schumann, like, wreck his hands, like, because he made these little exercise, like \u2013 \n\nBEN LAUDE: Yeah. So, there was \u2013 they didn\u2019t know much about piano technique in the 19th century. The people who did it well, I think, sort of figured it out naturally. And so, they had all kinds of ridiculous ideas, like, he was trying to get independence in his fourth finger. And the fourth finger is conjoined. Chopin said it was the Siamese, these are the Siamese twins of the hand. I mean, they\u2019re sort of conjoined right here. And so, what he thought was, like, he needed a contraption to learn how to isolate each finger. \n\nWell, it turns out, you know, we know this a lot now, also from research in the 20th century, that isolating your fingers is basically a ticket to having a career ending, debilitating injury. And so, that\u2019s what happened to Schumann. He came up with this contraption to try to help isolate the fourth finger, and it ended up ruining him, contributing in part to his misery, although it\u2019s good to have miserable composers because of the music. You know, it\u2019s, like, dark. (Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: He squeezed some beautiful, beautiful stuff out of the misery.\n\nBEN LAUDE: You don\u2019t want too happy a composer. You know, Chopin was just so melancholy all the time. (Laughter.) And would we have wanted him to be different? I mean, maybe. Maybe we\u2019d want Chopin to be happy, but we\u2019re okay with the results he put into his music. \n\nBut yeah, for sure, there\u2019s a lot more knowledge now about what to do and what not to do with the hand, although I still think not enough. And it\u2019s not standardized, and there\u2019s still a lot more research that needs to be done into it. And there\u2019s a lot of gurus and a lot of schools of thought, and they all have their dogmas. \n\nAnd so, actually, part of my work at Tonebase was just kind of trying to collect these people and say, let\u2019s get what these, you know, different experts are saying about piano technique, and what\u2019s interesting is how often they disagree with each other. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\n\nBEN LAUDE: So, it\u2019s still a heated debate, but at least we know that we shouldn\u2019t be tying or putting our finger in these contraptions anymore. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it really is interesting. I mean, like, I\u2019m not surprised at all that you have people having wildly different opinions about interpretation. So, and, like, I, one of the weird things I do, like, God bless YouTube. Like, I do think it is actually one of the most wonderful things ever, not just for piano nerds, but, you know, any sort of nerd, like you want to go obsess on something.\n\nBut, you know, like, I watched, just this morning, you know, preparing for this, I want to talk about the \u2013 I want to talk about the\u2026 you know, the instrument and the art as, like, you know two different things, because I think, you know, when you think about something like AI, like, if you think about, you know, AI as both instrument and art together, like, you just are getting confused. But if you think about AI as an instrument for an artist to use to go make something, it becomes altogether interesting.\n\nAnd so, I was watching this morning, Murray Perahia doing a master class in 2022 on the G minor Ballade, Chopin, which is my favorite piece of music. And Murray, like, one of his performances is my very favorite performance of that. And, you know, there\u2019s a \u2013 you know, the part of that ballade that is \u2013 that moves me the most is, like, the lead up to bar 106, you know? So, like, you know, when you release all of the tension, it\u2019s like that double fortissimo. It\u2019s the big dramatic moment in the middle of the piece. \n\nAnd what he was asking this student to do is, like, there\u2019s this chord in the lead up to 106. And he\u2019s like, \u201cWhat does death sound like?\u201d (Laughter.) And he\u2019s like, \n\u201cThis is death.\u201d And he\u2019s like, you know, \u201cYou need to, like, have this passage, this line that you\u2019re playing, you know, like, be foreboding and, like, as if death is chasing you.\u201d\n\nAnd not everybody has that in their mind, like, when they\u2019re playing that particular passage. Like, I know Zimmerman\u2019s got a different thing. I\u2019ve seen \u2013 seen Steven Hough do a master class on the same thing.\n\nAnd so, like, that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s just super fascinating to me. It\u2019s like, you can have the same instrument and the same score and, like, get something fundamentally different out of it for you, the performer. And it, like, lands on the audience in a different way. Like, Murray\u2019s performance of this, like, gives me \u2013 like, it sends goosebumps up my spine every time I listen to it. I\u2019ve listened to it hundreds of times. You know, Zimmerman\u2019s performances are, like, very, very good. It just doesn\u2019t do the same thing. And I don\u2019t know why. I can\u2019t explain it.\n\nBEN LAUDE: It\u2019s also interesting that there\u2019s almost no spoilers in classical music. It\u2019s almost the reverse. It\u2019s knowing what\u2019s coming that builds the anticipation and the goosebumps. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes!\n\nBEN LAUDE: And for me, it\u2019s knowing a piece really well that makes, if it\u2019s a great piece, that makes repeated listenings so meaningful. But yeah, it\u2019s interesting to compare what you\u2019re describing to AI. And you would know much more about this than I would, but at least from what I can tell, classical piano and the literature and the art of interpreting it, I mean, these are expressions of human consciousness. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\n\nBEN LAUDE: And Chopin\u2019s first Ballade is an expression of his organized consciousness, and he\u2019s expressing something. And the only way we can agree about the piece is if we just speak in generalities. Well, it\u2019s dramatic. It seems to tell a story, whatever. But the moment you get into details and you want to talk about how this phrase should be rendered, it\u2019s death for Murray Perahia. It\u2019s life affirming for somebody else. It\u2019s dark for this interpreter. It\u2019s bright. I mean, it\u2019s dry for Glenn Gould, it\u2019s wet for Horowitz, right? It\u2019s \u2013 suddenly the interpreter\u2019s consciousness is then mixed with the composer\u2019s, and you get a new cocktail of whatever thing we can\u2019t describe, you know? \n\nAnd, yeah, I mean, maybe one day we will be sort of comparing Horowitz and Perahia\u2019s Chopin Ballade to AI\u2019s different version of it. And we can input, well, I want to hear an AI sort of play it with this kind of expression. I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019m not \u2013 you might have a comment on that. Is that coming? Should we be concerned, or what do you think? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: No, no. Look, I\u2019ve had this conversation with people, and I don\u2019t think it does, because I think the point of a thing like classical piano is you have something inside of you that you\u2019re trying to express that\u2019s difficult or impossible to express any other way. And it\u2019s, like, part of, you know, your humanity. And you are \u2013 you know, it has meaning if you just play it for yourself, and it has a different meaning if you play it for an audience, who are going to receive it in probably a different way than you are maybe even intending when you play it. \n\nBEN LAUDE: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, I\u2019d never thought of death before hearing Murray\u2019s performance until I saw him teach that master class. So, like, that\u2019s not the thing I\u2019m thinking of. It\u2019s like, you know, just this incredible emotional response that I get to it that I can\u2019t really put words on. And, like, I think that\u2019s a beautiful connection that, you know, you\u2019ve made, even though maybe that\u2019s not even what he was intending to do. \n\nBEN LAUDE: Yeah. Well, the whole question of composers\u2019 intentions is vexed, but I think it\u2019s interesting, what you said, because I could also change your mind. I mean, one of the things about my videos is I think I\u2019ve converted a few people to Glenn Gould, who would have never thought that they would want to listen to him. But also, you know, I made these videos about Yunchan Lim \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Except for Seymour Hoffman. You did not change his mind. (Laughter.) \n\nBEN LAUDE: Seymour Bernstein, yeah, but he did \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Bernstein, sorry.\n\nBEN LAUDE: He did \u2013 well, Philip Seymour Hoffman, RIP, but Seymour Bernstein\u2019s still kicking at 97. Didn\u2019t change his mind, but he did respect my sort of longer Gould documentary that I made a few months ago. And I, you know, was able to have an exchange with him, but that\u2019s \u2013 I loved having that debate with Seymour \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\n\nBEN LAUDE: \u2013 because we were able to sort of distill two perfectly valid conceptions and approaches and ways of regarding the playing of Mozart, Brahms and Bach. For me, I was \u2013 well, so he gave the argument on personal feeling. For him, Glenn Gould fails in terms of connecting with his sense of the way one should touch and turn these phrases so that they speak from the heart. \n\nAnd I kind of said back to him, \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right. He doesn\u2019t speak from the heart. Gould is up to something else.\u201d I mean, he\u2019s trying to design these sort of, you know, almost sonic, aural landscapes that are organic and speak on their own terms, and aren\u2019t related to our personal feelings, but somehow float above us. They\u2019re sort of part of the cosmos. They\u2019re hypnotic. They\u2019re often \u2013 they have a kind of regularity to them, and it feels like the universe is pulsating and that we\u2019re just sort of attaching ourselves to. It\u2019s a very different esthetic experience and listening to music than wanting to be touched, wanting to be moved and feel. \n\nSo, that\u2019s what\u2019s great about it. You can feel all kinds of things up here and here and here.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nBEN LAUDE: And then when we have discussions and debates, it\u2019s not about being right, it\u2019s about learning more about what it means to feel something personally, or what it might mean to experience art in a different way. \n\nAnd just the comments on those videos about Gould, and I\u2019d say about Yunchan, too, I mean, even \u2013 not everybody thought Yunchan\u2019s performance was the greatest Rachmaninoff of all time. And they let me know it in the comments, but it became even more interesting because I got to see what was I \u2013 you know, what did I hear that made me like it so much? \n\nAnd then I had to examine my own biases and my own influences. And I realized some people are expecting something completely different from this piece.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nBEN LAUDE: And that\u2019s where just it becomes about this human interchange and human exchange of ideas. And so, yeah, perhaps, if an AI sort of interfered with that, they would be just a nuisance. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it is sort of a \u2013 I mean, like, a couple of things that, you know, what you just said made me think, like, one is, like, I think artists, like Glenn Gould and Horowitz is the same way. And part of what makes them exciting to me is, like, they\u2019re not consistent across their performances of the same repertoire. \n\nLike, there\u2019s this Glenn Gould performance of Bach\u2019s Italian Concerto, where, you know, like, 3rd Movement, like, he\u2019s playing, like, at this rip roaring tempo. \n\nBEN LAUDE: Bat out of hell, yeah. (Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And that\u2019s the one that I love. Like, I like \u2013 I find it incredibly compelling. And then later on in life, you know, he\u2019s, like, plays it at, like, what must be just half the tempo that he was playing in that, you know, younger recording. And it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t care for it, But, like, he\u2019s evidently had some reconceiving of, you know, like, what it is he\u2019s looking for in the score.\n\nBEN LAUDE: Yeah, he did it with the Italian Concerto, but most famously with the Goldberg Variations. And then that\u2019s what he sort of launched his career with. But then he reflected on his own interpretation, and he realized this isn\u2019t so organic. It doesn\u2019t add up. He says, it just sounds like 30 independent variations with the mind of their own. \n\nAnd Gould had a kind of modernist sensibility. He believed in the autonomy of art. He believed that it should somehow all sort of operate on its own logic and its own terms. And to have a kind of variety show was, you know, something too much out of the mundane world. He wanted the Goldberg Variations to somehow, again, float above our human engagement with it and therefore proceed from one variation to the next with a kind of mathematical proportionality. \n\nAnd he mapped this all out. And for some people, they can hear that sort of measured quality, and it\u2019s totally alienating. It sounds like maybe that might have been your experience. I love that. I think that the fact that he starts with one pulse and he takes it for an hour, and he travels through this whole, you know, spiral of variations, and then he comes back to the beginning, and somehow you felt like it was one thing, that\u2019s just a towering achievement, you know, so.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Oh, I love his Goldberg Variations as well. It\u2019s just, you know, Horowitz, for many, many, many, many years, was by far and away my favorite pianist. And, like, he\u2019s still \u2013 my single favorite piece of music, and my single favorite performance of it is his. So, it\u2019s Scriabin\u2019s Opus 8, No. 12. So, like, the D minor \u00c9tude.\n\nBEN LAUDE: D#, D# Minor.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: D#, sorry.\n\nBEN LAUDE: Not a key that you want to touch. It\u2019s very prickly. (Laughter.) Yeah. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And his performance in that 1968 televised concert is, like, I think, like, the most compelling thing I\u2019ve ever heard. And it\u2019s \u2013 \n\nBEN LAUDE: Well, that\u2019s a piece \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 that performance is part of the reason I\u2019m a pianist. I mean, that exact performance of that exact piece, when I first saw it, also just something about the color of that old, you know, CBS live performance from behind the piano, and he comes out with the strong bass. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s funny \u2013 \n\nBEN LAUDE: And it\u2019s one of the most rhapsodic, passionate, you know, pieces I\u2019d ever \u2013 I\u2019d never heard of Scriabin before, and I was an immediate convert when I saw that. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nBEN LAUDE: Sorry to interrupt you, but I have to, just because it relates to something you said before. That piece, I took \u2013 I had to learn it because of Horowitz, just like I had to learn the Goldberg Variations, because \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, God help you. (Laughter.) \n\nBEN LAUDE: Well, yeah. And actually, I thought, this \u2013 there\u2019s no way I can play it. But in college, again, I had the time to be crazy enough to sit down and figure out how to make all those left hand jumps work. And it\u2019s good that it\u2019s in D# Minor, because that means you\u2019re almost exclusively playing black keys, which on the page, looks frightening. But if you just look at the keyboard and you forget about how all this is notated, it\u2019s actually more comfortable in certain ways to use the black keys that way. \n\nAnd so, these jumps started to fit, and I realized I could redistribute some with my right hand. And I just needed to basically master a couple of challenging octave parts. And I was starting to do my best Horowitz interpretation or impression. \n\nI took this piece to Jerry Lowenthal, one of my teachers at Juilliard, and he hadn\u2019t heard me play it before. And I was about to play it on the radio somewhere, and I just wanted to run it for him. And I come in, and I start with the Horowitz, just bashing the left hand octaves, ba-dum, dee-da-da, you know, just cacophony. \n\nAnd he stops me. \u201cAh, ah, stop, stop, stop! Why does everyone have to try to play this like Horowitz?\u201d he said. And he showed me. He said, you know, it \u2013 \u201cFirst of all, there\u2019s no dynamic indication at the beginning. And you can start very quietly, and it\u2019s extremely effective.\u201d \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nBEN LAUDE: Later on, I saw, there\u2019s a later Horowitz performance, I think, in London \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\n\nBEN LAUDE: \u2013 where he starts, plays the same piece, and he begins at almost pianissimo. So, even Horowitz did the opposite, right? And so, here I was, imitating Horowitz, but I was actually just imitating one performance that he gave. \n\nWow. We\u2019re really nerding out about this. I hope your viewers are down. If you don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about, guys, go watch Vladimir Horowitz play Scriabin D# Minor \u00c9tude, Opus 8, No. 12 immediately from 1968.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Yeah, it is incredible, which, you know, sort of brings me to Yunchan Lim, which I think is a thing that, you know, folks who are not familiar. Like, they should definitely go to YouTube or to, like, their favorite streaming platform or whatnot, And, like, start listening to some of the work by this kid. \n\nAnd it\u2019s, you know, yet again, one of these things that really makes me believe that there\u2019s just something very deeply human about this art form that I think people can get very confused about, you know, because, like, you\u2019ve got a technical instrument and, like, a very technical discipline of playing.\n\nBut, like, the thing that\u2019s miraculous about it is, like, the human piece of it. And, like, you know, what I\u2019m talking about, like, Yunchan Lim is, like, he\u2019s 20 years old now, maybe 21. \n\nBEN LAUDE: Just 20.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So, a couple of years ago, at the Van Cliburn piano competition, which is one of the world\u2019s, like, big piano competitions for young musicians to go prove themselves to the world, he wins the competition. And there\u2019s a concerto performance at this competition, and, like, everyone was performing the Rachmaninoff\u2019s third piano concerto. And he comes out and delivers this performance that was unbelievable, like, one where the conductor\u2019s, like, wiping a tear away from her eyes. You know, like, the orchestra that was playing with him, like, had this crazy reaction to the performance. And it\u2019s just unbelievable. \n\nLike, up until that point, like, that \u201878, you know, Ormandy performance that Horowitz had given was, like, my high watermark. And I changed my mind. It was like, you know, this thing for 50 years was, like, test of time, like, so many people thought it was the best. And then all of a sudden they\u2019re changing their opinion. And part of it, it was, like, the whole performance. Like, watching him play it was part of what made it compelling. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And look, so everyone should go watch your analysis of this performance, because I think it\u2019s the best one on the Internet, trying to explain why it is that this young man had done something extraordinary with a 100-year-old score and a multiple 100-years-old instrument that has been played a million times, recorded thousands of times, analyzed within an inch of its life by, like, very smart people and very great artists. And yet, you know, here he comes, and he does something new and surprising. Like, it\u2019s amazing.\n\nBEN LAUDE: There\u2019s an old romantic notion that music is ineffable. It expresses things that can\u2019t be expressed in words. And I think we agree that there\u2019s truth to that. You even said something that\u2019s similar, but it also, I think, has led to a deficit in good analysis and commentary, at least in popular mainstream, of music. There\u2019s a kind of fear of talking about what makes a performance great or interpretation great. It\u2019s almost like explaining a joke. It\u2019s like, \u201cno, don\u2019t do that.\u201d It\u2019s just supposed to hit us and then leave it alone. \n\nAnd I remember in college, somebody giving a lecture recital, and there was somebody sort of grumbling next to me. It\u2019s like, can\u2019t we just let the music speak for itself? You know, that\u2019s the thing you\u2019re supposed to say about it. And it\u2019s \u2013 I remember sort of being puzzled, because I was always overly analytic about everything. And here I am, not letting music speak for itself, but speaking way too much about music, but people really appreciated that. \n\nAnd I just took his performance, and I helped \u2013 first, I clarified it for myself. What did I \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\n\nBEN LAUDE: What made this connect with me? And then when I listened back and took all these notes on everything, I realized, oh, he was listening to Horowitz here, or I just \u2013 he sort of discovered an inner voice there. And it helped that I\u2019d just heard countless performances of this over the years, that I could sort of listen anew and hear somebody, on the one hand, synthesizing certain older interpretations, but also integrating them into his own new sort of take on it. \n\nAnd what was fun about what I did, and I think what people really appreciated, is they had this moving experience that they couldn\u2019t quite explain. And so, to have somebody else help clarify for them, what was so special about it made them want to relisten. And so, then when they relistened, and it got to those passages, they heard more. They actually heard it different. It was a different experience. \n\nI mean, we think, oh, I\u2019ve heard that piece before, or even I\u2019ve heard that recording before, but this music is way too rich. It\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s too much going on, there\u2019s too much polyphony. There\u2019s tens of thousands of notes. There\u2019s infinite ways that you could \u2013 a variety of ways of approaching it and phrasing it, that even just listening to the same recording, you\u2019re going to notice a new detail, or if you do know a detail is coming, you\u2019re going to enjoy it again in maybe a new way. \n\nAnd so, I was actually showing people that there\u2019s a way to listen to classical music that they hadn\u2019t experienced before, one that necessitates relistening, one that requires that you sort of notice things, become aware of them and appreciate when others point things out to you, because that\u2019s how I got into it. I had others be like, listen to this moment. You know, wait for it. Did you hear how they did \u2013 and so, I loved that kind of engagement with others. \n\nAnd YouTube is just, for me, the greatest opportunity to \u2013 platform to sort of create that. It also allows me to indulge my long standing interest in just creating video, creating content. I\u2019ve been editing videos since high school projects, you know? And finally, it\u2019s coming to good use. \n\nAnd so, now I get to design these things where I both clarify things for myself in these video essays and analyses, but also, I get to design the way it looks and how the score appears on the page. And I love editing the music, so it\u2019s like one performance will sync up suddenly with another performance. You know, almost you didn\u2019t hear it, but now that helps you hear the difference. Like, putting Horowitz and Argerich and Yunchan back to back to back, so it sounds, like, one seamless performance, but you can hear. You know, it helps just bring into relief what\u2019s so different about them.\n\nAnd I think I\u2019m just getting started. I\u2019m just starting to experiment with these techniques, and I think other people should do it, too. I want there to be a bigger ecosystem of media and classical music content creators. There\u2019s some great ones out there, but for the most part, what I\u2019m doing, I kind of feel like, again, feel pretty lonely about it, like I used to when I was just practicing Chopin by myself in the 9th Grade. \n\nSo, yeah, it\u2019s an exciting time, I think, to bring this otherwise thing we\u2019re nerding out about to a broader public. And I think a lot of people are interested in it. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think you\u2019re right. I mean, everyone I\u2019ve shown that Yunchan video that you made has, I think, done exactly what you were intending. So, they\u2019ve gone back and relistened to the performance, And, like, they\u2019ve heard something that they wouldn\u2019t have heard before. And, like, I\u2019ve been listening to classical piano 40 years now, and, like, it\u2019s even influenced the \u2013 you know, the way that I\u2019m listening to things,  which has been amazing. \n\nI don\u2019t know, have you heard \u2013 he just recently made his Brahms debut, and he did the Emperor. And, like, I think his encore was Bach\u2019s Siciliano. And it\u2019s \u2013 the Emperor was amazing. And, like, I\u2019ve listened to the Emperor like a bazillion times. And so, like, my \u2013 my default tactic before I\u2019m going to sink a half an hour into this thing as I jump forward to the 3rd Movement, and I\u2019m like, okay, are they going to disappoint me here? And if they don\u2019t, like, I\u2019ll go back to the beginning and listen to the whole thing, because I\u2019m just \u2013 \n\nBEN LAUDE: We have a lot in common. (Laughter.) I used to \u2013 actually, you mentioned the Horowitz Ormandy recording. I used to just fast forward to the last minute of that because it \u2013 he has the most thrilling last page ever, and the audience is going nuts before he finishes. I would just \u2013 it\u2019s like the \u2013 you know, in a way, it\u2019s like \u2013 it\u2019s totally wrong to experience the music that way. But at the same time, I didn\u2019t care. It\u2019s like \u2013 it\u2019s like fast forwarding to the sort of game winning home run, the walk off home run at the end. I\u2019m just reliving the highlight. \n\nI haven\u2019t heard his Emperor yet. I\u2019m excited to. I\u2019ve heard his 3rd and 4th Concertos, so.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I will tell you, like, again, you should go listen to it. You know, draw your own conclusions. I won\u2019t say too much about it, but, like, it is now my favorite performance of the Emperor. And by the fifth bar of the 3rd Movement, he\u2019s already doing something unusual. Like, he completely ignores the fortissimo dynamic marking on the fifth bar. Like, usually it\u2019s, dun-dun, da-da-dun-dun, you know, and, like, it repeats. And on the repeat, he plays it piano. And I\u2019m like, what is he going to do now? And so, then I\u2019m just, like, ready to be on the ride. (Laughter.) \n\nBEN LAUDE: And \u2013 and yet, it feels organic. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It does.\n\nBEN LAUDE: It doesn\u2019t feel gimmicky.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Nope.\n\nBEN LAUDE: And he\u2019s able to \u2013 I \u2013 I was \u2013 I was lucky enough to interview Marin Alsop for a video that hasn\u2019t come out yet, but she said something to this effect: Like, his rubatos are always surprising, and yet they seem right. They seem organic and natural. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nBEN LAUDE: There\u2019s a lot of surprising rubato, you know, the taking of time in musical phrasing that\u2019s not organic, that sounds affected or, you know, it doesn\u2019t communicate or express itself exactly how the pianist imagines. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard to know how to feel a phrase in just a way that\u2019s going to communicate with the audience, especially to do it in a new way. Most of our rubatos are just the conventional things our teacher told us to do.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nBEN LAUDE: Yunchan\u2019s like, you know, just barely stopped being a teenager a couple months ago, and he\u2019s discovering new ways of articulating. What\u2019s so great about his performances, especially in the fact that he\u2019s champion of Beethoven and Bach, right, not just Liszt and Rachmaninoff, but he goes back to the classics. He can play Baroque counterpoint like you\u2019ve never heard before. That allows a kind of clarity in the bigger romantic concertos that I think makes \u2013 this sort of separates him. \n\nAnd so, I\u2019m interested to hear his Beethoven. He has such fantastic rhythmic drive and tautness that anything he does, there\u2019s always a sense that, oh, that landed exactly where I wanted it to, you know? So, it\u2019s just extremely gratifying to hear him, because I\u2019m getting to know him better also as a pianist, right? I feel like I know him personally, because I\u2019ve heard him interpret so many different pieces. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nBEN LAUDE: And you\u2019re right, it\u2019s like \u2013 it\u2019s this sense of, I can\u2019t wait to hear what \u2013 Yunshan has to say about this piece. And you know you\u2019ve made it as a pianist when people want to hear your version of what\u2019s been played a million times, so.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, yeah, I am dying at this point to hear him do the G Minor Ballade. I mean, he\u2019ll record it at some point, and it will be interesting. \n\nBEN LAUDE: I\u2019m sure. Well, you know, next year is \u2013 he\u2019s playing the Goldberg Variations in Carnegie Hall. And so, I look forward to that. I got to hear his 24 \u2013 actually, he played all 27 of them \u2013 Chopin \u00c9tudes. He did the sort of extra three as well in Carnegie. And, yeah, I mean, it was phenomenal. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it\u2019s crazy. Like, I haven\u2019t heard him play live yet, but, like, I listened to the recording of those \u00e9tudes, and it\u2019s like \u2013 it\u2019s just pretty incredible, like, the new things. You did an interview with Manny Ax, where he was talking about Horowitz, where, you know, Ax was saying, like, hey, I think Horowitz could, like, hear things in a score that, like, we couldn\u2019t, And, like, he chose to put highlights on different things, or to, like, bring your attention to things that other performers don\u2019t. \n\nAnd I feel like Yunchan does that a lot, like with, you know, the, you know, Opus 9, No. 2 Nocturne, which, you know, is like a \u2013 like, I can play that piece, but, like, (laughter) \u2013  not like he did. (Laughter.) \n\nBEN LAUDE: Well, he finds secrets in it, you know, that nobody ever knew about before. I \u2013 a lot of this does come back to Bach. I\u2019m wearing the tee-shirt for a reason. When you play enough Bach, you start living inside different voices in a new way. You\u2019re not just listen \u2013 we\u2019re sort of trained in our culture to listen for melody, right? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nBEN LAUDE: And then there\u2019s melody, and then there\u2019s the band, and the band\u2019s sort of accompanying you. There\u2019s a rhythm and bass section. Anyone who wants to go be a \u2013 anyone who knows music and wants to be a musician, and they get into music, often they gravitate towards the bass, because they realize, you know, the secret is the bass is actually what everything grows from. But in Bach\u2019s time, there was still a kind of parity between voices. And he wrote every voice with integrity and autonomy. \n\nAnd so, when you practice enough of that, you have to learn how to give life to inner voices, because they are just as independent as the top voice. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\nSo, if, you know, you\u2019re playing fugues or canons or inventions or anything that Bach wrote, there\u2019s always this sense of like, wow, I have to, you know \u2013 there\u2019s no hierarchy here. There\u2019s just a sort of, like, interplay of equal voices. \n\nAnd unfortunately, Bach is not, I think, taught enough. It\u2019s not stressed enough as \u2013 as a \u2013 as a real art form pianists should aspire to \u2013 to be able to play in the highest way. It\u2019s more seen as, like, broccoli you\u2019re supposed to eat to be more nutritious, but Yunchan \u2013 he takes the three part inventions of Bach, and he makes him into little miracles. And so, he\u2019s able to create art out of this otherwise seemingly archaic Baroque counterpoint. And that gives him a foundation for playing all of this romantic music, or more recent music, because he has control over every element, every input that\u2019s going into a texture. \n\nAnd so, therefore, if it\u2019s an otherwise, you know, pleasant Chopin Nocturne, that\u2019s, what, just oom-pa-pa in the left hand and the melody in the right, he\u2019s discovering and showing you through his expert finger independence and ability to balance on just the right notes, to voice them in a way that suddenly allows them to emerge from a texture. That comes from his Bach training. It allows his Chopin to speak in an absolutely new way. \n\nAnd so, these are all things I want to make videos about, by the way. (Laughter.) I need to write these down. But this is the stuff that I want people to hear, because I have so much pleasure myself discovering them and hearing it myself. \n\nAnd so, it\u2019s nice to \u2013 do you have friends who \u2013 also, like, piano this much in your world? I don\u2019t know. Maybe it is kind of a thing in \u2013 the tech world, but.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I \u2013 have friends who are obsessed about different things. I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s quite as obsessed as I am, which is why I was excited to talk to you today. (Laughter.) \n\nYeah, but look, so here\u2019s maybe the way that I will say it. Like, I think that if you look at, you know, Martha Argerich, you know, playing a Liszt piano concerto, or, you know, Yunchan Lim doing, you know, some of these beautiful things with a Chopin nocturne, or you\u2019re watching some other, like, great feat of human performance, like Alex Honnold free soloing El Cap, or, like, I think there\u2019s just this beautiful thing about watching human beings do things that are, like, right at the ragged edge of human performance, and then doing them in a way where they show everybody else, like, the art of the possible and, like, something new and nuanced and interesting that you\u2019ve never seen before. \n\nAnd it\u2019s the thing where, you know, like in my world, you know, where we get into these debates about what the role of technology is in making art, like, I always come down on the side that, you know, art is about the artist and the audience. It\u2019s not about the instrument, you know, because, like, piano was, like, new technology at some point. \n\nAnd, you know, the art that comes from AI is only going to be as interesting as the artists who are able to, like, say something new and interesting and human with it. Like, absent that, it\u2019s like, you know, just, it\u2019s like a phenomenon that you\u2019re observing and, like, it just doesn\u2019t have a human element. And I think things that don\u2019t have human elements are, like, very different than, you know, things like a, you know, performance that does.\n\nBEN LAUDE: Yeah, I think the instrument, in that sense, is somewhat trivial. It\u2019s what humans do with it. On the other hand, there\u2019s something special about the particular mechanical invention of the piano, and I would say the perfection of that instrument in the sort of late 19th, early 20th century, right around the same time the bicycle, I think, was being perfected and has never changed. \n\nAnd even if we have motorized bikes or AI riding bikes for us, self-driving bikes, we\u2019re also still going to get on it and pedal, because there\u2019s just something perfect about how that technology is integrated into a human form. You know, there\u2019s something so human about riding a bike. There\u2019s something so human about playing the piano. So, in that sense, that older technology really did, I think, peak in terms of mating with human beings. (Laughter.) And you don\u2019t need some singularity to achieve that. \n\nSo, I do want to, sort of, you know, say that perhaps some technology doesn\u2019t need to be improved on, you know? And some things sort of did reach a pinnacle in terms of, I don\u2019t know if you agree with that. Got a little sidetracked there, but\u2026\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think, like, obviously, there hasn\u2019t needed to be an improvement to the form factor of the piano, although, like, I \u2013 one of my very, very favorite stories, I tell this to engineers all the time, is you \u2013 must have seen the performances of Josef Hofmann. Like, I think there are two videos of him, like, one playing the third movement of the Emperor, funny enough, and, like, one of him playing \u2013 \n\nBEN LAUDE: Rachmaninoff prelude.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, C# Minor. And, like, it\u2019s just unbelievable to watch. And, like, one of the stories that I\u2019ve heard about \u2013 (laughter)\n\nBEN LAUDE: (Laughter/inaudible) really high. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Really high.\n\nBEN LAUDE: He knows exactly where those keys are going to be, yeah. (Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, one of the awesome things about Hoffmann is he was an inventor. Like, I think he invented the shock absorber and, you know, like, he \u2013 \n\nBEN LAUDE: And the windshield wiper.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So, he my understanding is he had a smaller hand than some of the performers like Rachmaninoff, who were, like, his contemporaries. And, like, one of the things that he did was he had a keyboard manufactured where, like, the keys were just a little bit smaller so that he could more easily, like, cover, you know, a tenth with his size hand. \n\nAnd it\u2019s, like, one of the \u2013 you know, it is just a reminder to me that, like, you don\u2019t always have to take the constraints of technology as given. Like, there\u2019s nothing holy about a piano that says that the keys have to, and, like, you know, you\u2019re shit out of luck, you know, being a performer, if you, like \u2013 you weren\u2019t born with a big enough hand. Like, you know, that\u2019s a solvable problem.\n\nBEN LAUDE: By the way, there\u2019s kind of a movement that\u2019s developing in the conservatories that I know a few pianists who are pushing for every music school to have a smaller \u2013 like, a slightly sized down instrument, the way Hoffmann ordered. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nBEN LAUDE: It\u2019s funny that Josef Hofmann was the dedicatee of Rachmaninoff\u2019s third concerto, because he never could play it, actually, despite being Rachmaninoff\u2019s favorite pianist, one of the greatest pianists of all time. His hands just weren\u2019t quite big enough. \n\nAnd speaking of Rach 3, and bringing this back to Alex Honnold, I do think that we\u2019re fascinated by the types of people, people whose brains are configured in whatever way that they have enough guts to train to climb up El Capitan with no ropes on. And although I don\u2019t want to push this metaphor too much, there is a similarity between, you know, in getting up on stage and climbing a Rachmaninoff mountain with no music, right? It\u2019s sort of similar to not having any aid. \n\nAnd it\u2019s the sense of extreme occasions, you know, those of us \u2013 my wife plays Rach 3. I play Rach 2 and Rach 4. You know, we\u2019re a Rachmaninoff family. We\u2019re totally nuts. I mean, we\u2019re people who, it\u2019s still crazy when we\u2019re walking on stage about to do one of these things. I mean, we\u2019re sort of questioning, you know, our life choices every time we\u2019re pushed on stage. (Laughter.) And yet we do it, and we\u2019re drawn back to it, and audiences are drawn to observe it. \n\nAnd I just wonder how much of that is \u2013 you know, we live lives that are just, I think, filled with so much banality \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 that we need extreme occasions, whether we\u2019re the ones engaging in them and performing them, or we\u2019re just experiencing them vicariously. We need this sense of transcending that just ordinary, everyday junk that we\u2019re \u2013 that we\u2019re used to having to wade through.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think that\u2019s true. And, like, I think, at least I do, like, I have a real appreciation for people who do hard things. Like, I \u2013 you know, we could sort of \u2013 I feel like I\u2019ve kept you too long, but, you know, like, another, like, impossible piano thing that I was thinking about recently was Maria Jo\u00e3o Pires, you know, had this famous incident a whole bunch of years ago, where she was called in to sub in for a pianist for a concert at the last minute. And she showed up thinking that she was going to play Mozart\u2019s, you know, K 488. \n\nAnd, like, what the orchestra started playing when she was at the keyboard was 466. And she\u2019s, like, sitting there at the keyboard. Like, it\u2019s on video. She\u2019s like, \u201cWhat?\u201d (Laughter.) Like, and she\u2019s, like, talking to the conductor, saying, like, you know, like, \u201c I can\u2019t.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cAh, you know, you played it last year, just.\u201d And she plays it. And, like, not only does she play it, it\u2019s like, really, really good. \n\nAnd it seems impossible. Like, how could that be? And, like, you look at it and it\u2019s, like, a miracle of a thing. And you\u2019re like, oh my God. Like, I\u2019m glad to be a human being, because, like, I can\u2019t do what she did, but, like, at least I\u2019m in the same species. (Laughter.) \n\nBEN LAUDE: I feel lucky that I\u2019ve gotten to see some of this up close. You mentioned my \u2013 this Chopin podcast, which I\u2019m \u2013 which I\u2019m launching in anticipation for the big Chopin year next year. We\u2019ve got the national competition in January. We\u2019ve got the international competition in October. So, I\u2019m going to be making lots of Chopin content. \n\nSo, I just released this video with Garrick Ohlsson where he breaks down all of Chopin\u2019s innovations at the keyboard, and shows \u2013 he actually demonstrates from, you know, 20 \u2013 actually, more than 20. It\u2019s 20 different inventions of Chopin, but dozens and dozens of examples in which, oh, Chopin was the first to cross the second finger or the fifth finger, or to have unrestricted use of the thumb on black. He has all these cool just technical innovations at the piano, and he breaks them down one by one and demonstrates them. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, that\u2019s awesome. \n\nBEN LAUDE: I went in there to his home, just thinking, okay, well, he\u2019s got all the scores by him, if we need to reference those. And I \u2013 we had not had a real meeting where I told him, you know, you need to be ready for these 42 excerpts from not just the beginnings of Chopin works, random passages from inside of them. \n\nAnd, you know, he just sort of unassumingly sat down. And I called them one out, one at a time. And just off the top of his dome, he gave it to me, not just memorized, though he remembered it, beautifully rendered passages to demonstrate each one. You know, the production flew by. He was just \u2013 you know, and it was totally off the cuff and unprepared. I mean, he\u2019d been preparing his whole life for it, and, you know, he\u2019s a special human being. And so, he has the capacity for it. And so, for him, it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s a nonchalance about it all. \n\nBut for me, and I do this kind of thing, sort of, it was still impressive. I wish people could see what I was seeing, because they\u2019re going to see the end product, which is going to be edited. But the true story is that, like, Garrick Ohlsson blew my mind for two hours. You know, there\u2019s another piece of meta content I could just make about what I witnessed. \n\nAnd I think it was similar for Maria Jo\u00e3o Pires. It was just on some level, between her ear and her experience, and how long she\u2019s lived with Mozart\u2019s music and performed these concertos, she sat there, slightly puzzled and shocked for a moment. Then she collects herself, and she\u2019s like, yeah, I know it. I\u2019ve got this. And it\u2019s amazing, so.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It is amazing. And, like \u2013 and maybe that\u2019s a great place to end. So, you know, the thing that\u2019s really interesting to me about this stuff is the layering. It\u2019s like, not just the rendered art, but it\u2019s the human being rendering it. And, like, both are compelling. And so, like, I think, you know, we just should never lose track of that. \n\nBEN LAUDE: I think it\u2019s very well said, and I would just add, it\u2019s also a historical art form. We are having conversations with history, with the way not just human beings alive today think and feel about music, but how they felt about it 100, 200, 300 years ago. And I think that\u2019s also special. And it\u2019s not something we do enough of in our world of finding opportunities and aspects of culture and art forms to take us back into history and learn something about how we got to this point. \n\nSo, that\u2019s yet another facet of classical piano that I think is so special and cool. And I wish all your friends and all my friends could love it as much as we do. So, I \u2013 suppose I\u2019ll just keep making YouTube videos until I\u2019ve achieved that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think that\u2019s what you should do.\n\nAll right, so very, very last question, like, that I ask every guest before we close. So, you\u2019ve got a super fun job that you\u2019re very passionate about. What do you do in your spare time, like, when it\u2019s not playing piano and making YouTube videos about playing piano?\n\nBEN LAUDE: Two answers to that. One, when I worked at Tonebase, you know, I was working at a startup. And so, you\u2019d think, oh, I\u2019m immersed in music all day. Sort of, but also, I was immersed in metrics and meetings and learning new applications and e-mails. So, actually, for a while, believe it or not, my hobby to get away from my tech job was practicing the piano. And I was able to keep learning repertoire. \n\nSo, that shouldn\u2019t count, because it is technically part of the profession, but I come from a sports family. It\u2019s not something anybody in my field really cares about, it seems like, but it\u2019s given me some inspiration for my videos. I mean, sports analysis, I think, and sports media and sports talk, I\u2019m borrowing from some of those techniques, and I wish there were more of a media network for classical music as there is for sports.\n\nSo, but, like, if I just need to get my mind off of the next six videos that I\u2019m somehow going to have to make this month, or the next piece I have to learn to teach, or whatever it is, I just turn on just sort of inane sports talk, people yapping about the NBA and the NFL. And so, I enjoy following that, and it just takes me back to my childhood. \n\nI \u2013 you know, I played sports a lot. I always liked sports statistics and data, and I was into those sorts of things. So, it\u2019s just kind of \u2013 I\u2019m not even \u2013 it doesn\u2019t even matter. It\u2019s just like, I put that on and it helps me get away. \n\nBut other than that, just spending time with my wife, when I can, spending time with my family. It\u2019s just, I have such an intense job, I have to shut my \u2013 I\u2019m always thinking about the next thing. I\u2019m sure you can relate to this. I\u2019m never off the clock. At Tonebase, I was always in my head, designing the next, planning the next project, designing the next video, or, you know, lesson planning for the next artist, just going on in my head until suddenly I fell asleep. \n\nAnd so, to be honest, it\u2019s something I struggle with. I need to find more ways to disconnect, but I at least have these distractions. And so, I like to rekindle some of my interests and passions from when I was younger. And, you know, at the moment, yeah, sports is one of those.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome Well, this has been an amazing conversation. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re out there doing what you\u2019re doing. So, thank you so much for taking a little bit more than an hour to chat with us today, man. \n\nBEN LAUDE: Thank you, Kevin. It was a real pleasure and an honor to be on Behind The Tech. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: What a fantastic conversation with Ben Laude. So, I\u2019m going to be honest with you, I took piano lessons as a kid, but I actually primarily took voice lessons. I don\u2019t know a lot about classical piano. I have sometimes been served by the algorithm various, you know, kind of a classical music or music interpretation, things that I\u2019ve watched and enjoyed. But a lot of what the two of you were talking about, completely over my head. But I had a great time, and it actually made me want to go back and, like, watch some of his videos and really see if I can pick up more, you know, see \u2013 get more of the intricacies of what you\u2019re talking about. \n\nI want to ask you real quick before we get into some of what you two talked about. How did you discover Ben? How did you come across him to begin with? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, I\u2019ve been, since I was a little kid, like, for whatever reason, and I still don\u2019t entirely understand it, like, I\u2019ve always found piano to be a compelling instrument. It may be, you know, all the way back to, you know, it being the, you know, my \u2013 my favorite part of going to church on Sunday was, you know, we had this, you know, little old lady who was, like, dear and sweet, who, you know, had taught herself how to play piano at a pretty high level. \n\nAnd, like, that was the part of that Sunday that I always enjoyed the most. And, like, I would try to go sit in the church as close as possible so that I could see her hands when she played, because I was just fascinated by the whole thing. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, like, I\u2019ve just been hooked ever since, you know. And it was hard to be hooked on classical piano in rural Central Virginia in the \u201870s and \u201880s, because this was not what the cool kids did. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And, like, there was nobody else who, you know, around me, who was obsessed by this stuff, nobody to talk to and no Internet to go explore. \n\nAnd you know, I\u2019ve been on YouTube. Like, one of the amazing things about YouTube is, from pretty early on in the platform, people started posting piano performance there.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes, yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And, like, the volume\u2019s just been higher and higher and higher. And then, you know, so, like, I\u2019m constantly on the lookout for new and interesting classical piano content on the Internet. And then, you know, I\u2019ve been watching Ben\u2019s content for a whole bunch of years now, ever since, like, Tonebase first got started, because, like, honestly, I think he said it in the interview, like, he borrows a whole bunch of techniques from sports reporters, like, people who are, like, commenting on sports performance. And it really does make his content accessible. \n\nSo, like, he\u2019s talking about, you know, piano performance instead of, you know, sports performance, but \u2013 \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: You know it\u2019s a similar sort of approach. And, like, it\u2019s really, really, like, fun to watch his content, I think.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, no, totally. I\u2019ve seen some of his videos and I also, I\u2019ve been served, like, I said, from the algorithm, weirdly, a bunch of drum videos where people do similar things, where they analyze drum performances and drum solos, mostly in that case, not in classical works, but in popular music.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: If you like drum videos, like, the thing, like, somehow or another algorithm put this in my feed the other week, there\u2019s this platform called Drumeo that\u2019s \u2013 \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes, that\u2019s \u2013 okay, that\u2019s what I saw, and, like, the musicians who play the things without ever hearing it, without ever hearing the drum part.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And so, like, the best thing on their platform is the drummer from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, like, playing this \u201c30 Seconds to Mars\u201d song \u2013 \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes, yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 where he gets to hear the song with no drum in the track.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Exactly. It\u2019s so good!\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: He listens to, like, a few bars of it, and then he just nails it. Like, it\u2019s unbelievable. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Nails it. (Laughter.) No, it is. It is, and actually, it\u2019s funny, because I was thinking about that a little bit while the two of you, while you and Ben, were talking about the different interpretations of work, right, and which is so interesting, right, because it is interesting. You can have \u2013 you know, in this case, it\u2019s someone who doesn\u2019t even have the notations to go on, right? They don\u2019t even have the notes. They literally are hearing all the other parts and are having to kind of fill in the drum parts. \n\nBut it is in some ways, very similar to classical music, where, you know, you have the work as it\u2019s written, but it can be interpreted different ways. And even, you know, his example, you know, in one case, he was trying to replicate another, you know, pianist\u2019s approached a piece of work, but that was only one aspect of that piece of work, that it turns out, you know, that was only, you know, one instance where it was played. It became very famous, but it wasn\u2019t even the way that he did it all the time. And that, to me, is such an interesting and I think, unique part of music. \n\nAnd in some ways, I feel like there are direct juxtapositions that you can draw to tech, because you can create a function and you can create a program that can solve the same thing multiple ways. But in some ways it kind of goes against some of our you know, thinking in ones and zeros way, because, you know, you want things to always build and run a certain way. \n\nAnd so, I was curious, kind of from your perspective of someone who is deeply into piano and is also deeply into, you know, tech, where do you see kind of some of, I guess, maybe the similarity points in how, you know, art and code kind of intersect?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I\u2019ve always thought that there was this thing going on with code that is more than just a mechanical thing. Like, one of the reasons that I\u2019ve loved being a programmer for so many years is, like, I have these ideas in my head and things that I want to do that are difficult to articulate or difficult to accomplish any other way than writing code. \n\nAnd in a certain sense, it, like, feels more like a mode of expression than it feels like this sort of mechanical thing where it\u2019s like, all right, like, I\u2019ve got to crank this code out and, you know, get it done on time. And, like, you know, punch the clock and done, right?\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And there\u2019s some amount of grinding like that, that you have to do to accomplish, like, you know, sort of interesting things at scale in teams of other people. But, like, you know, the very best moments that I\u2019ve had as a programmer, like, I feel like I\u2019m expressing something. And, like, it feels like you\u2019re making a little piece of art. And, you know, the esthetic quality, aspect of what you\u2019re doing is maybe just as important or more important than the, you know, the mechanical aspect of it. \n\nAnd so, I think that\u2019s pretty similar to, you know, like, what you\u2019re doing with piano performance. Like, it is completely and utterly uninteresting to listen to a piano performance where, you know, the pianist is just sort of robotically playing exactly the notes that are on the score as notated by the composer.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, the thing that audiences, I think, are looking for is, like, you know, what do you as the performer bring to this score that is interesting or different? Like, how do you help us hear something that we\u2019ve never heard before? Like, what is it about you, like, in the moment of the performance that is interesting, that we can connect with? And so, like, I think that\u2019s, you know, just sort of it\u2019s, like, the interesting thing. \n\nAnd, like, you know, Ben and I chatted about this. You know, like, there is this aspect of piano performance and computer programming that\u2019s kind of the same. Like, you\u2019ve got this machine. It\u2019s unruly, it\u2019s complicated. Like, it takes a long time to master.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: You know, like, the process of mastering, it requires that, you know, like, mostly, it\u2019s like you and the machine wrestling. And you know, it\u2019s like, you know \u2013 it can be a solitary activity. \n\nBut, you know, I think the \u2013 you know, the interesting thing about both of those media is not that mechanical thing. It\u2019s not the fact that, like, hey, like, I\u2019m a good programmer now, and, like, I can write, like, this huge range of programs, or, like, hey, I have the dexterity and, like, all the theory in my head. And, like, I can play, like, any score that you stick in front of my nose. It\u2019s like the interesting thing is, what you choose to do with that capability, and, you know, and who you\u2019re doing it for. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes, yes. No, I think well said. And yeah, I think that that\u2019s true for both disciplines and how it\u2019s also one of those things that\u2019s true with code and with art. How you create something and how it\u2019s interpreted, what your intent and how things are interpreted can be different. You know, what your intent is when you put code out in the world, and how people use it are different.\n\nSame with music, right, like how someone, you know, writes a score, or even, you know, releases a produced piece of work, and how it\u2019s interpreted and how it makes people feel are not the same. Sometimes they can be, but that they\u2019re not always. And that, I think, is pretty magical, regardless what we\u2019re talking about.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And, like, I\u2019ve been having this argument with a bunch of people for, like, the best bunch of months. Like, there\u2019s some people who, you know, like some of these, like, their videos online, like Reid Hoffman and I did a conversation with JJ Abrams about, you know, AI and filmmaking, you know. And JJ\u2019s a super good friend, but, you know, I\u2019ve got a slightly different point of view about where things are likely headed. \n\nAnd, like \u2013 and my point of view is art is not about the instrument. And, like, AI is the instrument here. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Art is about, like, what humans choose to do with the instruments. And, you know, I think, you know, we\u2019ve seen it in every other flavor of, you know, technological instrument that we\u2019ve ever built. Like, the interesting thing about it is how it gets wielded, like not \u2013 you know, like, it\u2019s not a thing in and of itself that\u2019s particularly compelling, unless you\u2019re a technician.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right. Yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, there are things about pianos, right? Like, you know, there\u2019s this new \u2013 new-ish piano company, Fazioli, right? Like, you would sort of think that, you know, pianos don\u2019t need, you know, refinement and no new piano companies need to get creative. But, you know, there\u2019s this Italian piano company that got created over the past handful of decades that\u2019s making what many people believe are the world\u2019s best pianos. And so, you know, if you\u2019re the founder of Fazioli, you\u2019re very interested in the instrument, right? \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But even then, the instrument is only worth making if you can find artists who want to play it \u2013 \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Exactly.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 to go make something interesting with.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Exactly, if they can do things. Cameras are the same way, right? Like, we\u2019ve had so many camera advancements that can be used by maybe a greater cross section of people than pianos. However, it\u2019s the exact same thing. You know, the lens technology and the sensor technologies and what\u2019s being done is only useful if the people who are really technicians and are really skilled with what they can do with it. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I \u2013 I think that\u2019s a very, very good example, because, like, a camera is absolutely ubiquitous right now. All of us have a better camera in our pockets than our parents ever had in their entire lifetime. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, they\u2019re extraordinarily good cameras. That does not mean that you can take a good photo. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, it doesn\u2019t. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: A good photo is you see something that you want to encapsulate in a photograph that actually has a point of view, and that when you show it to someone else, like, it helps them see a thing that they can\u2019t see with their own two eyes. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Absolutely, absolutely. Some of the best photographs I\u2019ve ever taken were with a Holga camera that when I was in college, it was a toy camera that I retrofitted to a Polaroid. And you know, it\u2019s not great resolution and some of the other things aren\u2019t good. But just the shots I was able to get and some of the things that I got with it are some of my favorites, whether other people think that or not. It has nothing to do with the tool itself. Like, you said, it\u2019s what the person is seeing, what they\u2019re able to create with it. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know what your thought is on this. I think we might align, but, like, the way I look at AI is that we need to be cautious about how these things can be overused and maybe used in some ways that we don\u2019t want, but I firmly believe that the best musicians are going to use these as just another tool, the same way they\u2019ve been using technology for decades. And that it\u2019s not going to take someone who\u2019s not a musician and make them one, but it will be something that will take artists and maybe enhance or augment what they do. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think you and I are aligned. I think in the hands of someone who\u2019s got a vision and a point of view and creativity, that it will let them do extraordinary things. And I think if you don\u2019t have those things, like, if you are not \u2013 if you\u2019re not very deliberate about, like, how can I use the tool to, like, the extent of its ability to make something extraordinary, like, you\u2019re not going to get anything extraordinary out of it.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Definitely, definitely. And I\u2019m grateful that we have people like Ben, who are teaching people the fundamentals and are talking about and interpreting and dissecting and doing the play by play, so that even people like me can, you know, have more respect and grasp more about the works we hear. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it was a fun conversation. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Absolutely. All right, that is all the time that we have for today. Thank you so much to Ben Laude for joining us.
