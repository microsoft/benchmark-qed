Welcome to Behind the Tech.  I'm your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we're going to get behind the tech.  We'll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did.  So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what's happening today.  Stick around.  \n\n[MUSIC] \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Hello, and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Christina Warren, senior cloud advocate at Microsoft. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And I\u2019m Kevin Scott. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Our guest on the show today is Chase Jarvis. Chase is an award-winning artist. He\u2019s the founder of Creative Live and author of the new national bestseller, \u201cCreative Calling.\u201d\n\nNow, I know that a lot of our listeners tune into the show to hear about all things tech, but we believe that creativity is at the heart of every great tech innovation, and that parallels exist in the creative process, whether you\u2019re a software developer, business leader, or an artist, like Chase. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. I think Chase has a really good take on this that hopefully we\u2019ll get a chance to chat about here in a minute. But I am a very, very strong believer that all forms of creativity are similar in many, many ways. I spend a lot of my own time doing creative things like making furniture or, you know, learning how to use my machines in my machine shop.  \n\nAnd, like, I\u2019m really convinced that it helps make me better at making technical decisions, writing code, and like, I\u2019ve always believed that coding is a creative undertaking. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Yeah, no, I totally agree. I think creativity and coding go hand in hand. But let\u2019s go ahead and get into our conversation with Chase. \n\n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Our guest today is Chase Jarvis. Chase is an award-winning artist, author, entrepreneur, and photographer. His expansive work ranges from shooting advertising campaigns for companies like Nike and Red Bull, to collaborating with icons like Lady Gaga. \n\nHe\u2019s the founder and CEO of Creative Live, where more than 10 million students learn photography, video, design, music, and business from the world\u2019s top creators and entrepreneurs. His new book, \u201cCreative Calling,\u201d launched this spring \u2013 debuted an instant national bestseller. Welcome to the show, Chase. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  Thank you Kevin, I appreciate it. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, so, I really, really want to get into Creative Live and your book. And, like, I am a customer of Creative Live, actually. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  Love to hear that. Love to hear it. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  But, so, first, maybe we can start with your background, like, were you always a creative person? Like, what was your childhood like? \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  Well, that\u2019s a great place to start off. First, I do want to say thank you so much for behind the technology, you as a technologist for embracing that creative side. So many people, and this goes back to \u2013 it relates to your question about my history. So many people understand creativity as art. While art is a great example of creativity, I always want to talk about creativity with a capital C. That includes, you know, creativity underpins the solution to every problem we will ever know. \n\nWriting code is incredibly creative, as is this conversation we\u2019re having here. We\u2019re co-creating this conversation right now and either one of us could take this in an exciting different direction. To me, that\u2019s part of what makes creativity so sort of, A, misunderstood, but B, vital. It\u2019s like, you know, great lives, great products, great experiences. You know, they\u2019re not found. I\u2019m what they call a \u201cfounder.\u201d I didn\u2019t find anything, I built Creative Live from the ground up with hundreds of other committed people. \n\nSo, I think I want to first establish that, you know, creativity with a capital C is what we\u2019re all talking about here. \n\nAs it relates to my childhood, I think I did have a very creative childhood. In part, I was an only child, and my parents would say things like, \u201cOkay, here\u2019s a block of wood, you know, go play in the back yard by yourself for a few hours and entertain yourself and cultivate curiosity and storytelling\u201d and all the things that we know kids do so well. \n\nAnd, you know, part of my ethos and why I wrote \u201cCreative Calling\u201d and founded Creative Live was to help people understand that that creativity that we\u2019re able to connect with as young people is actually the same vital driving force as adults. Yet, we have found ways to, in large part, write it out of our day to day because we were coached by either a career counselor, teacher or a parent or a spouse that for some reason it wasn\u2019t practical. \n\nMy fundamental principle is that it\u2019s actually the most practical thing there is on the planet and we do it all every day. And if we just acknowledge it as such, we could drive it to our advantage in a way that few people actually get to do. So, let\u2019s create a more accessible, creative world. My childhood was very much that. My parents, I was raised very middle, lower middle class. My dad was a cop, my mom was a secretary at a biotech company. \n\nAnd that didn\u2019t stop me from trying to express who I was, until I started, you know, bumping into all those teachers and the school system and so many of the things that, sometimes for good reason, you know, provide constraints.\n\nI believe that it\u2019s our job as adults to unlearn a lot of those constraints that school and career counselors and parents and often people who meant really well for us, you know, that they placed on us so that we can reach our true potential. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  I so agree with that sentiment and push. Like, one of the things I\u2019d love to get your opinion on is it, oftentimes, people look at the end product of creativity. So, like, a work of art, a photograph, a recording, like, a software system, a business, a book \u2013 whatever it might be. \n\nAnd the creative process that helped create that thing isn\u2019t visible. And, like, we think it\u2019s mysterious and hard and inaccessible and it\u2019s one of the things that I love about Creative Live. So, I\u2019m an amateur photographer and I\u2019ve taken a whole bunch of classes on Creative Live to try to get my photographic technique better. And, like, I didn\u2019t feel like I was being intimidated by the process of, like, looking at a great photographer and saying, \u201cOh, like, I don\u2019t understand this. I can\u2019t do this.\u201d Like, I was just sort of curious, like, how on God\u2019s earth do these folks do what they\u2019re doing? Like, I want to know. I want to understand and, like, Creative Live and, like, so many resources that we have available to us now help with that. \n\nSo, like, how, like, how do you think about that, like, this sort of, like, the process of creativity? \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  Well, I love that you asked the process question, because I think at its foundation, that\u2019s one of the reasons that it\u2019s wildly misunderstood. And I think this is a good place for me to interject. I basically end my book, \u201cCreative Calling,\u201d and as sort of the principles that underpin my life, there are three core principles. The first one is that every person is creative by nature \u2013 limitless possibility. Again, just the example that you and I are co-creating this conversation right now that you create every morning, you wake up, you decide. There\u2019s this idea of autonomy and opportunity that we all decide what we\u2019re going to do with our time. \n\nPrinciple two, which relates to your question directly, that creativity is a habit, not a skill. It\u2019s a process. It\u2019s a practice. \n\nIt\u2019s just like a muscle that we develop. And if I were to ask you, how would you \u2013 you know, if you want to develop bigger biceps, what would you do? You would work those biceps out. So, creativity is the same thing. It\u2019s this act of repeating creating or repeating a biceps curl that\u2019s going to make you stronger. Now, there are skills that can help you create prettier things, but creativity, itself, is a habit. It\u2019s a process. \n\nNow, the third thing which I think is the \u2013 this is where hopefully the \u2013 your brain is going to wake up now if you\u2019re a listener right now, the process that we go through in creating anything, whether it\u2019s a photo, a computer program, a business, many of the examples that you gave, the process that we go through in creating anything, the muscles that we use, those are the exact same muscles that we use to create our lives. \n\nCreating a life is just creativity at a bigger scale. And so for the listener who\u2019s sitting there right now and there\u2019s a distance between where you are and where you want to be in your life, if you just look at it as a creative process, as a process where you\u2019re putting one foot in front of another over and over, hopefully you know, you might be 10,000 hours away from mastering your life, but you\u2019re only one decision, and that is the decision to try \u2013 to begin the process of creating with intention the life that you want. \n\nSo, it\u2019s crazy that you\u2019re going to go home tonight and you\u2019re going to decide what to cook for dinner, that\u2019s a creative process. And the same things that are at play there, what am I going to do? What ingredients am I going to put in? How long am I going to take to do it? Where am I going to do it? All of those things are the same ingredients that we have in creating our life. So, again, everyone\u2019s creative. Two, creativity is a habit. And three, the process that we go through in creating anything is how we actually create our lives.  \n\nTo me, that \u2013 just the triumvirate of those things is \u2013 it ought to embolden everyone listening with this opportunity that, you know, we don\u2019t stumble into this world. You\u2019re not a quirk in the tide, that by \u2013 with a little bit of intention, just like you could create a meal for your family, that you can create this life that you might feel distanced from right now that is inspiring, enriching, and this is one precious thing that we get. So, let\u2019s make it a masterpiece. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, so true, like, not just beautiful sentiment, like, I actually believe the truth of what you\u2019re saying.  I do want to focus a little bit on this idea of creativity as habit because, like, that really, really strongly resonates with me. \n\nSo, as we\u2019re having this conversation right now, I\u2019m about to take some time over the next couple of weeks to just spend two weeks of my time learning. What I intend to learn are adding a set of things to my creative arsenal. It\u2019s almost like working out the creative muscle. So, I\u2019ve got someone who\u2019s going to come to my shop and teach me how to use my TIG welder better. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  There you go, amazing. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  I tell people I\u2019m doing this and they\u2019re, like, \u201cWhat does TIG welding have to do with being CTO of Microsoft?\u201d And I really do believe this thing that you said, that, you know, adding that skill to my arsenal and then using it, like, I have a project. Like, I\u2019m not just going to learn the skill in a vacuum, I\u2019ve already designed this steel and walnut bench that I\u2019m going to make. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  Amazing. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And so, it\u2019s going to be so much fun. And I\u2019m going to then have this creative experience that\u2019s going to not just be fun, but I think it\u2019s going to help me be more creative in general. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  This is \u2013 let\u2019s use science for a second. The science on creativity is really clear, that creating anything helps you create everything. And so, truthfully, like, you learning to weld and expressing what it\u2019s like to try and put two or more things in your world that previously weren\u2019t put together to try and put those ideas together in real time, your brain is literally, you know, it\u2019s \u2013 neuroplasticity is not new probably to your audience. That means your brain has the capability of learning new things and creating new pathways and connecting things that used to not be connected. Like, that is the act of creating at its most fundamental level. \n\nAnd that is a transferrable skill. That experience of creating, you know, the walnut and steel piece \u2013 was it steel? Is that right? Walnut and steel? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yes. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  That, like, the act of conceiving, of planning, of activating those neural pathways, that\u2019s the same set of muscles that is going to help you solve the problem in the boardroom that\u2019s going to help you unlock the next chapter of technology for Microsoft. And, you know, this idea that somehow we as humans are divorced from this process, that we either have it or not. \n\nYou know, the really sad thing, I\u2019ll tell you a short story about my childhood. So, you asked, did I \u2013 believe I was creative, I did until second grade. And I walked in my second-grade classroom. It was the student-teacher conference night, and they paired it with the ice cream social. So, you could show up after school, you know, your parent or guardian would have 10 minutes with the teacher while the kids are supervised eating ice cream in the gymnasium or whatever. \n\nAnd I happened to go looking for my mom in my second-grade classroom, Miss Kelly, and I happened to walk in. There were some other student \u2013 there were some other folks waiting in line. And I walked in there just in time to hear my teacher, Miss Kelly, tell my mom that I was so much better at sports than I was at art. \n\nNow, I had just come off of my \u2013 I made my first film in the summer between first and second grade, I had a magic show, I had a stand-up comedy act. I thought of myself as artistic. And to hear that from my teacher was just \u2013 it was, like, \u201cHmm.\u201d And you know, maybe some empathetic listeners out there and saying, \u201cOh, poor young Chase.\u201d But what poor young Chase did was just adapt. I did whatever my second-grade teacher said. \u201cHmm, I\u2019m good at sports, that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to get revered and respected and patted on the back as a good little boy.\u201d \n\n\nAnd so, I ran headlong into sports. Sure enough, it served me well. I went on to be successful in sports, I went to college on a soccer scholarship, played on an Olympic development team, but I turned my back on creativity because my second-grade teacher said I wasn\u2019t good at it. How sort of sad. And it was only through a \u2013 if you read the book, I chronicle the story pretty carefully about my grandfather actually died and I was given his cameras. And this was a catalyst for me to sort of dig back into it. \n\nBut, you know, if you look at your initial question or comment about the relationship between trying new things and how it could possibly affect your ability to be a better CTO, like, the science is really clear. It\u2019s messy, because right now there\u2019s someone who\u2019s listening to this who subscribes to your show because they think of themselves as a technologist and thinks that creativity is sort of a nice to have.  \n\nBut if you look around and just to be direct, I have deconstructed the lives of hundreds and hundreds of the most creative, successful people in the world that have been on my podcast, that reach on Creative Live, that are now my friends. These are billionaires, entrepreneurs, genius creators, you know, everything in between. And there is a correlation \u2013 they all understand that the opportunity to learn new skills, to put yourself around people who, you know, build you up rather than knock you down, this idea that spending time pursuing things that interest you for which you have curiosity, that these are force multipliers to everything in your life. \n\nAnd, ultimately, sort of a concept that I\u2019ve taken away from these hundreds of conversations are that choosing creativity in your life is, ultimately, refusing to betray your potential. \n\nChoosing creativity is refusing to betray your potential. And it seems like with your project, deciding that you\u2019re actively going to invest in learning and experimentation and building that \u2013 your creative biceps by actually learning to weld and doing hobbies that seem irreverent relative to your professional life, that\u2019s actually where the best stuff in life really is. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, I \u2013 yeah, (laughter) strongly, strongly agree with that. And, you know, it\u2019s sort of interesting, like, when your teacher told you \u2013 or was telling your mom that you were so much better at sports than art, like, I think this is another thing people get confused about all the time. So, she may have had in her head that like you weren\u2019t good at some, like, like, technical skill in art. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  Painting, right. Shading. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And so, like \u2013 \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  I\u2019m eight. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  \u2013 that has nothing to do whether or not you\u2019re creative. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  For sure. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  So, like, you could learn skills, you can accumulate them, like, this loop that you were describing where, you know, curiosity and investing in yourself, you know, is sort of at the core of creativity, like, you can learn anything. Like, I\u2019m really convinced of this. Especially with kids, like, I hate this idea that you are \u2013 that, like, we tell children that they\u2019re not good at something. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  For sure. I mean, let\u2019s walk into any second-grade classroom, since I used grade two as my example and Miss Kelly shut me down. Walk into any first-, second-grade classroom, go up to the front of the room and say, \u201cWho wants to come up to the front and draw me a picture?\u201d How many hands go up? Every hand. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Every hand? \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  Every hand goes up. And then you ask the same question as a sixth grader and then a ninth grader and then a senior. \n\nAnd the number of hands that go up sort of systematically goes down. Now, I feel like we are on the cusp of a complete transformation and a reawakening, largely in part \u2013 you know, the work that you do to put tools in the hands of people and to remove the gates from, you know, popular culture. You used to have to know a bunch of gallerists to hang your art in a public space or you used to have to get the permission of a photo editor, a magazine editor to write. Now, because of the internet, you know, we\u2019re largely on the \u2013 on the early part of the back side of the democratization of all of these tools where they\u2019re free, cheap, or widely accessible. \n\nAnd look what\u2019s happening? The creator economy \u2013 I mean, 40% of Americans have a side hustle where they may money beyond their actual 9:00-5:00. That\u2019s 70 million working Americans have a side hustle. And that\u2019s one of the fastest-growing parts of the economy. I think it\u2019s the fastest. \n\nSo, this idea that for somehow not entrepreneurial, not creative, when you look at the economic creative class, to use Richard Florida\u2019s term, it\u2019s a transformational size of the economy. And then if you look one level below that, what\u2019s beneath that \u2013 the human beings that are actually doing that work. That\u2019s you, that\u2019s me, and that\u2019s that would-be doubter who\u2019s saying, \u201cHmm, I don\u2019t think of myself as creative because, you know, it wasn\u2019t sort of fostered in me.\u201d What if we could turn that frown upside down? What if we could change that belief that that person who does not see themselves as creative? \n\nI just think the power there is acknowledging our own creativity is the human superpower, it\u2019s part of what differentiates us from every other species on the planet. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  So, let\u2019s maybe talk a little bit about the process of being creative. Like, one of the things I think people get hung up on is fear of critique or fear of failing. Like, I remember I went to a Ralph Gibson workshop on photography. Ralph is, like, one of the \u2013 one of the, you know, most famous photographers of the, you know, sort of mid late 20th century. \n\nAnd you know, I have no business on paper being at this workshop with him. Like, I didn\u2019t go to art school, I\u2019m not a professional photographer, like, my photographs haven\u2019t been in any galleries, like, there\u2019s nothing by any sort of traditional measures that would say that my, like, my photographic skill or my work would merit, you know, like me being able to, you know, sit down and learn with someone like Ralph Gibson with a group of other, you know, aspirant photographers. \n\nYou know, and so like that\u2019s one weird thing, like, the \u201cI am not worthy\u201d you know mindset that sometimes people have. And then the other is, like, I was a little bit anxious about going to this thing because, like, you know, what is this person who is like a really eminent photographer going to think of my work? And is he going to think it\u2019s all garbage and, you know, am I going to be embarrassed. \n\nAnd, you know, like, the thing that I\u2019ve just sort of learned is my process of becoming a computer scientist and, like, a tech person over the years is, like, that I\u2019ve had to get over this imposter syndrome that I always have and, like, and be willing to make myself vulnerable to situations where I\u2019m pushing myself beyond my limits. \n\nAnd whenever I do that, like, I learn something and I\u2019m able to do more afterwards using what I\u2019ve learned. And so, I don\u2019t know whether you see that pattern with other folks. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  Oh, what you just described is \u2013 it\u2019s beautiful when you actually are able to transcend that fear even for a moment, because you do it once and you\u2019re, like, wait, all the best stuff in life is on the other side of fear. And whether that\u2019s fear of being judged, fear of not being enough, fear of someone laughing at your creation or your first stab at something, on the other side of all of that is where the best stuff is. \n\nAnd, again, I go back to this concept of just imagine if you could set aside your ego even temporarily in order to try something new, to try that thing that lights you up. \n\nLike, that is, to me, the human superpower, when you enmesh some passion, a little curiosity, a little opportunity and the temporary suspension of fear to do something that you are enthusiastic about, that\u2019s, you know, if you don\u2019t love your job or you\u2019re tired all the time, what you\u2019re really tired of doing is things that don\u2019t inspire you. And as soon as you can direct your attention and your experience \u2013 and to be clear, again, you are in charge. You might have bills; you might have all of the things that are typical trappings and excuses that I hear people make that are all very real. There\u2019s privilege involved. There\u2019s opportunity costs. There\u2019s opportunity period with a capital O \u2013 all those things are hurdles. \n\nBut if you take even for a small moment and even once a week and then once a day and then once an hour you start learning into overcoming or transcending or just borrowing \u2013 pretending for long enough that those fears and trappings don\u2019t exist, that is the ticket to being able to live the dream that how you spend your time, what you work on, who you work with \u2013 it\u2019s actually, again, it might be 10,000 hours away if you actually to get to do those things professionally or for a living or even if you just want them to be an enriching hobby, but you\u2019re only one decision away from deciding to try. \n\nAnd, to me, that is exciting. When I hear you say you\u2019re going to go to this class with Ralph, the \u2013 you know, the book that you mentioned early in the intro and that I wrote is essentially it is a Trojan horse. You know, it\u2019s a book about creativity.  \n\nYes, it will help you supercharge all your creative endeavors, whether you want to, again, make a workbench, a computer program, a business, or a meal or whatever. But the Trojan horse is that this is sort of this key to unlocking your human potential. And it\u2019s intimidating, like, where do I even start? So, I\u2019ve tried to make it brutally simple. The book is divided into four parts and the acronym is very simple. It\u2019s a creative process, and you can apply this to anything. You can apply it to dinner; you can apply it to your life. \n\nI-D-E-A, idea. I stands for \u201cimagine:\u201d D, for \u201cdesign;\u201d E, \u201cexecute;\u201d and then A, \u201camplify.\u201d This is just a very simple four-step process for anything creative. And I\u2019ll just walk you through one example. \n\nImagine is we have lost our ability to imagine what\u2019s possible. We\u2019re told by our career counselor. We\u2019re told by our parents. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re going to do one of these four jobs. You\u2019re going to be a doctor, a lawyer, a \u2013 you know, whatever makes your parents proud.\u201d That\u2019s not imagining what\u2019s possible for this one precious life. \n\nYou know, and to be fair, it\u2019s confusing because this comes as information, comes from people who we care about and who care about us very much. And so, you know, to go against these \u2013 the messages that we get from popular culture to be rich and fit and all these things, look, we\u2019ve lost our ability to imagine what we want for us. \n\nSo, how do you start \u2013 how do you rekindle that? You just start to play in your mind, imagine what \u2013 if you could write a script, what would it look like? So, imagine. \n\nThe second step, and this is true, again, with dinner or your life. Imagine what you want to eat. Design a plan to get what you want to eat. That\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ve got to go to the grocery store, I\u2019ve got to spend $18 on, you know, I\u2019ve got to get some chicken, I\u2019ve got to get some pasta \u2013 whatever the thing is. \n\nSo, you\u2019re designing a plan to get there. If I go to the store and I allow enough time, I\u2019m going to be able to cook a different, new, exciting meal and I found a recipe, whatever. \n\nImagine, design the plan. Execute the thing. Right? Do the thing. Do the process. Make the bench, go to the photography seminar, make a new picture. And then the thing that is missing from 99% of the people\u2019s equation out there is this idea that I call \u201camplify.\u201d It\u2019s the \u201cA\u201d in the IDEA framework. That is show other people. Talk about it. Because in doing so, in verbalizing it and saying, \u201cHey, I made a new meal, it\u2019s a little bit of an experiment. Join me at the table, tell me if it\u2019s too spicey or you don\u2019t like olives.\u201d Like, in engaging, that is inherently human. And you get feedback on your process. You get to develop an awareness of are you hurt by that feedback? Are you inspired by that feedback? Does it make you want to do more or less? \n\nBut most importantly, when you put it out there in the world, it\u2019s acknowledgement that you are creative. So, if this little people that are, say, technologists that listen to your podcast are victims to what I shared earlier, that cultural sort of narrowing of creativity with a capital C, if you just apply that four-step process to anything, I think it\u2019s a good step in getting you where to go \u2013 where you want to go. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. And, like, I really do think that last bit around amplifying, like, showing your work, like, it\u2019s also helps create connection. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  For sure. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Like, so many of the best conversations that I have ever had come from meeting people I otherwise wouldn\u2019t have met because I showed them something that I\u2019ve made. They\u2019re, like, \u201cOh.\u201d \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  There\u2019s vulnerability in there, there\u2019s an authenticity. And for people that are scared or don\u2019t have skills, great, how do you get any skill? You practice. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yes. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  And whether you\u2019re practicing singing or guitar or, again, there\u2019s any number of things that we\u2019ve named, like, that\u2019s actually a bonding experience when you sit down with other people who have shared interests. And you don\u2019t have to actually sit down, you know, whether we\u2019re still emerging from the pandemic here or whether you live in, you know, Muskogee, Illinois or in the middle of what you don\u2019t consider to be a creative hotbed, you can actually connect with people, use Creative Live as an example. There\u2019s a community of 10 million people there who are creating and learning. And if you start to do that together, that is an empowering feeling. \n\nAs you\u2019ve shared just moments ago, like, that vulnerability in sharing and connecting around these ideas that you have about, you know, what you can do, make, be, or become, like, that \u2013 we\u2019re social animals. Whether you\u2019re an introvert or an extrovert, this is, you know, this is something that will light you up. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, and honestly, I think \u2013 so, I\u2019m an introvert, like, super-duper, capital I introvert. And I think maybe for introverts, like, it\u2019s one of the more valuable things that you can do because it\u2019s like a super structured way for you to connect with other people. It\u2019s like, you know, it\u2019s a built-in ice breaker. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  Yep. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Like, here\u2019s this thing, I made a bench, I made a mechanical doohickey, I wrote a piece of software that I\u2019m making open source. I, you know, I\u2019ve done this thing and like I\u2019m just going to put it out there into the world. And then the conversation can be around that thing. And so, like, you just know what you\u2019re walking into. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  Yeah, and it is. It\u2019s an invitation to connect with just a little bit of distance when necessary. I\u2019m married to an extreme introvert and I am relatively extroverted, myself. And so, observing, you know, I approached that \u2013 like, her introvertedness as a little bit of a learning for how the different sort of introvert or extrovert or ambivert might look at the creative process or might look at feedback. \n\nAnd what I learned, you know, we\u2019ve been married for more than 20 years now, so this is that it truly is accessible to everyone and creativity is this invitation to connect around shared ideas, shared experiences. And now, with the internet being, you know, connecting us and providing a vehicle, a set of pipes for connection, like, that is \u2013 that serves any personality type. It serves the opportunity for you to have mentors that are \u2013 would historically have been way out of your league. \n\nYou know, you talked about getting together with Ralph, well, if you couldn\u2019t sign up on the internet, you know, you probably wouldn\u2019t have been there. You know, that\u2019s why Creative Live was so disruptive, because people used to spend $3,000-$5,000, fly across the country to New York, stay in a hotel for three days to try and learn with some master. \n\nNow, you can not just take a class with them, you can correspond with them in real time and ask them questions. And to me, that\u2019s just \u2013 that\u2019s glorious. And for those who are listening to this right now and this idea is new to you, this is what you\u2019re missing. And for those who are practiced, this is your ticket to pursuing, you know, your dreams for this one precious life. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. It\u2019s \u2013 I think Creative Live is a really amazing community. One of \u2013 the first class that I took on Creative Live was from a photographer named Joey L. Joey is this very, super-talented, young documentary portrait photographer. So, like, you know, I think he\u2019s shot advertising and, like, a bunch of, you know, a bunch of commercial work, but he uses that as a way to fund these explorations that he does. Like, he\u2019ll go to Africa, he will go to India, like, he goes into these communities and he tries to capture something about these communities that are reflective\u2013 \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  He\u2019s very cause driven. Right. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  He uses the money that he makes from commercial to make other great art that unlocks, you know, our awareness about indigenous people and conflict. You know, I think that\u2019s a great way for people who are introverted or are, you know, are looking for an example of where to get started. Like, how can you learn from someone like Joey L.? How can you start to apply your skills and experience and whatever you\u2019ve done for your life? You have a gift. Whatever is in your childhood, that thing that lit you up when you were eight or 10 or 15 or 20, whether it was guitar or a computer. \n\nLike, you \u2013 those are available to you right now, today. You can stop listening to this podcast, you can drive to a store, you can look something up online, you could join a free class, you could \u2013 you know, there\u2019s so many ways to activate. I just think that that\u2019s so refreshing, so empowering. And this idea that we\u2019re a quirk in the tide, we can sort of shelve that \u2013 what I think is antiquated, understandably, because so many people feel like that. That\u2019s, you know, that\u2019s what a school system and a work system is, you know, designed to do. \n\nThere\u2019s no malevolent dictator making us feel that, but that\u2019s, you know, a mass culture and society is \u2013 that\u2019s part of how it manages people, right? You have to put them in a system, otherwise it\u2019s too much for the system to handle. And yet, you don\u2019t have to succumb to that. \n\nAnd it takes a little bit of awakening \u2013 just a tad bit of awareness, and then the application of this process \u2013 this creative process \u2013 imagine, design, execute, and amplify, toward anything, and I promise, if you do this, you know, one or two or three times, the first time it\u2019s a little painful, I\u2019m not going to lie. It\u2019s sort of like Bikram yoga or I think it\u2019s just hot yoga now because the guy Bikram is a real jerk, so they took his namesake away from him. But hot yoga, like, the first time you do it, it kicks your butt. And if you \u2013 if you\u2019re willing to sign up for five sessions, the second time you\u2019re like, it sucked a little bit less, but I can see the benefits. The third time, like, wow, I\u2019ve never felt better. Fourth and fifth, you\u2019re excited. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  And the same is true with going to the gym or creating. The first time you sit down to try and write a song after you haven\u2019t written one since you were 14, painful. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, and it\u2019s certainly true for code, like, coding is this thing where it takes everyone a while to get good at it.  \n\nAnd, like, this is the thing, you know, I tell people all the time, you shouldn\u2019t let the fact that your first attempts are painful or not quite as successful or as easy as you would like them to be to deter you from continuing to try. I mean, it\u2019s like \u2013 like a virtuoso concert pianist, like, I think sometimes we have this romantic idea that these virtuosi are just sort of born with, you know, the ability to, you know, play, you know, a Liszt piano concert or Chopin ballad, you know, it \u2013 and it\u2019s just not true. \n\nLike, they practice, they start off, they\u2019re crap in the beginning because they have nothing in their fingers and, like, don\u2019t understand anything about music theory, composition, and they just spend an enormous amount of time building all of the understanding and skill and repertoire so that they can perform at a very high level. And, like, it\u2019s the only path to getting to the high level. Like, it\u2019s\u2013 \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  But this is available. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  It is. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  It\u2019s available to everyone in any discipline that you choose. And people \u2013 you know, the example I always get is, like, well, if you\u2019re five-foot-four, it\u2019s really hard to play in the NBA. Well, first of all, people have done it. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019d recommend it, but my guess is that you might be in love with basketball generally and there\u2019s lots of things to do around basketball if you\u2019re five-foot-four besides start on the \u2013 you know, on the Utah Jazz or, you know, the Knicks or the, you know, the Bulls or whatever. There\u2019s lots of things to do and by exploring that, you know, you\u2019re going to uncover things about yourself and things about your passions and area of interest. \n\nI think it\u2019s important to make another point, which is, you know, you talked earlier about, you know, I didn\u2019t feel qualified to be in that class with Ralph and these other people and data know \u2013 you know, look at this \u2013 I think this idea that I might not belong or that creativity is for everybody else. \n\nI want to be crystal clear. You do not need a new set of friends. You do not have to wear a beret and move to Paris and smoke the cigarettes and be \u2013 that is not what creative is. That is this romantic and I think perversely romantic view of what creativity is. None of those things are true. You can be creative right now in this moment with what you have. And, in fact, that\u2019s the only way \u2013 only place to start. Start right now, where you can with what you have and go from there. And I believe that if you start walking, you know, in the book, I talk about this sort of a calling, a curiosity, and then you put yourself on this path where you know, nothing is a waste of time, even a road where you find out that something doesn\u2019t interest you, like, that\u2019s actually a discovery in and of itself. \n\nAnd, you know, there\u2019s this toggling back and forth between lessons in creativity and our personal exploration and expression and lessons in life. \n\nThey\u2019re basically one in the same. So, you don\u2019t need a new set of friends. Even if you don\u2019t feel welcome, it\u2019s probably you more than it is the community. And if it\u2019s the community that it really is turning you off, then find a different community. But the most important thing and the thing that I feel like we do a disservice to ourselves is to not start. The list of reasons why is long. And if you\u2019re \u2013 if you do anything or take anything away from our conversation here, dear listener, it\u2019s just start. No one feels ready. Everyone starts before \u2013 you know, just, if you deconstruct the work of the most successful, happy, fulfilled people, it\u2019s that they would say, \u201cJust start.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve done the research. I\u2019ve interviewed hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people. And there\u2019s, you know, a handful of common threads. One is just start. Just begin. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. I \u2013 that is certainly consistent with what I\u2019ve seen in my cohort of peers and the people that I\u2019ve had the privilege of working with. \n\nYou know, and I guess the other thing, too, like, I\u2019ll just sort of agree with you on \u2013 the \u2013 it is way more important to, like, have the curiosity and the creative impulse and to get started than it is to, like, have a skill or a tool. If you have this creative impulse and this curiosity, you can always earn the skills and you can earn better tools so that you can make more complicated things like, you know, different things. Like, I won\u2019t even call them more interesting things, but you know, you can \u2013 \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  More advanced or \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  You\u2019d don\u2019t have to wait to get started until you have the skill or the good tool. Like, if you\u2019re waiting for that, you\u2019ll never get started. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  So true. And if you\u2019re waiting to be happy and fulfilled and rich and set before you take on this creative endeavor, you\u2019re going to be waiting forever as well. It\u2019s actually the other way around. The science is really clear here. You know, I heard it \u2013 it was my own experience, I heard it from everybody I interviewed, all of my podcast guests on Creative Live, it\u2019s the opposite. If you decide that you\u2019re creative, if you call yourself a creator and you start to apply these principles, those are the things that unlock happiness, connection, fulfillment. It\u2019s not the other way around. If you wait for happiness, fulfillment, contentment, connection in order to start this thing, whatever that thing is for you \u2013 and everybody has a thing. If you wait, you\u2019re going to be waiting forever. \n\nAnd there\u2019s, you know, the number-one regret for the dead \u2013 or the dying is that they pursued the dreams that everybody else had for them rather than their own. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  So, if on your death bed you \u2013 the thought of regret is terrifying for you, as it is for me, this is the unambiguous, virtually universal agreement is to pursue the things that you want and anything in pursuing what you want is a creative endeavor. Again, coding, building a business, a restaurant, like, any of those things. And so why wait? Those things, that pursuit in and of itself, is the initial vehicle to jumpstart your curiosity, your creativity, your positivity, your emotional connection with your capacity as a human being, which again, the thing that differentiates us from all the other species on the planet is our ability to combine unlikely things that would not have been combined for it weren\u2019t \u2013 for it not being us. \n\nAnd the last point there is you do not have to \u2013 like, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to create a symphony that\u2019s a masterpiece or nothing. That is not true. No one has experienced that, even the most talented, gifted geniuses of our time, they had to \u2013 you know, they had to create some things that weren\u2019t genius level long before they could ever, you know, truly \u2013 for, you know, be known for the things that you \u2013 the reasons that you know them. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, so, so, so true. And, like, a thing that I think a lot of people forget, because we sometimes get too enamored of the end product of fully mature genius and just sort of assume that, like, it was easy to get there, like, there weren\u2019t all of these intermediate steps or that it was, like, we \u2013 you know, we try to pretend that it wasn\u2019t hard for the, you know, for the person that\u2019s, you know, whether it\u2019s an athletic performance or like it\u2019s all \u2013 it\u2019s all hard work. (Laughter.) \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  It is, and it doesn\u2019t \u2013 the cool thing, this is why I get so passionate about helping direct people toward things they care about, because if you could fail or struggle at something that sucks, that isn\u2019t an expression of you, why would you \u2013 you know, the thought of sucking at something that you don\u2019t even care about versus like pursuing something, having a chance to pursue something that you care about \u2013 and this is not \u2013 again, this is not about quitting your job. You know, some of the happiest, you know, most balanced, fulfilled people have an amazing job that provides them resources, time, space to do the thing that they want to do on their side. This is not just about, again, quitting your job and moving to a cabin in the woods to write poetry \u2013 although, that may be someone\u2019s jam. It\u2019s not required. \n\nAgain, you can do 99% of the things that we\u2019re talking about on this show where you are right now \u2013 the thing that matters is that you start. In an imperfect, awkward way, you just start playing. And there are things in your past that when you do them, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s hitting baseballs into a field or you know, the Easy Bake Oven that you had when you were nine, like, pursue that for a little bit. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yes. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  And the cool thing is that because this is a habit, not a skill, you start to realize that this is available to everyone. And I literally mean everyone. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, I \u2013 some of my favorite stories are, you know, like Aaron Copland composing Fanfare for a Common Man and, like, you know, a bunch of his works while he was on the train to his job as an insurance executive or, you know, John Grisham I think was a lawyer, you know, while he was writing his first novels. \n\nAnd, like, the thing is, like, you\u2019re not trying to optimize for easy; you\u2019re trying to optimize for fulfilled. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  Yes. And that\u2019s a whiff for most people culturally, right? This idea of, again, you have to be successful, all these other things before you feel fulfilled. It\u2019s the other way around. Pursue things that are meaningful to you, create meaning in your life, put yourself \u2013 if you\u2019re the average of the five people you spend the most time with, put yourself around people that lift you up that are interested in the same things you are or challenge your ideas. And, you know, that vehicle creates the success downstream that it\u2019s not the other way around. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. So, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve got time for a couple more questions. We talked a little bit earlier in the conversation about how technology is changing the creative landscape. You know, we talked a little bit about how it helps people to, you know, do the \u201camplify\u201d part of idea that you can sort of put yourself out there and connect with other people. Like, it lets you build a platform like Creative Live. Like, what other ways do you think technology is changing the way that people can express their creativity? \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  Tools. Community. Like, just two completely \u2013 access. Right? Three ways that technology is completely transforming this world. You know, tools for free or cheap, you have access \u2013 I mean, you know, our phones. They\u2019re not phones anymore, they\u2019re cameras, first and foremost, recording devices, communication devices to share work, connect with others. You know, this access to the world\u2019s top experts at Creative Live, where you can have access to 2,000 classes from people like Brene Brown, Richard Branson, Damon John from Shark Tank, Tim Ferris, Sherry Riley \u2013 you want to learn about money, you want to learn about creativity, about design, about photography, like that\u2019s crazy.\n\nSo, if you think about technology in those terms, you know, it\u2019s not even kidding, it\u2019s literally transformational, the opportunity to have that. The access, again, we\u2019ve talked about that, how, you know, these \u2013 the spaces to share your work, to be a distribution platform on your own used to be reserved for the, you know, they had gatekeepers behind them, and now you can start a blog and start writing in five minutes. \n\nYou can, you know, share your photos on Instagram for free in five minutes. You can, you know, there are so many vehicles. And the community part is hard to overstate. Like, I wrote a quarter of my book is about community. That\u2019s really the whole \u201camplify\u201d section of the book is about putting yourselves around people that build you up, creating a set of, you know, fans and followers and people who like your work or want to connect with you and what you\u2019re doing are similar minded or working in areas of interest. Like, all those things are, you know, completely new as of the last 10 years and enabled by, for example, the work that you do, Kevin, at Microsoft. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Awesome. Well, I want to thank you so much for taking time to chat with us today. Everybody should go buy a copy of \u201cCreative Calling.\u201d I am \u2013 I am very much looking forward to reading the book, myself. I just want to say I\u2019m deeply appreciative of the work that you\u2019re doing, because I think nurturing this and encouraging this creative impulse in people is just such an extraordinarily important and good thing to do. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  Oh, it\u2019s just a beautiful light in my life and I\u2019m one of the few who has discovered their calling and I can\u2019t overstate how joyful \u2013 and it\u2019s not \u2013 not that easy. It\u2019s like it\u2019s not easy building a community or platform that serves, you know, millions and millions of people. You know that from your job at Microsoft. But is it fulfilling? Is it \u2013 does it feel good? It feels incredible. And, again, I\u2019m part of the process. I\u2019m connected with people all over the planet who, you know, are similar minded and believe that, you know, we are not a quirk in the tide, and we have autonomy and opportunity, and we can cultivate that and chase what we\u2019re all after, which is, you know, love and connection and fulfillment, whether that\u2019s personal or professional. \n\nSo, thank you so much for having me on the show. I love the work that you\u2019re doing at Microsoft. It\u2019s been incredible \u2013 you know, having been born and raised in Seattle and Microsoft has always been in my back yard, it\u2019s been fun to see what I would consider, you know, I\u2019ve used the word \u201ctransformational\u201d a few times in this conversation, I don\u2019t use it lightly. You all are doing incredible things over there in Redmond and beyond. And it\u2019s a new \u2013 it\u2019s a beat of a new drum over there, and it\u2019s fun to watch and I look forward to seeing more from you all in the near future. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Well, thank you so much. \n\nCHASE JARVIS:  Appreciate it. Thanks for having me on the show, Kevin. It\u2019s a dream \u2013 it\u2019s a treat. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Awesome. \n\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Well, that was Kevin\u2019s conversation with Chase Jarvis. So, I was really inspired by that conversation. You know, I\u2019m somebody who has more of a creative than technical background \u2013 at least academically. And so, a lot of this really resonated with me, especially when you were kind of \u2013 when you two were discussing creativity is habit. I thought that that was really powerful because I think that a lot of people do go into creative pursuits thinking that it has to be this instant-on thing. Like, I\u2019m either good at it or I\u2019m not. And there is a habit aspect to it that I think is really important. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, I certainly take this approach with my children, where I\u2019m less concerned about the particular creative thing that they\u2019re doing and more that they are just doing something creative. \n\nAnd, like, I have two kids, like, 10 and 12. And they \u2013 they have different creative interests. My daughter is, you know, 12 years old, just loves writing and is a voracious reader. And so, the thing that she spends her creative energy on is writing. And just \u2013 I can watch her get better and better the more she does it. And, you know, getting over that activation energy just to start to, like, whatever is stopping you, whether it\u2019s fear or like you\u2019re worried that you\u2019re not going to be good enough or that people aren\u2019t going to appreciate what you\u2019re doing, if you can get over all of that and just start, like, you will get better and better. And, like, that\u2019s the thing where just indulging in that habit is so important. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  No. I totally agree. It\u2019s interesting because I have a lot of people who still to this day ask me for advice on how to get started writing. \n\nAnd how do you do this? How are you good at this? That\u2019s always my advice, which is similar to what you and Chase were talking about, \u201cJust start.\u201d And I say to people who want to write, \u201cJust write. Do it.\u201d The more you do it, the more familiar you\u2019ll feel. It doesn\u2019t matter what it\u2019s about. It doesn\u2019t matter, you know, make it part of your day. Before I was a journalist and had to do it every day. To get ready for that, I used to journal, and I used to write every single day. It didn\u2019t matter what it was, you know, whether it was snippets of poetry or a screenplay or whatever. \n\nAnd I\u2019m convinced that that\u2019s how I worked that muscle. And I think the same is true for anything else. Like, I\u2019m sure with you and your photography or with your, you know, woodwork stuff, like, just the very factor of doing it makes you better at it. And that\u2019s certainly true, as you can attest, to coding. Right? I mean, like, that\u2019s legitimately how we all get better at it is just by doing it over and over again. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. Not only will you get better at it, it\u2019s easier to start, the more that you do it. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Yeah. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  You know, which is \u2013 so, I had a very similar experience writing. My PhD advisor told me that I should be writing every day. And I\u2019m, like, \u201cWhat do I write about?\u201d It\u2019s, like, doesn\u2019t matter, just, like, set up a discipline, like, find a place, find a time, just go write, like, even if it\u2019s typing someone else\u2019s words. Just get into the habit of doing it. \n\nAnd it really, really, really helped. It turned \u2013 it got me habituated to this whole process where you know, and he was doing it because he was getting me ready to write a dissertation and to, like, you know, get into the habit of being able to, like, produce a lot of written output, which is a lot of what being an academic is. And that just \u2013 having that habit was crucial. And I think it\u2019s true for anything. Like, whether you\u2019re a coder, whether you\u2019re \u2013 you know, like you\u2019re \u2013 you want to, like, be a creative cook and, like, make a great meal once a day, whether you \u2013 like you\u2019re a flower arranger, like, whatever it is. Like, there\u2019s so many ways to express that creativity. But, like, the only way that anyone\u2019s ever going to know how creative you are is, like, you\u2019ve just got to do it. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Yeah. You have to get out of your head and actually, you know, do it. And it can be daunting, but as you said, I think the more that you do it, the easier it becomes and the less daunting and scary it is. So \u2013 yeah. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And the more you realize how things are connected, that being creative in one thing, like, helps you be creative in another. And I think one of the things that Chase said that\u2019s really just sort of practical advice no matter, you know, what you are, like, even if you don\u2019t have the aspiration to earn your living through some sort of creative practice, like, we\u2019re all trying to create a life and, like, you want it to be a good and meaningful and fulfilling life. And so, you know, just being creative in general I think helps you just live that more fulfilling, purposeful life. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Yeah, I totally agree with that. I totally agree with that. I think that\u2019s a great place to end this. So, that\u2019s it for the show today. Thank you to Chase Jarvis for your creative inspiration.
