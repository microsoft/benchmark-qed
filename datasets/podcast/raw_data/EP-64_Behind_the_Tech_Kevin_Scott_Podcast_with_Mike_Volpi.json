{"episode": "EP-64 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Mike Volpi", "text": "MIKE VOLPI: First of all I\u2019m okay being wrong. And by the way, I\u2019m wrong all the time, so having compassion for yourself for being mistaken at times, but also continuing to have the self\u2013confidence to say, I believe in my own logic, I believe that this is going to happen, and that allows you to take certain chances.\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer and EVP of AI at Microsoft.  \nToday, tech is part of nearly every aspect of our lives. We\u2019re in the early days of an AI revolution promising to transform our lived experiences as much as any technology ever has. On this podcast, we\u2019ll talk with the folks behind that technology and explore the motivations, passion, and curiosity driving them to create the tech shaping our world. Let\u2019s get started.\n[MUSIC]\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m co\u2013host Christina Warren, senior developer advocate at GitHub. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And today, we are bringing you an interview with Mike Volpi, who is an investor and tech leader. And he\u2019s been a part of nine successful IPOs, including Confluence, Elastic, Aurora, Sonos, Slack, Pure, Zorah, Arista and Hortonworks. Wow, that\u2019s a mouthful! Incredible background.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, that\u2019s a lot of cool stuff.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I\u2019m super looking forward to this conversation because, you know, we rarely talk to people, or at least I rarely talk to people. You talk to people like this all the time. I rarely have an opportunity to, you know, hear from people who have this level of experience and investment in tech.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, Mike is super interesting, you know, in that he had such a long career at Cisco when Cisco was really at the center of the tech world. I mean, Cisco is still like an extremely important company, but, you know, it\u2019s just hard to overstate how important and central Cisco was as we were going through the internet boom, where, you know, in a very, very, very short period of time, you had to figure out how to birth the modern internet, to get everybody in the world connected to it and to get every business that already existed, a presence on the web, and then to build all of the new businesses that the web created the opportunity for. \n\nAnd so, Cisco at one point in time was just a fundamental part of the story that you were telling on all of those things. And like, Mike was just dead center of all of that at Cisco for years. \n\nAnd I think it\u2019s, you know, particularly interesting thinking about how that internet boom and like, this massive infrastructure buildout, and like this massive scramble to go create a whole bunch of things that never could have existed before back then, parallels what\u2019s going on right now in AI. And like I think him as one of the most successful investors in AI, you know, is no accident. So I\u2019m just super looking forward to this conversation with Mike.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I am, too. Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Mike Volpi is a partner at Index Ventures, a venture capital firm. He co\u2013founded the firm\u2019s San Francisco office and North American operations, and he invests primarily in artificial intelligence, infrastructure and open source companies. He spent over a decade at Cisco Systems, where he led acquisitions and built a strategy for mergers and acquisitions that\u2019s used as a model throughout the tech world. \n\nMike studied engineering at Stanford, where he earned B.S. in mechanical engineering, an MS in manufacturing systems, and an MBA. He serves on multiple boards, including Aurora, Confluent and Sonos, and he\u2019s a non\u2013executive director on the board of Ferrari. \n\nMike, thank you so much for joining us on the podcast today.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: It\u2019s so great to be here, Kevin. Thanks for having me as a guest.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So you and I have known each other for a while.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Indeed.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So I have been especially looking forward to chatting with you today. Let\u2019s just start with how you got interested in science and technology in general because you \u2013 you had a really interesting childhood and upbringing.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Yeah, I had a little bit of a different, let\u2019s say just different upbringing than most people. So I was born, I like to say, a regular Italian kid, in Milan, Italy. My parents are both from there. And I lived the first six years of my life there in Milan or the area around Milan. \n\nAnd then my dad got transferred to Tokyo. He worked for a bank, and they transferred him as an expat over to Tokyo. And then I spent the next 12 years, almost, 11.5 years in Japan, so from basically first grade all the way through high school, I went to American schools there, which is principally why I sound so American and not so Italian, disappointingly to my wife, of course. \n\nBut the interest in engineering, I think, originally came from cars. I loved cars. I mean I remember as a little kid, walls plastered with posters of Ferraris and Lamborghinis and Lancias and all that. And, you know, Italy\u2019s sort of the Mecca for the supercar, sports car, hyper\u2013car thing. \n\nAnd you know, it sort of started off with the idea of, you know, wanting to understand how those things worked and what the specs were, and, you know, what a cylinder and an engine was and all of those things. \n\nSo that really the origin of it was there. I don\u2019t even know that I really appreciated it was engineering. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: It was just like a passion for these mechanical things that did amazing stuff and raced. \n\nSo that and I mean, my dad when I was young, took me to Formula One races, which I thought was the coolest thing on earth. I went to Monza with him. I think, you know, he carried me around on his shoulder so I could see. Those are probably my first memories.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: You know, it\u2019s really interesting, though, because a lot of kids, I think, like particularly in Europe, watch Formula One, you know, with their amily or with their friends. And, you know, it\u2019s not unusual for Formula One fans to look at the driver and say, \u201cHey, I want to be the driver.\u201d Like, do you understand what it was that made you look at Formula One and say, \u201cHey, I want to actually be able to make this thing?\u201d\n\nMIKE VOLPI: I think it was, I mean, I didn\u2019t dislike the drivers, but the Formula One cars I thought looked cool, right? They looked amazing. But they \u2013 I don\u2019t think that people meant for them to look amazing. They just meant for them to look fast. And the fast would turn into amazing, right? Like it was form followed function in some sense. And I was sort of fascinated, like, I would like, design cars in the evening, like in my notebooks and stuff to make things look cool. \n\nAnd actually, there is something about in that era, because today when you think about how cars are designed, it\u2019s real engineering. It\u2019s wind tunnels and drag systems and simulations and all that. But back then it was the idea of looking fast was in the mind of a designer, of an engineer. \n\nAnd I think those ideas, and then, you know, the fact that in the end, the fastest cars had the best engine. And so, I wanted to understand, like, you know, if you didn\u2019t have that engine, you weren\u2019t going to win. And so, it\u2019s the technology that\u2019s actually making these people win, and that\u2019s what got me interested in it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, that\u2019s super interesting. You know, I\u2019m also, you know, fascinated with, you know, your dad was a banker. What did your mom do?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: My mom\u2019s a journalist.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So \u2013 and like, I don\u2019t mean this in any kind of way, but like, you know, they\u2019re not technical people, like not engineers, right? You know, so like, you know, like super, super highly successful people, but like your family or your immediate family wasn\u2019t a bunch of engineers. \n\nLike were there any other influences? Like, was it just pervasive culture thing? Like, I know both, you know, Italy and Japan are both amazing engineering countries. Like, particularly when we were growing up, like Japan in particular, was like, you know, this ascendant industrial power. Did any of that influence how you thought about the world?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Neither of my parents have done anything technical, nor are they particularly good with tech. Apparently my grandfather, who I actually have never met, he passed before I grew up, but he was a chemical engineer, and was quite the engineering mindset. \n\nI think what happened to me was I like these things. And then as I was going to school, I liked doing math. I liked the science classes. And that sort of self\u2013reinforces, you know. And after a while, you\u2019re like, oh, I\u2019m a person that likes this sort of thing. \n\nSo it wasn\u2019t so much that I was influenced per se, although in fairness, both countries, Japan, Italy, they\u2019re both countries that build a lot of mechanical systems generally. In Japan, I was probably more influenced by the electronics part of the culture because the Italians are not...you know, they don\u2019t have a great history in electronics, but the Japanese do. \n\nAnd I remember growing up a little later in life where, you know, the Walkman was the thing to own. It was like the coolest thing. And once again, like I was the kid that would get the Walkman and like, undo the screws and look inside and go like, oh, how do they do this thing? How do they make it? You know, how is it that it\u2019s so small and it does these cool things? And so, you know, I always just enjoyed like the how is something made was something that always just interested me. And it got reinforced probably because of the environments. \n\nThere\u2019s actually \u2013 you might have been there, Kevin, but in Tokyo there is an area called Akihabara, where they have an electronics district. And now it\u2019s a little \u2013 because the world has become much more software than hardware, but at the time, you know, my mom would take me there, and you could just buy anything you wanted, you know, everything from resistors and capacitors, pre\u2013made circuit boards, you know, oscilloscopes. Like anything you wanted, you could go get there. And I was like, you know, I just loved it. You know, every time my mom would take me there for the weekend, I thought it was the super \u2013 she thought it was incredibly boring, but I thought it was super cool. So it just sort of bubbled out of me, I would say. But the environment helped for sure.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, how did you get from, I guess, high school in Japan to Stanford?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: So my high school was \u2013 I went elementary, middle and high school in English. So it was kind of obvious to go to an English speaking place, to go to university. All the way through high school, science and math was my thing. So I wanted to go to a university that had more of an engineering orientation. \n\nU.S. seemed obvious. It was cool, like the U.S. was where cool things were made like, you know what? You know, the companies that we admired at the time, like I had my first computer that I had at school \u2013 it wasn\u2019t my computer, it was the school\u2019s computer, was a Commodore PET. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yep.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: It was like 64k or whatever it was, and it recorded on a cassette tape when you wanted to \u2013 you know, storage was like literally a music cassette tape. And then I got a PC that was an NEC made IBM clone. \n\nAnd all these things were American. Like Commodore was America, IBM was America. Like all this cool stuff was happening. So going to America was sort of the obvious choice. \n\nYou know, I applied to a couple of schools on the East Coast, and I applied to a couple schools on the West Coast, and the weather was a lot better on the West Coast. (Laughter.) I went to visit schools in April, and it was like 22 degrees in Cambridge and it was like, beautiful and sunny, like today is, in California. And I was like, okay, I know where I\u2019m going. So that\u2019s what got me out here.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, and in a world of no bad choices...\n\nMIKE VOLPI: I feel very fortunate. I mean, at the time, I will say, you know, in the modern era where it\u2019s so hard for people to get visas in the U.S. and stuff, because, you know, I wasn\u2019t a U.S. citizen obviously at the time. For me back then, it was actually pretty easy to go through the whole thing, get a visa, get citizenship and all that. I feel for the folks today that don\u2019t have a chance to do that as easily.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it\u2019s amazing how difficult we\u2019ve made it now. But anyway, that\u2019s a conversation for later maybe.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: That\u2019s a separate topic. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So you get to Stanford. This is in the \u201880s. And it\u2019s a really interesting time in Silicon Valley in general. So how did you \u2013 I mean, I sort of understand, like, you\u2019re mostly interested in mechanical \u2013 mechanical engineering and making mechanical things. And Mech\u2013E is a good choice because you also get to do, like a little bit of electrical engineering and software and whatnot. \n\nBut what was it like at the time? Like, was there this pull at the time towards computer science and symbolic systems and, you know, all of the software stuff that was happening in Silicon Valley or \u2013\n\nMIKE VOLPI: A bit. I would say early, early days. So for example, my mechanical engineering class had 65 graduating in my year. I think symbolic systems had six and computer science had 25. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I didn\u2019t\n\nMIKE VOLPI: I think now Stanford graduates 400 computer science majors a year. Turns out your good friend Reid was a year behind me. So I was class of \u201888, and he was class of \u201889. So I actually knew Reed there, and he was doing this. When I met him, he\u2019s like, I\u2019m a symbolic systems major. I\u2019m like, what is that? I\u2019ve never heard of that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I didn\u2019t realize you were his senpai though.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Yeah, exactly. \n\nBut I did mechanical mostly because I thought I\u2019d end up designing cars. And in mechanical at the time, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like now, but you did two sequences. You did the \u2013 thermodynamics sequence. So that\u2019s basically engine design. And then you did the mechanical design, control systems sequence. So I did both, and I thought \u2013 and I interviewed with \u2013 actually when I graduated, when I was graduating, with a bunch of car companies, actually.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, I\u2019m just sort of curious, and like, we\u2019ll get back to the interesting stuff. What was the hardest class in Mech\u2013E at the time? Because, like, I \u2013\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Ah, partial differential equations. The math. The math. Math was definitely the hardest. I mean, I was okay at math, but when we get to, like, partial \u2013 PDEs, I was like, okay,this is beyond my skill set. So the math was the hardest, I would say. \n\nThe others were \u2013 they were fun. Like, you know, I mean, the nice thing \u2013 I think for computer science, it\u2019s even more fun today because when you \u2013 when you write software, you get feedback immediately for what you\u2019ve done. Mechanical engineering is not so immediate, but it\u2019s pretty immediate, right? Because we had the PRL or the Product Realization Lab at Stanford. So, you know, you would go in. There\u2019s lathes and mills and CNC machines. And you would, you know, CAD out your system, pop it in, and boom, out comes the thing you built. And the thing you built. I mean, you only made one of them, of course, but you know, you\u2019d get it in a day, which is a pretty cool feedback loop, right? \n\nAnd so, there\u2019s \u2013 I like that a lot. I like that ability to get quick feedback on what you\u2019re doing. And also, it\u2019s practical because it\u2019s very \u2013 you know, when you make physical things, it\u2019s very tangible. You can see them and feel them. So there was a lot of reinforcement, positive reinforcement in that major. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, you know, I kind of feel like an old man dispensing advice, but  I think other than actually making things being fun, I think it\u2019s necessary. If the reason that you\u2019re studying engineering is because you want to make things exist in the world that never existed before, you want to, like, create some effects, like you actually have to do stuff at some point. And the quicker you can start doing stuff where you are actually making the things that you\u2019re trying to understand theoretically. Like, the quicker you learn and the better your career is going to be. \n\nAnd it always struck me as weird because like, when I was learning computer science right around the same time, it was really a fashionable thing to teach computer science in a way where your fingers didn\u2019t touch the keyboard. So it was like a bunch of analysis.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Yes, the theory of computer science.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And so, it\u2019s interesting, but, like, it\u2019s just not the same as actually doing a thing.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Yeah. No, I totally agree. I think that, you know, that feedback loop of making something that does, you know, responds then to some behavior that you exhibit, is for a lot of people, it\u2019s super powerful. You can do a lot of theories of things and understand why they work. But that feedback loop to me is super fun. \n\nAnd I think the other thing that I find that, you know, I graduated with a mechanical engineering degree. I worked as a mechanical engineer for years, but I\u2019ve not really been a mechanical engineer for a long time. \n\nHowever, the methodology of saying, like, I want a thing to end up doing this for me, in order for it to do this for me, I have to break it into a composite set of parts, and then I have to take each part apart and build and, you know, successively build it so that it plugs in together and then becomes that.\n\nThat mindset of parsing problems, which is of really the engineering mindset, I think it\u2019s extraordinarily helpful everywhere. I mean, I find that it\u2019s helpful in business and thinking about how to achieve business goals and so forth. \n\nSo foundationally, I mean, obviously it\u2019d be great if we graduated more engineers in the world because I think we can always use more. But even if you end up doing something else in life, I still think it\u2019s an unbelievable foundation for somebody to start with.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And were you \u2013 so we\u2019ve already talked about you being sort of a curious kid. So you were, like taking things apart to try to understand how they work. Then, you know, you\u2019re just like, drawn to complexity, not daunted by it. But were you also a skeptical kid?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Let\u2019s see. I wouldn\u2019t say that I was extraordinarily skeptical. I mean, I think. I didn\u2019t like it when people BS\u2019d about things, when people made up stuff that I couldn\u2019t then sum up in my own mind, right? If you say like, it\u2019s X and then you go like, well, how is X composed, and that doesn\u2019t really kind of make sense, I didn\u2019t like that very much. But I was aspirational, as in like I always felt drawn to the idea of creating something that doesn\u2019t exist today. \n\nSo in that sense, I did have some skepticism, but I was more motivated by what\u2019s around the corner, what\u2019s next, what\u2019s cool and how can it be practical, right, how can it be useful day one? \n\nAnd I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get to some conversation about AI, but there\u2019s also distinction there about like, oh, well, it\u2019s this amazing thing over there. But I always try to think about, you know, how is this practical for me today as opposed to just pure vision? Like, I like aspirational, but I like it to the extent that I can practically apply it to what I do today.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, which I think is \u2013 it\u2019s a good impulse. \n\nSo you graduate Stanford, and then you go get a job as a mechanical engineer. What \u2013 what was \u2013 what was that job? What were you doing?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: I was a product designer, a product design engineer for HP in the optoelectronics division. So we made \u2013 HP at the time made various things that used gallium arsenide semiconductor material to create light. And, you know, you make a lot of products that create light. That can be everything from displays to automotive components to fiber optic connectors to all sorts of things. But I was an engineer in the group there. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And what did that look like? Because I think when people hear things like that, like depending on what your background is, you summon up a bunch of different images, you know, were you\u2019re sitting at a desk all day, doing schematics and drawings. Were you in a lab tinkering around with stuff? Were you with customers, like helping them build things?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: No, I was pretty much \u2013 so a mechanical engineer\u2019s principal tool are CAD/CAM. So HP had its in\u2013house CAD/CAM system. I got \u2013 grew up on AutoCAD and CATIA, which were the kind of industry standards, but HP didn\u2019t use those. So I was on ME10, ME30, which at the time ran on workstations, big computers that with your desk, you design this thing. It\u2019s a three dimensional renderer that you did stuff and you like designed it in various shapes and forms. \n\nAnd then typically, you would design one out, you would send it out to the prototyping shop, they would make it, then you would test it. So you would take it into a lab. And you know, in my case it had to have certain thermal characteristics. \n\nSo it was an interesting job because it involved both thermal \u2013 well, when semiconductors are pounded hard with electricity, they create heat. And when you create heat, the performance degrades, and also it creates \u2013 if you involve it with plastic, it melts plastic around it. \n\nSo I had to do a lot of thermal stuff to make sure that we weren\u2019t overheating these systems, and then mechanical design to make them fit into certain mechanical spaces was what I was doing.\n\nThey would \u2013 I would design it. The prototype shop would build it up. We would test it. And then when it was tested enough to our satisfaction, we would send it over to what was called New Product Introduction Engineering, NPIE. Those were the guys that basically took our designs and turned them into a production line that they would make them. \n\nAt the time, our products were made in Malaysia, so we had a bunch of NPIEs over in Malaysia that would take our product design and then put them in and try to build them. And, you know, usually you made something and it didn\u2019t work. So then you had to go, you know, spin it another time and do it right. \n\nBut it was probably \u2013 yeah I mean, it\u2019s a long time ago, but I\u2019d say 30% of the time, CAD/CAM 30% of the time working with other people to, you know, facilitate, and a bunch of time testing, and test eval was a lot of time. And we had to run a lot of tests that ran long periods of time, and then we had to do temperature chambers to cycle them and those sorts of things. So that was basically the job.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Interesting. And so, at some point, you made the shift from being a mechanical engineer at a Silicon Valley company to like being more actively involved in software. Like, how did that happen?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Well, I always did a bit of \u2013 so I was programing in BASIC in high school. I programed a little bit in Fortran also in high school. I took a bunch of Pascal classes in college. So it was, you know, it was sort of there. \n\nIt\u2019s funny, I was talking to my \u2013 my dad\u2019s always been a good advisor, mentor to me. And he \u2013 mechanical engineering, he can understand. But when I was like, well, because when I was thinking of majors, I was like, ME, maybe CS. I asked my dad and he\u2019s like, \u201cComputer science, that\u2019s like games and stuff. You don\u2019t want to do that. That\u2019s a really bad career path. Stick with mechanical engineering. Way better.\u201d It\u2019s like, thanks for the advice, dad, really appreciate it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It worked out for you.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: I could have been \u2013 you know, if he hadn\u2019t given me the advice, I could be CTO at Microsoft right now.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, you made the right choices, my friend. (Laughter.) \n\nMIKE VOLPI: But yeah. So I always played around with software. But what actually happened is my boss at HP had an MBA. He was the manager of the engineering group that I was working in. And, you know, he  liked me a lot and was very kind to me. And he, you know, he was like, you know, for an engineer, you ask a lot of why questions, like why are we doing this? This product doesn\u2019t seem to make sense. Why? You know, what\u2019s the \u2013 you know, why are we making this one instead of that one? And why is that division over there? So he said, you should really go and explore the business world to kind of understand, and you should get an MBA. \n\nSo my third year, at three years of engineering, I applied to business schools, and I decided to leave and go to \u2013 my manager actually wrote my letter of recommendation, and I had decided to go to business school to sort of understand the business likes of it, not knowing what I would do afterwards. I assumed maybe I\u2019d go back to doing what I was doing before, but I\u2019d learn it. \n\nAnd I think that\u2019s where sometimes in your career you get lucky because doors open. But in my second year of business school, I was organizing a conference, a technology conference for the business school at Stanford. We were inviting these speakers to do things. \n\nAnd originally back then, this is circa 1990 \u2013 early 1994, when you advertised the conference, you would put posters up around campus, say, you know, come by, we have these speakers, whatever. \n\nAnd one of my friends was like, well, we shouldn\u2019t do posters, we should do a website. And I was like, what\u2019s a website? And they\u2019re like, oh, there\u2019s this thing called the web. And I was like, oh, like the thing that you do email on? Because we had email. I even had email at work back then, but the web wasn\u2019t a thing. \n\nAnd in early \u201894, what was then Mosaic and then eventually became Netscape had launched the web server, web browser. And so, instead of making posters, we made a website, and we would have \u2013 we had a very simple little database where you could enter your email, and then we would then follow up with an invitation on email. \n\nAnd, you know, it got me to exploring the internet and that, you know, the light bulb went off. You know, seeing the web, I was like, wow, like, this is \u2013 nobody\u2019s ever going to make posters anymore. It was one of those luminary moments. \n\nBut no, I sort of got the bug. And then I actually said, like, whatever I\u2019m doing, I have to find a job that has to do with the web, like, doesn\u2019t matter what. And at the time, \u201894, eBay was started in \u201895, Yahoo was started in \u201895. There literally weren\u2019t \u2013 there were no internet companies in \u201894. \n\nAnd so, then typical engineering mindset, and I was like, well, if there\u2019s no like web companies, like, how\u2019s the internet made? And I started doing research on how the internet works. And there\u2019s this thing called TCP/IP, and there\u2019s routers and switches. I was like, well, who makes those? There\u2019s a company called Cisco makes them. \n\nSo I like I cold called the CEO. I just like \u2013 and at the time, you actually called people, literally cold call people. And his assistant was nice enough to put me through, and I chatted with him for a bit.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And this was \u2013 this was [John] Chambers at the time?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: No, this was still the first CEO was a guy called John Morgridge. John was nice enough to, like, literally take my call. And he invited me down, and I did a few interviews and got passed around. And finally the guy, the CTO, actually, of the company hired me to be his sort of technical assistant basically. It\u2019s like you come and do whatever I tell you to do.\n\nAnd then one thing led to another, but it was literally like that conference and making a website. Like I just, you know, we got on \u2013 my friend and I got on, made some HTML stuff, and I was just like, hooked.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: What did that job look like at Cisco? So like you were the TA to the CTO. Like, what were some of the technical problems that you all were trying to sort out? You know, this is what, \u201895?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Yeah. So well, really \u201894, \u201895. So the first context, Cisco was a small company then. It was about 2,000 employees. It was very informal. We had grown up very, very fast. The company was a couple hundred million in revenue, I want to say. And so, roles were a lot less formal than roles are today in the organization. \n\nThey basically hired me because there were two technological themes that could affect their core business. They had routing, and they had two technological themes. One was broadband to the home, right, because back then, it was all dial-up. And so, they wanted to evaluate broadband technologies. And then the other one was that the \u2013 there\u2019s a technology that sits right next to routing called switching, which is sort of a more hardware-oriented approach to moving packets on the internet, which they were afraid would disrupt routers. Turns out to be true; it did. But they were worried that that technology could obsolete routers. And we had to evaluate from a business development perspective whether we should be making acquisitions in that sector. \n\nSo those are the two projects I got a chance to work on with the CTO. The broadband work led to essentially us partnering and investing with a few of the cable companies to make cable modems. So they were invented at Cisco. And then on the switching side, we ended up acquiring a bunch of companies, like four of them, including Andy Bechtolsheim\u2019s company at the time, to build the entire switching product line at Cisco via acquisition. And that turned out to eventually become the largest part of Cisco.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s kind of incredible that you were there helping to sort all of this stuff out strategically, right as the internet was beginning to take off.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Yeah, well, I think what was, what I learned to really appreciate at the time was my boss at the time, the CTO, was very good at sort of seeing, okay, this is what we\u2019re doing today. It\u2019s great. Business is humming. We love it. But there are things that might happen two years from now that will dramatically disrupt what we\u2019re doing. And all this happy stuff that\u2019s happening now will finish in three years if we don\u2019t pay attention to that next thing. Right? And that, you know, the natural tendency of a business that\u2019s going well is to just keep doing what it\u2019s doing. And he was very good at saying, like uh-uh, like that\u2019s the exact moment that you have to go and lean in to the thing that might kill you. \n\nAnd I think I was mostly there helping, because he was a big strategic thinker, but was not very good, not very hands on. And so, I was like hands for him. So he would say like, okay, go explore that one, go do this, talk to this guy over here. \n\nAnd in the process of doing the work for him, osmosis set in. And I was like, oh, that\u2019s how I got to look at the world of business, and that\u2019s how it works. And it\u2019s like being an engineer, and you\u2019re like sort of sitting there saying, oh, if only we did it this way, this can create another opportunity over here, right? That was the biggest lesson for me at the time.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, you were at Cisco actually for quite a long while. So 10 years, as far as Silicon Valley, 10 years ago is, I mean, that\u2019s a long tenure. I mean, by Microsoft standards, like people stay here for, like, we just \u2013\n\nMIKE VOLPI: No, it was even longer. \n\nMIKE VOLPI: Oh, was it?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: So it was 14 years I was there. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So well, I guess two questions then. So like one, like what made you stay so long when I\u2019m sure every month there was some new opportunity? Like you had this great career. You were probably getting called all the time to come do other things. Like you could have stopped being at Cisco at any point. Like, what was the thing that kept you there for as long as you did? \n\nAnd then I\u2019d love to understand, like, you know, when you finally did decide to move on, like, why did you choose what came next?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Net-net two reasons, I think. The first was that my role kept changing, and I was learning something new. So I was doing more or less corp \u2013 what today I would characterize as corp dev and strategy work for the first six years there, until like 2000. \n\nAnd then I was kind of ready to leave at that point. And then John Chambers, who was the CEO, said, well, if you want to be a real, you know, a businessman, you need to own a business. Like, you\u2019re just sort of like a deal guy. So you should really learn that here. And he gave me the opportunity to take that switching business, which I mentioned a minute ago, that we had assembled through acquisition and become the general manager for that. \n\nThat meant that I was now, you know, I went from managing like 50 people to managing like 3,000 people. And we were doing everything from chips, so we had teams that were designing the silicon, the custom silicon, the electrical engineering, the mechanical stuff, thermal stuff, software, core OS software, application layer software, management software, all that stuff in the product, plus product management, product marketing. So it was a essentially a GM of that business. \n\nAnd I just thought to myself, well, this is an amazing experience. Like, who gives a kid who\u2019s never \u2013 like, I literally went from being an IC engineer to managing 3,000 people, you know, less than 10 years later. And I thought this was really good learning.\n\nSo that, you know, I had that business unit. Then they gave me more, and then they gave me more. So every time I thought I was \u2013 different competitors different challenges in the market, different customer sets, I went from, like selling stuff to Wall Street trading floors to selling the big routers to internet service providers, people like Verizon and Comcast. More customer interaction, which I found super fun. \n\nSo I felt like I was constantly learning. That was one.\n\nAnd two, and Kevin, I\u2019m guessing you feel some of this as well being at Microsoft, you know, you are at the \u2013 you know, it\u2019s \u2013 Cisco is not as much of a center stage company today as it was back then, but then it was very center stage. Like, every opportunity, every important event that happened in and around the internet was coming through. One way or another, you were touching it. \n\nAnd so, you get spoiled because you\u2019re at the big boys\u2019 table. You know, you\u2019re sort of like, yeah, I\u2019m really moving the big chess pieces around this thing. And I had a very good relationship with our CEO, and he really brought me into, I mean, I was at all the board meetings and everything. And so, that was fun. Being \u2013 feeling like it\u2019s center stage and I\u2019m learning a lot was amazing. \n\nThe thing that got to it is at some point, networking lost its glamour. It was sort of like, you know, you don\u2019t \u2013 well, now you think about networking because of the data centers, you go nuts.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Oh my gosh, it\u2019s back again, man.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Back again. But for a while there, it got a little sleepy, right? It was just like, eh, you know, you plug in, the internet works, who cares? \n\nAnd also I got to age 40. So, you know, I ended up spending 14 years there. I started when I was 26. And it was just one of those life moments where like, yeah, am I going to be a lifer here, or is there something else to do in life?\n\nSo that \u2013 sort of those two, like the sleepiness of the business and the realization that I just had to do something different in life. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So why become an investor?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: The investor thing happened later. So I thought I was going to be an operator for a long time. So I ended up joining, through some friends that I had at Sequoia, I ended up joining a company in their portfolio called Joost, which was doing \u2013 was basically today, you would call that Hulu or Netflix. They were streaming video. \n\nI was CEO for two years. I learned what I didn\u2019t know, which is I understand the tech. I had no clue on the content side. All the stuff about content licensing and rights and copyright and all this stuff, no clue. So it was good tech, terrible content, company went pretty much nowhere. It ended up getting acquired. \n\nAnd I had gotten, because of my corp dev background, I had gotten a lot of calls from a lot of VCs over the years. And then my good friend Danny Rimer at Index, who was on my board, said, why don\u2019t we just give this VC thing a go? And you know, I had thought about the idea, but I never thought I would be a VC. It was \u2013 I liked products, and I thought I was \u2013 I\u2019m a product person. \n\nAnd \u2013 but then, you know, maybe it was also a little bit because the startup journey was so shitty. Like, it really didn\u2019t work, and I felt maybe a little defeated. I was like, well, maybe I\u2019m not a product person. I\u2019m just like a sort of a tech trends kind of a guy. \n\nAnd you know, I enjoyed my corp dev time at Cisco, and maybe VC is like that. So, you know, I decided to join forces with Danny and become a venture capitalist. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But, like, I do think you are a product guy, and, like, you\u2019re a pretty \u2013 you\u2019re like, technical. Like the just \u2013 I mean, I remember one of the first times we met, you know, like, you\u2019re citing research papers to me, and, you know, like, you\u2019re constantly reading, like, a bunch of highly technical literature. \n\nAnd so, do you think that that has helped you be a better investor, that you\u2019ve got this curiosity and like you\u2019ve got all of the foundation there where you can just sort of dive deep into really gnarly technical stuff?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Yeah, 100%. I mean, you know, what I\u2019ve learned over the years is that I\u2019m sort of this weird product as a human being that is both very keen on technology and understanding why things work and so forth. But I also \u2013 I like to jump around a little bit and see different things with different context. You know, I call that like professional ADHD. But I have both this love of tech and professional ADHD.\n\nAnd the venture thing, I think, worked out because at least the way I prosecuted it, it was always a game of like seeing a lot of different things, seeing how they fit together, understanding how they work. \n\nAnd I do think one of the most important things, there\u2019s a lot \u2013 you know, you can have very different styles of investors. Some investors are just very good at seeing heat and jumping on it. \n\nI fancy myself as an investor that is good at understanding when a technology can actually become a business. And I think in that context, being technical enough because I can\u2019t, you know, I can\u2019t write code. I mean, I can write a little bit of code, but nothing that would ever become a product. But I can read a paper and know and go like, ah, you know, this is cool, but this doesn\u2019t feel like it can be part of a business. Or maybe this is a little too early, or it\u2019s not far enough along.\n\nSo that, you know, that ability to assess a technology\u2019s maturity and its ability to become a product is how I\u2019ve hung my hat as a venture capitalist. And that doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the only style, but for me, it\u2019s worked.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, so I think that\u2019s a good segue into AI because like, I think  you\u2019ve made some of the most interesting investments in AI. And I would argue that AI is an especially difficult thing to invest in because it\u2019s changing very rapidly, it\u2019s kind of complicated. Like, there\u2019s some strategic stuff that, you know, I think a handful of years ago wasn\u2019t obvious at all that is, you know, that you have to be able to see early or like, otherwise you\u2019re going to be too late. \n\nLike you, you invested in Scale, which is like one of the truly interesting data companies. You invested in Cohere, which is like one of the most amazing teams in the era of generative AI that\u2019s building a really interesting business. \n\nI guess the other thing too, you know, now a lot of this stuff seems obvious, but like a handful of years ago, like all \u2013 almost all of the things that people are excited about right now, most folks, you know, investors and tech executives and, you know, lots and lots of super smart people were like, yeah, this is nonsense, you know, that like none of this is going to work. Like, you know, you guys are just full of crap. \n\nSo, like, how did you decide that this was interesting and you wanted to go deep on it?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, in some ways you look back at my life, and the dots always connect in a similar way. And so, what actually happened to me was that I got really interested in Waymo or back then, Google\u2019s self-driving program. I thought that was like, super technically cool. And even though I was a little skeptical about the timeframes they were talking about, I was very interested in how it worked. \n\nSo I started doing some research on some of the core elements of the technology there, and the thing that popped up was deep learning for computer vision, right? So that was \u2013 and I was like, okay, what is this deep learning thing? \n\nSo, you know, you wind the tape back and you go back to like ImageNet and AlexNet and you go back to like, you know, basically what machine learning systems look like and how they were applying them in multiple methodologies, because at the time, self\u2013driving was not one big model, but it was like a series of separate models, some for vision, some for motion planning and so forth. And that got me pretty interested. \n\nAnd so, basically I started chasing ideas around self-driving. Ended up meeting a common friend of ours, Chris Urmson, invested in his company. And that\u2019s, you know, one of the beautiful things about investing is that you meet these incredibly smart people, and they\u2019ll actually teach you how this thing works, right? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: So I was sitting there with Drew Bagnell, who\u2019s the CTO, and he\u2019s just like, literally giving me a PhD level class on how this stuff works. And they were like, yeah, we need to use labeled data. I was like, all right, well, label. And so, they explained to me why, you know, vision objects need a label. And I was like, well, how do you get labels? And it was like, well, people have to put labels on it. I was like, really? How do you do that? And he was like, well, we use this company called Scale. So he was like, ah, that\u2019s interesting, let me introduce you. So I went and met Alex and he was like, look, this labeling stuff, you know, it seems mundane, but, you know, in order to train machines, you need that. \n\nAnd this is way before LLMs. Like, LLMs were \u2013 this is 2016. So they hadn\u2019t even written the Attention Paper yet. Google hadn\u2019t published their BERT stuff and so forth. \n\nSo you know, a lot of it was when Alex explained, Alex Wang was the CEO at Scale, explained to me why this was important, and it just resonated with me that we would need a lot of labels in the world, like over and over again we would need them. And people said like, well, we\u2019ll do simulation. And I was like, yeah, I don\u2019t see how simulation is going to work exactly well here. Like I think \u2013 \n\nSo I bought the story. We invested in that company. And then, you know, one thing leads to another. Because \u2013 because you do computer vision, you see robotics. So we invested in Covariant. The Covariant guys are friendly with Geoff Hinton and the folks at University of Toronto. That\u2019s where Cohere is. So we get connected to them. And, you know, one thing leads to another. \n\nI think at the time, to be honest, Kevin, a bunch of my partners thought I had lost my marbles because, like, nobody invested in AI in 2017, and much less like, you know, OpenAI was a nonprofit at the time, and people were like, well, how do you invest in a nonprofit that, you know, you don\u2019t make money from nonprofit? Big mistake. \n\nBut it just struck me at the time that humans are in some sense the pinnacle of biological technology. Like we are, as far as we know, at the top of the pyramid of biological technology. And I felt like a system that would not copy it, but attempted to emulate how humans worked, and did so via computer system, had to have a really, really bright future. Like it just was sort of like saying the horse is the best instrument we have to move around. If I only could build a mechanical system that mimicked a horse, I could actually improve productivity a lot. And somebody invented a car, right? \n\nAnd in the same way, like a human is the best brain system that we know of. And if you try to, you know, like a car is not a horse. They\u2019re very different instruments, but they serve a similar purpose. \n\nAnd that\u2019s at least how I think of AI, which is actually AI systems don\u2019t really work like the human brain. They sort of loosely, but they serve the same benefit at the end. They just, because of the nature of scaling and computing, they can be much bigger. \n\nAnd so, that sort of like that light bulb went off, and I was like, I don\u2019t care what my partners think; this is it, like we\u2019re doing this. And so, I did a series of investments and got more and more involved.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And it is \u2013 maybe just talk a little bit more about how \u2013 I mean, maybe this is a thing that\u2019s run through your whole career. Like it\u2019s \u2013 difficult sometimes to, like see a thing and have conviction in it and say, like I got to go do this. And like everybody else around you is like, yeah, this is dumb, and we don\u2019t understand it. And you somehow or another summon something, you know, whether it\u2019s contrariness or, you know, like some kind of primal determination or, you know, like cold, rational calculus or whatever it is, but like, it\u2019s sort of tough to row against the current, so to speak. And like it \u2013 you know, it sounds to me like, just sort of listening to you talk over the past hour, like that\u2019s a lot of what you\u2019ve done over the course of your career.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Yeah, I think, Kevin, maybe \u2013 you know, maybe you feel some of this stuff the same way, which is when I\u2019m wrong about stuff, I tend to be wrong because I\u2019m too early on it. Like, I see things, and I can understand how you can get there, but maybe it takes five years instead of two, and then I\u2019m wrong about it. And so, what I try to do in my own mind when I look at things is say, well, that\u2019s my natural tendency. I tend to underestimate the amount of time it takes to get there. \n\nApplying that filter of bias when I look at something, do I think that it has extraordinary potential and within a reasonable time frame can I nail that? If I\u2019m convinced of that, if I\u2019m convinced that it can work in my own sort of architecture in my head, don\u2019t really care much about how other people feel about it. \n\nBecause I think a lot of other people are either too aspirational at times, you know, they\u2019re selling you like pass the hash pipe type things, or they\u2019re in the mindset of like, yeah, that\u2019ll never work. Yeah, that\u2019ll never work. Right. It\u2019s most people I find are in those corners. \n\nAnd I think that actually a really good way to be a businessperson is to find that happy medium in our industry. And that\u2019s important because the majority of people are not going to be where you are. So you really have to build your own belief system based on essentially logic of why it is that I believe this. \n\nAnd if I really believe it, first of all, I\u2019m okay being wrong. And by the way, I\u2019m wrong all the time, so having compassion for yourself for being mistaken at times, but also continuing to have the self\u2013confidence to say, I believe in my own logic, I believe that this is going to happen, and that allows you to take certain chances. \n\nHonestly, I think on AI, I was maybe a little bit early. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nMIKE VOLPI: But, you know, more or less it\u2019s worked out.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And sometimes, you know you even have to ask yourself as an investor, you know, like whether you\u2019re a venture capitalist or you\u2019re a chief technology officer, like what the cost of being early versus late is, and, like, where you want to be biased. So yeah, with AI, like I think it\u2019s probably worse to be late than it was to be early.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: I think you\u2019re completely right. I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 I think today, it\u2019s very, very tough to be an AI investor. It is very hard. For one, the industry has matured where it\u2019s become a large players\u2019 game because the capital required is massive. Two, the minute you have an idea, since everybody wants to throw capital behind it, 37 companies appear that do the same thing. So I think it\u2019s really hard now. \n\nI mean, in some ways, it\u2019s like you show up today and you go like, oh, I\u2019m going to do AI. It\u2019s like, okay, where\u2019s the insight there? Like, you know? Being early, you know, you have to convince a lot of people. And you had to do this at Microsoft, I\u2019m sure, when you were thinking through the AI stuff, like you have to convince a bunch of people that this was worth it because they were saying, ah, it\u2019s been done forever, it never works. You know, it\u2019s been 30 years. This stuff never works, you know? And you have to be like, no, no, no, but this is actually the moment. Trust me, this is the moment. \n\nAnd maybe you were probably a little bit on the early side, too.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: A little bit.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: But at least you weren\u2019t overpopulated with like a thousand people doing the same.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Correct. Yeah. We were early, I think, but like, right on the verge. Like, if you just sort of look at how things have unfolded, like if \u2013 and there are some things, by the way, where I\u2019m like, I just really desperately wish that I\u2019d been six months earlier. Like, really. Like, I mean, it\u2019s a small handful of things. We can talk about those, like off the air. But like, there\u2019s a handful of things where I\u2019m like, just six months made such a tremendous difference where, you know, it\u2019s just a big pain in my ass that like, I didn\u2019t see it just a little bit sooner.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Yeah. Yeah, I would say I probably have a few things that I went a little too soon. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nMIKE VOLPI: But, you know, at the end of the day, you know, sometimes you\u2019re going to \u2013 you\u2019re going to catch them just right. But, you know, the truth of the matter is you can never in this business tell. And in particular, you know, the world we live in, in AI, the curve is so steep that those \u2013 it\u2019s six months in human time, but in technology development time, it\u2019s like four years, right? So it is a very tricky thing to pace in time because the rapidity of the velocity of change, you know, the delta is so high right now in this sector.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So maybe last couple of questions. What do you think is interesting going forward, either in AI or, you know, like anything else that\u2019s sort of happening in technology that you think is interesting, that people ought to be paying more attention to than they are?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Look, I think there\u2019s a couple things in the AI side that I pay attention to. One is the physical embodiment of AI, which is interesting. I think the AI we experience through Bing Chat or ChatGPT or Cohere or whatever is the purely digital experience right now. \n\nAnd I think that, you know, we are analog beings, and at some level there needs to be a physical experience associated with that of some variety. So whether it\u2019s, you know, robotics or it\u2019s devices or, you know, other things that allow a more physical embodiment of what we perceive to be AI, I think is super interesting. \n\nI do pay attention to technologies other than transformers. I think this is an investor bias. I don\u2019t see how investors can, you know, startup investors can win in transformers now anymore because of the capital requirements of it. And I would say for now, there is no obvious scaling boundaries to transformers, but maybe there might be. And if so, might there be a different approach? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Maybe, maybe not. But it\u2019s my job to explore.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And for listeners who may not be AI people, like when we \u2013 when Mike is saying transformers, he\u2019s not talking about Optimus Prime. Like, this is the \u2013 \n\nMIKE VOLPI: Oh yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: This is the prevailing architecture for deep neural networks that is basically driving all of this crazy scale-based progress right now.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Yeah, exactly. I mean, everything that everybody experiences today in AI is largely based on this technology called transformers. And it has very good scaling characteristics, meaning that, you know, if you throw more computing power at it, it just gets better and better and better. \n\nThat\u2019s not generally true with technology. Technology usually has a plateauing effect. Like, you can throw more resources at it, but the pace at which it improves flattens over time. And this particular technology has not shown characteristics of flattening so far. \n\nBut it also means that the resources required get massive. So it needs a lot of power, a lot of computers, a lot of data centers, all that stuff. Very hard for a small company to survive.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Very hard for a large company. \n\nMIKE VOLPI: Yeah, no kidding. Yeah. Good for coal in West Virginia. \n\nSo yeah. So those sorts of things I\u2019m enjoying and trying to pay attention to, to see, you know, is there something around the corner.\n\nOutside of the AI space, I mean, I think it\u2019s still sort of AI related, but the intersection between AI and medicine is an area that I\u2019ve been paying a lot of attention to. I think that we\u2019re even earlier in the stages of that. I think that sector of the world will have hopefully a ChatGPT-like moment at some point where we define \u2013 you know, we can design a vaccine in three weeks. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nMIKE VOLPI: Or find a drug that, you know cures or addresses diabetes or something like. And that\u2019s the other field that I am paying attention to.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Super cool. \n\nWell, last question, and I ask this of everyone on the show, so. You have this super interesting day job, and you, you know, in addition to being an investor, you get to do cool things, like be on the board of Ferrari. What do you do outside of work, whatever it is that means, for fun?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: I do a little bit of sports just to keep it real, play tennis, ski, that sort of thing. I read a lot. I actually hate business books. I think I read a lot of them, and I\u2019m totally done with them. But I particularly enjoy books that recount either people\u2019s lives, who had some fascinating involvement with the evolution of technology, or stories about how technology came to fruition, like how a technology became something that\u2019s part of our lives. I find those things absolutely fascinating. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Do you have a favorite recent one?\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Yeah. So there\u2019s one called \u2013 that I recently \u2013 called The Empires of Light, which is the story of the war between Tesla doing AC and Edison doing DC, and how basically Tesla lost. I mean, he died crazy and poor, and Edison won. But actually, the technology Tesla developed turned out to be the right technology. So we all use AC at home. \n\nAnd there\u2019s a whole interesting sort of business subtext to the creation of the technology, and there\u2019s a lot of, you know, what made Edison a great entrepreneur, maybe not such a great technologist, but a very good entrepreneur, what made Tesla a great technologist, but actually a pretty pathetic entrepreneur, his relationship with George Westinghouse and so forth. \n\nSo fascinating book that really teaches you about how, you know, because oftentimes we sort of simplify and we say like, oh, well, the best technology wins or the best technology never wins, and neither one is true. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Correct.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: You sort of \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of sort of permutations. So that\u2019s a fascinating book that I play around with. \n\nAnd then I go to the occasional Formula One race to enjoy the same thing I enjoyed when I was six. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s awesome. Super, super cool. \n\nWell, this has been an amazing conversation. Thank you so much for taking time out to chat with us today.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: Kevin, it\u2019s always a pleasure. We have to do this more often. And, like, you know, maybe we can do the version of this that doesn\u2019t \u2013 that isn\u2019t shielded by Microsoft secrecy, in person.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Absolutely. All right, man.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: All right, Kevin, thank you.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Okay. Well, that was a fantastic conversation with Mike Volpi. And as you were kind of, you know, discussing the \u2013 before your interview with him, his background, I mean, is so fascinating because as you mentioned, he had this experience at Cisco where he was for 14 years. And as you mentioned, you know, it was kind of the center of kind of, you know, the dot-com kind of boom and kind of the first real internet web boom, and continues to be very successful. \n\nAnd what really struck me though was, you know, you have this person who\u2019s obviously brilliant, goes to Stanford, studies mechanical engineering, and, you know, was working in engineering at Cisco, and then says, I want to learn about the business. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And goes and gets an MBA. \n\nI \u2013 I\u2019ve met a lot of, you know, entrepreneurs, I\u2019ve met a lot of technologists. I know a number of MBAs, I \u2013 it\u2019s fairly uncommon. Has that been your experience? I don\u2019t know a ton of people who have had previous, you know, interest in the business side, who are, you know, engineering majors, who\u2019ve decided, no, I want to go get my MBA.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, like, there\u2019s some. I mean like, quite famously my boss is one of them. \n\nBut, you know, it is an interesting thing, like, particularly at that point in time when you are sitting, you know, you\u2019re sort of sitting in Silicon Valley at one of the boom moments. And, you know, maybe that\u2019s even a weird thing to say because Silicon Valley has more or less been booming for, you know, five decades plus now. \n\nBut, you know, the \u201880s and \u201890s when he was like an undergrad and grad student were like an especially active time in Silicon Valley. And, you know, I know a lot of people who just don\u2019t even want to get an undergraduate degree because they\u2019re afraid that they\u2019re going to miss out on something. \n\nAnd so, you know, I think it\u2019s one of the things that I really do respect about Mike is that his curiosity is broad versus narrow. And so, like, he\u2019s just constantly trying to fill in the gaps in his experience so that he can give himself even more permission to be more curious. And I think that\u2019s what going to B-school was was about. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Oh, totally.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s him, you know, like being an engineer and realizing, okay, well, like, engineering without context is not super interesting. So, like, let me go figure out how to get context. \n\nAnd then, you know, as we heard, you know, the more curious you are, like I think the more opportunities you create for yourself because, you know, him being at B-school is the thing that created the connection for him to go to Cisco.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right. Right. No, which again, I mean, I think is so fascinating, right, that he had that curiosity and that kind of instinct to go to the next place, which has clearly set him up for all the stages in his career, both at Cisco doing the, you know, investment and biz dev stuff, and then as a CEO and now as an investor.\n\nI really enjoyed the conversation that the two of you had about being too early versus too late because I think that that\u2019s one of those conversations that people could have kind of endlessly for hours, right? \n\nBut I did kind of want to ask you; what was it about AI in this moment \u2013 let me be more specific \u2013 this moment in AI that we\u2019re having, this moment, you know, with transformers and with generative AI and whatnot, that made you make the case to make some of the investments that Microsoft has made and to be one of the, you know, earlier, you know, people who\u2019s kind of involved with that? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, for me, it was that I saw in 2017 really, 2016, 2017, that these systems were really doing interesting things as they scaled up, and that they behaved more like a platform with greater scale. \n\nAnd so, one of the things that I had been skeptical about with AI and, you know, and I have been episodically skeptical about AI for most of my career. So when I was an undergraduate and in grad school, we were in an AI winter. So like, we had in the, you know, early mid-\u201980s, like people got super enthusiastic about AI and, you know, like lots of energy and lots of people studying it and lots of companies forming. And we \u2013 like we had a really catastrophic bust. \n\nAnd this has happened multiple times, like where you\u2019ve had moments of enthusiasm and then, you know the air goes out of the bubble. It\u2019s so frequent, in fact, you can go search for AI Winter and there\u2019s a Wikipedia article explaining the bust part of the cycle. \n\nAnd so, you know, the thing that I\u2019d had skepticism about for a while is like, if the problem you\u2019re trying to solve with AI is like the intellectual exercise of understanding in very precise terms the mechanism of intelligence, which is what a lot of AI had been about. It\u2019s like, okay, like we\u2019ve got this brain. It must be like this subtle symbol processing system. And, you know, just like, you know, Newton\u2019s Laws of motion and Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, like, you know, there\u2019s some, you know, mathematical beauty sitting, you know, in the neurons and axons in your brain. And, you know, like, if we just sort of think about it hard enough, like we self\u2013reflect, like we\u2019re going to find these pure, simple rules that explain how cognition works.\n\nI was super skeptical that that was going to be a thing that goes fast. You know, because the nature of scientific breakthroughs like that is, you know, it\u2019s just sort of slow. Like, you go slow and then you have a breakthrough and things, you know, change. But, you know, predicting progress is hard. \n\nAnd what happened in 2017, like particularly with transformers, is like we had a mechanism whereby things could go fast. And like, you didn\u2019t actually have to understand the fundamental nature of human cognition. You had this thing that, as you applied scale in data and compute, could emulate parts of human cognition, and the parts that it could emulate were useful enough where you could build a platform on top of it. \n\nAnd so, like that\u2019s, you know, was a pretty straightforward argument, like it just seemed blindingly obvious. And, you know, if you are a company like Microsoft that is a technology platform company, and like your job is to equip people to go solve problems with technology, like if this is going to become a platform, you must make sure that it is a great, excellent, you know, part of the overall platform that you\u2019re building. Like, you can\u2019t really have a technology platform, I think, in 2024 without having highly capable AI.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No definitely not. But certainly that wasn\u2019t clear to many people in 2017, except for people like yourself and people like Mike, who were, you know, already investing in companies even before some of the seminal papers were being written. \n\nSo as always, like I\u2019m appreciative of both of your insights because I think we\u2019ve obviously needed this, especially as Mike was pointing out, this has become only more capital intensive. And, you know, kind of that early era is it\u2019s kind of probably a generational thing where, you know, there are very few of, when I look back in history, like moments to kind of get in at that same stage, and now it\u2019s just about identifying, you know, the next big waves probably associated with these things. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and there\u2019s still, I mean, the thing I will say to everyone who\u2019s listening there, there\u2019s still like an unspeakable amount of stuff to be done. It\u2019s just, you know, like what folks ought to be thinking about right now is like, how do I go harness the power of this platform to go build amazing new things to solve the education problems and the healthcare problems and the just myriad business problems that you\u2019re going to be able to solve now that you\u2019ve got a new tool in your toolbox to go after them. \n\nSo like, that\u2019s to me, you know, the fun stuff. Like, I always enjoy, like I derive a whole bunch of satisfaction in building products for other people building products and \u2013 but \u2013 but like, at the end of the day, like building tools is kind of useless unless people use the tools to do something that matters.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: It\u2019s so true. Like, yeah for platforms to work, people have to actually use them and want to build things off of them. And I think we\u2019re lucky we\u2019re in a space right now where people are definitely doing amazing things and are going to continue to do amazing things. And people like Mike are going to continue to invest in those things, and which is great.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: For sure. \n \nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right, well, that is all the time that we have for today.
