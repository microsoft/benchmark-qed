{"episode": "EP-39 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast 2021 Year in Review", "text": "KEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we\u2019re going to get behind the tech. We\u2019ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what\u2019s happening today. Stick around.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello and welcome to a special episode of Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Christina Warren, Senior Cloud Advocate at Microsoft. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And today, we\u2019re doing our Year in Review episode, and this means that we\u2019re going to revisit a few fascinating conversations with our guests from 2021 and beyond, with topics ranging from protein design to robotics to the importance of getting more girls in STEM.\n\nYou know, Kevin, we called 2020 an \u201cunprecedented year.\u201d My words fail me when I think about summing up the events of 2021. It makes me think of our previous guest science fiction writer, Charlie Stross, who said (and I quote): \u201cThis is just trying to front-run the insanity in my fiction, and I\u2019m having great difficulty making elder gods more horrifying than what\u2019s happening from around the world today.\u201d\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Indeed, the world today is stranger than fiction.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: It really is. But for today\u2019s show, we\u2019re focusing on Behind The Tech, which produced a fantastic year of conversations. As always, we were enlightened, humbled and inspired by the incredible guests we had the honor of speaking with.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, we had a line-up of awesome guests this last year, including AI experts, bioengineers, entrepreneurs and digital influencers. We met Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman in space. We chatted with scientist Ashley Llorens about the future of AI and robotics. And we spent time with the Grammy-award winning Jacob Collier and his collaborator, Ben Bloomberg.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, and the exciting thing about this episode is that we\u2019re also going to check in with some folks from earlier years of the podcast. So, we\u2019ll revisit some bits of conversation from your interviews with them, and we\u2019ll also share some news about what they\u2019ve been up to recently.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Great. So, who\u2019s up first? \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Okay, so, first, we thought it was fitting to check in with Anders Hejlsberg because Anders was our first-ever guest on the podcast.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Anders is one of my legitimate coding heroes. He built Turbo Pascal when he was at Borland, which is this tool that inspired me as a teenager to take computer science seriously. He eventually moved over to Microsoft, where he helped the create C# programming language. And just a few months ago, he and the team released TypeScript 4.4 which offers smarter control analysis, stricter checks and speed improvements, and a bunch of other cool programming language awesomeness. \n\nHere\u2019s a snip from our conversation where we\u2019re reminiscing about the fact that Anders and his team came up with one of the first integrated development environments written in Z-80 Assembly language.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I just want to double-click on this point again. Coming up with one of the first integrated development environments that you have written in Z-80 Assembly language at that point, that\u2019s an unbelievable breakthrough.\n\nANDERS HEJLSBERG: I suppose, in retrospect, yes. I\u2019ve never really thought of it that way. But, you know, it\u2019s-\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s just incredible. It\u2019s the first. What the- \n\nANDERS HEJLSBERG: It just seemed like, heck, this is going to be so much better\nthan having to have, first, load an editor and then load (inaudible). Why not just put it all to there? I mean, I don\u2019t know. I never really- \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And especially at the time, because, I mean, again, like more framing, these are not windowed systems, can\u2019t have multiple things opened at the same time. It\u2019s super tedious to switch from one program to another. So, like, having everything in one place is just a huge productivity win.\n\nANDERS HEJLSBERG: Oh, it was, totally. The added compile, run, debug, cycle just shrunk by many orders of magnitude.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and I\u2019m embarrassed to say I\u2019ve forgotten, what was it, F9 to compile and run, or was it F5?\n\nANDERS HEJLSBERG: You know, I don\u2019t even remember what it was. I think it was F5, yeah, but- \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It was, like, miraculous.\n\nANDERS HEJLSBERG: Or maybe it was F3, but yeah, no, it was great. There were all sorts of tricks in there, like the runtime library was the first 12K of the system. And then when producing code, I\u2019d just copy the first 12K into the (XE?) we were producing. There\u2019s your runtime library, right? (Laughter.) Then generate code from there on out, and you could compile the memory and we\u2019d put the code in memory and run it, right, or the original implementation, compile to tape, to floppy tape. (Laughter.) And then you could \u2013 sorry, to tape recorder interface, right? Then you could load that machine code up because, I mean, there was only 64K of memory. I mean, it was crazy.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So, I bought a copy of Turbo Pascal 5.5 out of a catalog called Programmers Paradise. This is just sort of how you used to buy software. And so, I forked over my $200, or whatever it was. \n\nANDERS HEJLSBERG: Oh no, it wasn\u2019t even that. It was $49, like $49.95.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it was affordable because I was poor. So thank you for making cheap software. (Laughter.)\n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: That was an excerpt from Kevin\u2019s conversation with Anders Hejlsberg, computer scientist and tech fellow at Microsoft. That was Episode 1 of Behind the Tech from 2018. Gosh, that seems like a lifetime ago doesn\u2019t it?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It does indeed. And on that note, let\u2019s jump to one of this year\u2019s guests, Dr. David Baker. David is a biochemist and computational biologist who has pioneered methods to predict and design three-dimensional structures of proteins.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: That\u2019s right. Dr. Baker is the director of the Institute for Protein Design and professor of biochemistry at the University of Washington. And we spoke with him in the spring of 2021, and since then, his lab has partnered with the U.S. Agency for International Development on a $125M project to detect emerging viruses.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Here\u2019s an excerpt from my conversation with David about the work at the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, you know, maybe in terms of SARS coronavirus-2, like, can you describe\u2013 \n\nDAVID BAKER: Yeah, that\u2019s a great idea, really good suggestion. In fact, now, when I give talks, I explain protein design in the context of coronavirus. So, let me just spend a couple minutes describing what we\u2019ve been doing at the Institute with regard to coronavirus. \n\nSo, the genome sequence was determined and made available last \u2013 at the beginning of last year. So, we took that amino acid sequence and used the methods we\u2019ve been developing to predict the three-dimensional structure of the protein on the surface, the spike protein. Of course, you\u2019re right, there\u2019s higher literacy about this now than there ever was. And we knew that the spike protein bound the ACE-2 receptor on the target cells. \n\nSo, starting initially with that model, and then shifting over to the x-ray crystal structure when it was determined of the spike ACE-2 complex, the first thing that we did was to design small proteins that we predicted would fold up into such a way that they have a shape and chemical complementarity to the part of the spike protein called the receptor binding domain that binds the ACE-2. \n\nSo, these are like \u2013 I talked about sort of lock/key interactions. So, we \u2013 if you imagine the ACE-2 is the key and the RBD is the lock, so it\u2019s sort of \u2013 the spike protein goes and binds to the ACE-2. We basically made things that would compete away that interaction, that is, bind more tightly to the virus than ACE-2. \n\nAnd we were able to make compounds that bind to the virus about 1,000 times more tightly than ACE-2, and this was really cool. They were just completely made-up proteins, completely unrelated to anything that had been seen before. And with our collaborators, we were able to actually determine experimentally how these small proteins bind to the spike, and they bound basically exactly like in our computer model. So, we could then go \u2013 that meant we could go from, essentially from the sequence of a virus to these very, very tight, high-affinity binding proteins. \n\nAnd the next thing we showed was that those proteins blocked the virus from getting into cells. And then we showed with collaborators that they protect animals from infection by the virus. And I think this was \u2013 this was kind of a real ah-ha moment for me, because we\u2019d been developing these methods for designing proteins over the years, and here, in the midst of a pandemic, we were actually able to apply them to make therapeutic candidates. \n\nAnd those are \u2013 those are now headed for clinical trials. It\u2019s been slow, because this is a completely new modality, this whole idea of computational designed proteins. So, there\u2019s been a little bit of a pushback because these are completely new things. No one knows exactly how they\u2019ll behave. \n\nBut for the next pandemic, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re going to be ready, so we have all the methods worked out and I think we\u2019ve gotten over a lot of the sociological issues to actually using these as drugs. And there\u2019s nothing really that can be as fast, if you can go from amino acid sequence to actually computing a protein which fits perfectly against the virus. So, that\u2019s the first thing we did. \n\nThe second thing we did was to design, again, completely from scratch little molecular devices that emit light \u2013 luminesce \u2013 when they encounter the virus, and those are pretty neat. We\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re developing those now for, not only for detecting the virus, but also for monitoring responses to vaccination, like, how good are my antibodies against the virus? And so, rather than that being just like a fixed key that fits into a lock, that\u2019s actually a device that can undergo changes in its state when it encounters the virus. \n\nAnd the third area, my colleague Neil King at the Institute has been developing sort of a next generation of coronavirus vaccines, using designed protein nanomaterials that we\u2019ve created at the Institute, which self-assemble into big things that look like Death Stars. And we can put the parts of the coronavirus spike on the surface. And when Neil does that, he finds it gets very, very strong immune responses, stronger than with the current vaccines. These designed nanoparticle vaccines are now in clinical trials. \n\nSo, that sort of illustrates some of the key areas in protein design now, being able to design very precise shapes that can block, that can bind very tightly to targets, being able to design molecular devices that can undergo \u2013 that can basically do logic calculations, and being able to design nanomaterials like these protein Death Stars.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: That was from Kevin\u2019s conversation with Dr. David Baker from the spring of 2021. So unbelievably cool, the Death Star protein.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So awesome. (Laughter.)\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Okay, well now we\u2019re going to jump back to the summer of 2020 and our conversation with Dr. Fei-Fei Li. \n\nDr. Li co-leads Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University. And this past October, the Institute awarded $2 million in seed grants to 26 research teams with the focus on bias, diversity, healthcare, and cognitive science.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it\u2019s super inspiring. The grantees are conducting research in things like Civics Education for a just and sustainable future and Ultra-Fast MRI For Precision Radiotherapy. It\u2019s just incredible work.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: It really is. Not only has Fei-Fei\u2019s own research been ground-breaking, but her work as an educator is remarkable. In 2015, she cofounded a non-profit called AI4ALL, and that\u2019s dedicated to nurturing new AI leaders. I just love their mission statement, which is, \u201cOur vision for AI is a world where diverse perspectives, voices and experiences unlock AI\u2019s potential to benefit humanity.\u201d\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Here\u2019s an excerpt from my conversation with Fei-Fei.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nFEI-FEI LI: And also, just talking about the rural America, this is something I feel passionate about, and I have a story to share with you.  \n\nSo, you probably know that I co-founded and chair this nonprofit educational organization called AI4ALL, right? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nFEI-FEI LI: It started as a summer camp at Stanford about five years ago to encourage diversity students to get involved in AI, especially through human-centered AI, studying and research experience to encourage them to stay in the field. And then our goal is in ten years, we would change the workforce composition. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nFEI-FEI LI: Now, it became a national nonprofit and seed granted by Melinda Gates and Jen-Hsun Huang Foundation and \u2013 \n\n KEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s awesome, I didn\u2019t know Jen-Hsun was involved. That\u2019s great. \n\nFEI-FEI LI: Yeah. It\u2019s Jen-Hsun & Lori Huang Foundation. And this year, we\u2019re on 11 campuses nationwide. One of the populations we put a lot of focus on, in addition to gender, race, income, is geographic diversity and serving rural community. For example, our CMU campus is serving rural community in Pennsylvania. We also have Arizona campus. \n\nOne story actually came out of our Stanford camp is Stephanie. Stephanie is still a high school junior now, and she grew up in the backdrop of strawberry field in rural California in a trailer park with a Mexican mom. And she come from that extremely rural community, but she\u2019s such a talented student and has this knack and interest for computer science. And she came to our AI4ALL program at Stanford two years ago. \n\nAnd after learning some basics about AI, one thing she really was inspired is she realized this technology is not a cold-blooded, just bunch of code. It really can help people. So, she went back to her rural community and start thinking about what she can do using AI to help. And one of the things she came up with is water quality. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes. \n\nFEI-FEI LI: Really matters to her community. And so, she started to use machine learning techniques to look at water quality through water samples. \n\nAnd that\u2019s just such a beautiful example. I just love her story to show that when we democratize this technology to the communities, the diverse communities, especially these communities that technology hasn\u2019t reached enough in, the young people, the leaders and the citizens of this community will come up with such an innovative and relevant ideas and solutions to help those communities. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and \u2013 and I think that getting this technology democratized is sort of a one-two punch. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: So in this conversation Kevin had about Fei-Fei\u2019s earlier work on ImageNet, ImageNet consisted of 15 million images which were organized in everyday English language of 22,000 vocabularies, mostly nouns. And it was, at that time, in 2009, the largest database of natural object images in the world. And it really was, in Fei-Fei\u2019s words, the \u201conset of the deep learning revolution.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Kevin\u2019s conversation with Fei-Fei about the continuation of that work.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Tell me a little bit more about this work that you\u2019re doing that sort of blends vision and language together, because that \u2013 that seems really quite exciting. \n\nFEI-FEI LI: Yeah. So, it actually is a continuation or step forward from ImageNet. If you look at what ImageNet is, for every picture, we give one label of an object. Fine, that\u2019s cool. You have 15 million of them. It becomes a large dataset to drive object recognition, but it\u2019s such an impoverished representation of the visual world. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Right. Yes. \n\nFEI-FEI LI: So, the next step forward is, obviously, to look at multiple objects and, you know, be able to recognize more. But what\u2019s even more fascinating to me is not the list of 10 or 20 objects in a thing, it\u2019s really the story. \n\nAnd so, right after the bunch of work we have done with ImageNet around 2014 when deep learning was, you know, showing its power, my students and I started to work on what we call image storytelling or captioning. And we show you a picture, you say that two people are sitting in a room having a conversation. That\u2019s the storytelling. And that is a sentence or two, right? \n\nAnd, honestly, I\u2019ll tell you, Kevin, when I was in grad school in early 2000, I thought I wouldn\u2019t see that happen in my lifetime because it\u2019s such an unbelievable capability humans have to connect visual intelligence with language, with that. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Right.\n\nFEI-FEI LI: But in early 2015, my group and my students and I published the first work that shows computers having the capability of seeing a picture and generate a sentence that describe the thing, and that\u2019s the storytelling work. And we used, obviously, a lot of deep learning algorithm, especially on the language side, we used recurrent models, like LSTM, to train the language model, whereas on the image side, we used convolutional neural network representation. But stitching those together and seeing the effect was really quite a \u201cwow-wee\u201d moment. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Right.\n\nFEI-FEI LI: I couldn\u2019t not believe that I saw that in my lifetime, that capability. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I sort of wonder, like, whether or not these big, unsupervised language models right now, these transformer things that people are building, the models that come out of them, like, have such -- they\u2019re just very large and, like, there\u2019s not much. You sort of barely have, like, any signal in the parameters at all. It\u2019s, like, just diffuse across the entire model. I just wonder, like, whether getting, like a vision model coordinated with training these things is going to be the way that, like, they more concisely learn. \n\nFEI-FEI LI: Oh, I see. Well, yeah, I mean, human intelligence is very multi-modal. So, multi-modality is definitely not only complementary, but sometimes is more efficient.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nFEI-FEI LI:  We should also just recognize that, by and large, these storytelling models are still fitting patterns. They lack the kind of comprehension, and abstraction and deep understanding that humans have. They can say, two people are sitting in a room having a conversation, but they lack the common-sense knowledge of the social interactions or, you know, why are we having eye contact, or whatever, right? So, there is a lot more deeper things going on that we don\u2019t know how to do yet. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: That was Stanford researcher Dr. Fei-Fei Li talking about her organization AI4ALL. \n\nNow let\u2019s continue our conversation about AI with Sam Altman, who joined the show two years ago. Sam is the CEO of OpenAI and former president of Y Combinator.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, Y Combinator is one of the most successful, if not the most successful startup incubators in existence. And OpenAI is a really interesting model. It\u2019s an AI research and deployment company with a mission of ensuring that AGI (artificial general intelligence) is safe and benefits all of humanity.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And the recent news about OpenAI is that Microsoft announced in early November of 2021 the launch of the Azure OpenAI Service, which makes\u00a0OpenAI\u2019s machine learning models\u00a0available on the Azure platform. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, this is really exciting, because these models, like OpenAI\u2019s GPT3, are incredibly difficult to train. So, having them behind an API, available on a cloud like Azure really helps democratize the power of those models, and gets it into the hands of people who can do the really interesting things with the models that the world needs them to do.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Let\u2019s listen to Kevin\u2019s chat with Sam Altman.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And like, one of the interesting things that\u2019s happening right now with these, you know, computers that we\u2019re building to train very big models is that we are \u2013 like, computer architecture\u2019s all of a sudden interesting again, and it hasn\u2019t been for, you know, 20 years, maybe, 15, like a while.\n\nSAM ALTMAN: Yeah. Yeah, that\u2019s cool because there\u2019s all these people that really want to work on that. They\u2019ve had nothing to work on, which means we can get incredible talent focused on this.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Yeah, we\u2019ve got all of these people who did high performance computing in the \u201890s who, you know, and like I \u2013 I was not an important person working on high performance computing in the \u201890s, but like, I was a compiler person. And like, I thought that none of the stuff that I learned in graduate school was ever going to be directly useful again. And like, here it is.\n\nSAM ALTMAN: Here we are. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s cool.\n\nSAM ALTMAN:  It\u2019s really cool.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It is really cool, and just a reminder of, like, how cyclical not just technology is, but history. I mean, like I don\u2019t \u2013 how much do you think about, like, the historical corollaries for the disruption that we\u2019re going through, like Industrial Revolution? You know, like, I think the steam engine\u2019s a really fascinating example.\n\nSAM ALTMAN: That\u2019s a great one.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, do you have any others that \u2013 because I know you\u2019ve thought a lot about this?\n\nSAM ALTMAN: Yeah. I mean, I think the analogs are the Agriculture Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, the Computer Revolution, and I think the AI revolution will be bigger than any of those three, bigger than all three of them together. \n\nI love reading sort of firsthand accounts of people at the time as they were kind of going through those. There\u2019s this great book called Pandemonium which is \u2013 it\u2019s all primary source material of the Industrial Revolution as it was arriving. And many of the things that people say in that book could be said now about how people feel about AI. There\u2019s no jobs; it\u2019s going to take over; the machines are going to kill us; like, the future is going to be terrible; or like, it\u2019s going to be utopia. It\u2019s like, this is so amazing. Like, there\u2019s nothing these machines can\u2019t do. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And the reality was some complicated thing in the middle.\n\nSAM ALTMAN: And we always figure out something new to do. Like, the rate of \u2013 for instance, so one of the common themes in that book was, like, what are we all going to work on. The rate of job turnover is something like 50 percent of the jobs every 75 years, and this held remarkably constant. You know, it has, like, fits and spurts, but that\u2019s held constant for hundreds of years. And like, we go -- like, technology changes. Whole classes of jobs go away, and we find new ones. And they\u2019re difficult to predict what they\u2019re going to be, but like, I think the jobs this time will change a lot, but we\u2019re going to find things to do, I\u2019m pretty sure. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So, what is the most exciting thing that you think is going to happen in AI over the next few years that you can talk about?\n\nSAM ALTMAN: Well, I\u2019ll give a few, because I think the interesting thing is the breadth of things that are going to happen. I think we\u2019ll have language models where we can interact with computers with natural language in an amazing way that we just \u2013 that feels unimaginable, and that\u2019s going to feel like intelligence. I think we\u2019ll have robots that can do human dexterity levels of manipulation, and that\u2019s going to be a huge impact on the world. I think computer games are going to get really good and fun to play. That\u2019s a sort of small sample.  \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So, it\u2019s exciting.\n\nSAM ALTMAN: Totally. It\u2019s amazing.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And, you know, none of those things \u2013 and so, this is \u2013 this is sort of to my point, like, none of those things is like Commander Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation walking around, and still, useful stuff will happen. \n\nSAM ALTMAN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, that\u2019s the thing that makes me, like, super, super excited.\n\nSAM ALTMAN: Totally. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And if we get Commander Data, like, I\u2019m excited about that, as well.\n\nSAM ALTMAN: Might happen. (Laughter.) Probably not in the next couple years, but at some point.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter.) Probably not.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\n \nCHRISTINA WARREN: That was the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman. Next up, Dr. Mae Jemison.\n\nDr. Jemison is a doctor, an engineer, a professor, a philanthropist, an entrepreneur, a writer, a dancer, and a NASA astronaut. She was the first African-American woman in space. Her list of accomplishments is long, and we encourage you to listen to her podcast. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes, she\u2019s had an intimidatingly remarkable career. As an undergrad at Stanford, she majored in chemical engineering. She concurrently took graduate-level classes in biomedical instrumentation. And she also ended up majoring in African and African-American studies. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right, and she also danced all the way through college. And so, Kevin, you asked her about this diversity of passions and academic pursuits, and how important it was to her, as a scientist, to draw upon this breadth of experience. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and she said it has been incredibly important, especially in helping her form her vision for the 100 Year Starship, which is an initiative to ensure human capability for travel beyond our solar system within the next 100 years.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s Dr. Mae Jemison talking about interstellar human travel.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nMAE JEMISON: What we do, what we see, even what we research and the questions that we ask, are based upon who we are and our experiences, right, what we\u2019ve seen, what we\u2019ve observed. So, coming back to some of the projects that I work on now, even 100 Year Starship, the title of the proposal that won this DARPA geek prize of the year, right, it was \u201cAn Inclusive Audacious Journey Transforms Life Here on Earth & Beyond.\u201d \n\nAnd that first word, inclusion, I doubt that it would have been there, if I was not the one leading the project, but the inclusion was not only across ethnicity, gender and geography. It was across disciplines, because you cannot solve a problem, like human interstellar flight, you cannot even start to approach it, without taking into account the full breadth and scope of human experiences. \n\nSo, 100 Year Starship is about making sure the capabilities for human interstellar flight exists within the next 100 years \u2013 capabilities, not building a starship or launching a starship, but having the capabilities. And the reason for that was the challenge that it requires, right, the radical leaps in knowledge that are required. We can\u2019t ease up on this. \n\nWhy is that different than going to Mars? We\u2019ve been to Mars a bunch of times, right? (Laughter.) There are some engineering challenges there, some life science challenges, but we can actually create a technology roadmap to get there.\n\nI\u2019m a little irritated I wasn\u2019t on Mars, right? (Laughter.) That\u2019s what I assumed when I was a little kid, growing up, right? At least I\u2019d be on the moon. They\u2019d just announced, you know, potential Artemis crew members, right, are going back to the moon for NASA. I\u2019m trying to figure out how I missed the original one, and how I missed the other, 50 years later. \n\nInterstellar is so different because of the vast distances, because of the enormous amounts of energy, for example, that you\u2019d have to generate, in order to across those distances in any reasonable amount of time; the autonomy that has to be developed, within a vehicle, within a system, what we have to know about the life systems, you know, from them microbiomes that help us to digest our food to the microbiome in the soil that help plants grow, all of these kinds of things need to happen, even what makes us human, right? \n\nSo, people can come up with all these other things, or why is it important for humans to go, what do we learn by place, by physically being there, but even before you go, right, let\u2019s not even think about that. How do you develop a public commitment and the will to support something like this? How do you develop the behavioral characteristics that are really needed on a starship, because I get to actually see the behavior becoming the long pole in the tent. \n\nIt\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not going to be the tech. It\u2019s going to be when I tell you I\u2019m not going to do something after you wake me up out of suspended animation, right? (Laughter.) And I say, \u201cYay. You know, how are we going to work as a team? I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m not doing that?\u201d \n\nBut it\u2019s such a wide range of challenges, and each one of those challenges, if you think about it, and \u2013 and I did not go through all of them at all, but, you know, just think of the energy, how much energy, you know? So, we can\u2019t do it through regular chemical propulsion. There\u2019s not enough chemical propulsion in the solar system to get us there. We\u2019ll have to do fission, fusion, antimatter. \n\nWe\u2019re okay with fission, but we really don\u2019t contain and control it really well, right? Fusion, we go back and forth with whether we can do fusion, right? And antimatter, we don\u2019t know how to contain antimatter, but each one of them is an order of magnitude greater energy resource, but imagine what that would do to our world, if we learned how to generate control and store that kind of energy, how it would impact us. The same thing with understanding the microbiome, the same thing with understanding investing financially in something like this, what is the return on investment? \n\nSo, when I look at all of this, and human behavior \u2013 don\u2019t, let me not leave out human behavior, right? When I look at all of this, these are really the challenges that we face in the world today, in our world, on this planet. And if we don\u2019t solve those, we have a problem. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: That was Kevin\u2019s interview with Dr. Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman in space. Now, let\u2019s hear from a recent guest who also had a fascinating career path. \n\nAshley Llorens is a scientist, engineer, and hip-hop artist known as SoulStice. Ashley talks about his immersion in growing up in the south side of Chicago, and how a boom box with two tape decks served as his first recording studio. And those early efforts led Ashley to a career in the music industry, touring through Europe and Japan. And one of his songs was featured in the Oscar-Nominated film, The Blind Side.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and simultaneously, Ashley pursued his career as a scientist. He enjoyed a 20-year career in research and development of AI technologies at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and recently joined Microsoft as a vice president, distinguished scientist, and managing director for Microsoft Research.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Here\u2019s an excerpt of Kevin\u2019s conversation with Ashley about the narratives surrounding artificial intelligence.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: The narrative is really important because it\u2019s such an important technology, and \u2013 and it is having such a profound impact on what the future is looking like every day as it unfolds, that people need to be able to understand how to engage with it to sort of, like, what do I think about this technology? What do I think about policy about this technology? What do I think about, you know, like, my hopes and my fears for the future of this technology? So how \u2013 you know, have you thought much about, like, you know, the story of AI? \n\nASHLEY LLORENS: Yeah, absolutely. And maybe there\u2019s a couple of sides \u2013 well, there\u2019s many sides, but maybe two sides I\u2019ll pick to explore there. One is absolutely the idea that AI is \u2013 is taking us in a bold new direction as a society. And I think it\u2019s more important than ever that we can engage around these policy questions and really around the directions of AI, definitely outside of computer science and across disciplines. \n\nAnd so, we do need to create narratives. Even more than that, I think we need to create directions that we agree on that we want to take this technology. \n\nA lot of times, I think people are discussing AI as something separate from human beings and human intelligence, and I think we need to be thinking of these two things as complementary. \n\nSo, what are our goals for these things? You know, can we start to set some audacious goals around enabling as many people as possible on the planet to live a long, healthy life, creating an atmosphere of shared prosperity? And what is the role of AI in doing that? To me, these big societal narratives should be at the top level of abstraction in terms of what we\u2019re talking about, and then everything else is derived from that. \n\nI think when we \u2013 if we\u2019re going to just let a thousand flowers bloom and see where we land on this thing, I think we could wind up with some really unintended consequences, you know, from that. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I really, really agree. And I think, you know, too, if you have the wrong narrative, you could have unintended consequences as well. Like, one of the things that I have been telling people over and over again over the past handful of years, as just sort of a useful device about thinking about the future of AI, is that AI, like especially its embodiment in machine learning, is a tool. And just like any other tool that people have invented, like, it\u2019s a human-made thing and, like, humans use it to accomplish a whole wide variety of tasks. \n\nAnd, you know, the tool is going to be as good or as bad as the uses to which we put it. And, you know, it\u2019s just very, very important, I think, for us to, like, have a set of hopeful things that we\u2019re thinking about for, you know, those uses of AI as, you know, we have our anxieties. \n\nAnd both are important. Like, you have to \u2013 you know, it will certainly be used for bad things. But, you know, as with any technology, like, the hope is that there will be orders of magnitude more positive things and good things that people will attempt to do with it than the bad. And part of how we get to that balance of good versus bad is the stories that we\u2019re telling ourselves right now about what it\u2019s capable of and, like, what to be wary about. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS: I think \u2013 I think that\u2019s right on point. And, you know, we can even ask yourself, you know, what does it mean to behave intelligently as a species? I actually think we\u2019re getting to the point where we can start asking ourselves and holding ourselves to, you know, to some standard there. \n\nYou know, if you just think about artificial intelligence at a low level, you know, from an agent standpoint, you know, I think intelligence, itself, is the ability to achieve goals, to set and achieve goals. And then what do you have to do? You have to be able to have some understanding of the world around you, you know, through some mechanisms of perception, whether that\u2019s kind of our human modalities or other kinds of modalities. You have to decide on a course of action, you know, that best achieves your goals. And then you have to carry it out. Like, these are the things you do to be intelligent. \n\nSo, when you extrapolate that to us, as a species, because one of the hallmarks of human intelligence is our social intelligence, our ability to you know to collectively set \u2013 pursue goals and things like that. So, I think \u2013 \n\nI\u2019m sort of \u2013 as you can see, I\u2019m sort of cursed now to see everything through the lens of intelligence and, you know, artificial intelligence. This is just how I \u2013 my lens on the world, but I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s helpful. I think it\u2019s useful. I think in order to behave intelligently as a species, we have to do some of these things that you\u2019re talking about, setting some bold visions and directions and figuring out how to organize around those. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: That was distinguished scientist and managing director for Microsoft Research, Ashley Llorens.\n\nWe have another story about the intersection of music and computer science. Earlier this year, we had the pleasure of meeting Kimberly Bryant, the founder and CEO of Black Girls Code, an organization that\u2019s dedicated to promoting equal representation of black women and girls in the tech sector.\n\nThis October, in celebration of the \u201cInternational Day of the Girl,\u201d Black Girls Code announced their partnership with actress, singer and influencer Willow Smith to help amplify their message about the importance of getting girls into STEM. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: We talk a lot about the need to bring diverse voices and perspectives to build not only better technology, but a better democracy. Kimberly\u2019s work is helping to do this by creating education and mentorship opportunities in areas like AI, robotics, virtual reality, gaming and blockchain.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Here\u2019s an excerpt from Kevin\u2019s conversation with Kimberly.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: You all are doing such great work. Like, I wonder, you know, if you could get the world to do anything that would, you know, get more women and more women of color into computing, like, what would that thing be? And, like, how can we all help support that? \n\nKIMBERLY BRYANT: I think we need more organizational support, not just at Black Girls Code, but any organization that\u2019s doing this work as a nonprofit. We can\u2019t do it alone. So, for me, it\u2019s always about how can we have this magnified effort of different organizations that are all working collectively to elevate girls in the STEM fields, particularly in computer science? \n\nAnd so, that means, like, getting companies to volunteer to help support this. So, that means bringing in staff. Our classes are run by volunteers that work in the industry. So, getting folks to volunteer at organizations like Black Girls Code, getting individuals to both give as well as encourage their organizations and companies to give to support organizations like Black Girls Code, absolutely, positively, creating both mentorship and internship opportunities. \n\nThose opportunities are transformational because it\u2019s difficult to understand what \u2013 and computer science does, if you haven\u2019t done it. Like, very \u2013 I see this from my daughter. Like, when she\u2019s in school, like, that\u2019s totally different than when she\u2019s in, you know, her internship and she\u2019s on a team of engineers that are working on a product line, totally different experience and totally different way for her to develop this \u2013 this mindset of what a computer scientist really is and what that does. \n\nAnd then I think really making sure that, once these girls are career ready, they\u2019re graduating, that they can get a foot in the door, they can get an opportunity to work with a company like Microsoft and others, and have a fruitful career there, so, pushing on all those various levels, either via individuals that are just giving of their time and resources or really holding our companies accountable for providing these opportunities to get more women in the field. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it\u2019s such a good and necessary push and, like, we should all be very, very grateful we have your leadership and your organization\u2019s leadership out there, helping us all make progress on this. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: That was the founder and CEO of Black Girls Code, Kimberly Bryant.\n\nNow, let\u2019s turn to another intersection of music and tech, this time with Grammy-award winning musician, Jacob Collier, and his collaborator, Ben Bloomberg.\n\nBen is a creative technologist who designs and builds everything from electroacoustic musical instruments to AI-driven performances and tours. Actually, we should call him Dr. Bloomberg, since he\u2019s recently earned a PhD from MIT. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That is such an accomplishment. And Jacob Collier is a multi-Grammy Award-winning instrumentalist, songwriter, arranger and producer based in London. Since we last spoke with Jacob, he\u2019s added more Grammy awards for a total of 7 nominations and 5 wins. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Incredible. And since then, he\u2019s been doing live performances with the likes of Coldplay, recording in Nashville for Jesse Volume 4, and selling out in venues in Europe and North America for his D-Jesse Work Tour 2022.\n\nI just saw a post of Jacob with Joni Mitchell. So, he got to hang out with her for what he called a \u201craucous evening of magic and music.\u201d He said it was like being in the presence of Shakespeare.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, me too. It\u2019s just so awesome. And as for Ben, I had the opportunity to work with Ben Bloomberg on the Build Conference this year, Microsoft\u2019s annual developers conference. He helped conference goers better understand how he\u2019s using tech in his musical production work.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Well, I\u2019m excited to revisit your conversation with Ben and Jacob. It\u2019s such a great conversation, and in fact, that we had to break it into two episodes. You talked about this technology that Ben designed and created called \u201cthe Harmoniser\u201d which allows Jacob to do these one-man live shows. \n\nHere\u2019s Kevin, Jacob and Ben talking about the impact of technological reliability and fallibility as it relates to the creative and performative endeavors.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: You know, what I\u2019ve done over the years with technology, like, you\u2019re sort of building things, and you\u2019ve got billions of people who use it. And so, like, you\u2019re constantly worried about the fragility of things, and robustness, and fault tolerance and reliability, and whatnot, because, you know, the consequences of something failing are \u2013 like, you just impact a lot of people. \n\nFor you all, it seems to me that, you know, one of the special things about what you do with music is that, you know, done well, like, you are completely capturing someone in this immersive emotional state, and, like, mistakes, you know, like a cough, or, like, there are very easy ways to sort of pull you out of that immersion. And so, like in that sense, like, the stuff really has to be robust, right?\n\nJACOB COLLIER: I think it\u2019s a mixture of things being robust, and then leaving space for being spontaneous, you know. And I think that this is \u2013 this is something that I\u2019m kind of forever indebted to Ben doing, was on that first Skype conversation, and in those kind of initial dreaming phases of the one-man show and the Harmoniser, and also other things, there was never a moment where it was kind of like, oh, no, no, that\u2019s too \u2013 we can\u2019t do that, that\u2019s going to be too fragile, or that\u2019s not going to work out, or that\u2019s not reasonable for you to be expecting \u2013 you know, whatever. It was like, well, if it\u2019s not possible, then we\u2019ll find a way to make it possible. \n\nAnd then I came to trust that process, not necessarily to end up where I was expecting it to, but, you know, there are a few different examples of things where we\u2019d set out thinking, I want to be able to do this live, and then by the time we do it live it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s changed its nature. \n\nI mean, I remember when we started with the one-man show, having about 10 different foot pedals across the whole stage. And I had to run around, hitting all the pedals as I would play each instrument, and then spring away from that instrument, but I figured out \u2013 well, what we figured out in trials was that if I hit that pedal even a fraction of a second after the downbeat, it would loop the following bar, you know. And so, there\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s only so much processing that my mind can do in one go about when I hit a button, and also how there\u2019s also only so much I can do physically with my body on stage, at one moment, and still be a human, and musical and give energy to a room. \n\nAnd so, you know, that\u2019s something that we \u2013 you know, we kind of looked at each other and said, \u201cYou know what, maybe we should just lose the pedals, and let\u2019s have the loopers loop invisibly, and let\u2019s just tell them when to start and stop looping.\u201d And then I \u2013 my job would be to land, just to land in front of them at the right moment in the song, play them for the right length of time, and call that in my head, and run away and keep playing.\n\nAnd so, you know, things \u2013 things do change, but I think that the thing about Ben is that there is always space for an idea to kind of be impossible for a little bit, because there\u2019s a very important fragile moment when an idea is being had, where you can\u2019t stamp on it and be too realistic. You have to dream. You have to say, this \u2013 no one could ever do this. Okay, let\u2019s go and do it, you know.\n\nAnd then, obviously, once you get started, that\u2019s when kind of my wealth of experience of being guiding by what\u2019s my idea of good and bad as creatively steps in, and Ben\u2019s massive wealth of experience about how things work the best, and what things work well, and what is a no-no, and what is a yes, those kind of come into fruition, you know, but there\u2019s that, that lovely \u2013 there\u2019s that lovely moment at the beginning where you just think, whoa, yeah, we could do this.\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG: We can do it, let\u2019s go for it. (Laughter.)\n\nJACOB COLLIER: Yeah, let\u2019s go for it. I\u2019m curious, Kevin, actually, to ask you, as somebody who has so successfully sort of had ideas and implemented them, how do you have ideas, and how do you assemble people around you to help those ideas come to life, where the idea can be as sort of safe, but yet impossible, as it needs to be to be a good idea?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think it\u2019s really, really \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s sort of the hardest thing about creativity, right, especially \u2013 I don\u2019t know. Like, I \u2013 so, with engineers, I think there\u2019s this mindset thing that maybe you\u2019re even born with where you sort of look at the world in terms of, like, all of the things that are wrong. So, you\u2019re just sort of constantly scanning things. It\u2019s like, oh, this doesn\u2019t work as well as it could, and, you know, like, this is broken and, like, needs to be fixed, which is both a good and a bad thing. It\u2019s like a slightly jaundiced world view, but it\u2019s also the thing that results in, like, you know, this determination and drive to go, like, make things better. \n\nAnd I think there\u2019s this moment when you get a bunch of technical people in the \u2013 or creative people in the room, and they come to a problem with this \u2013 they\u2019ve got this set of tools that they have, like they have an understanding of, like, how the world works, which is just that understanding at a point in time, and they have \u2013 you know, and they have their experiences about what they\u2019ve, you know, tried in the past and, like, which things have worked and which haven\u2019t. \n\nAnd like, it\u2019s \u2013 its\u2019 sort of hard at the beginning, I think, to overcome everyone\u2019s past, so, because, you know, you\u2019ll have a lot of people in the room who are like, oh, you can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s going to be too hard. That\u2019s impossible. Like, I don\u2019t know how to do that. And the thing that you have to do is figure out inside of those groups how you can \u2013 how you can give people the permission to, like, speak the daring, crazy thing and \u2013 and not immediately get shot down, where they feel safe. It\u2019s like, oh, no, you just don\u2019t want to tell people, oh, that idea is stupid. \n\nSo, like, part of it is about, you know, language and culture. Like, one of the ways that we \u2013 we really admire the growth mindset work out of this brilliant professor at Stanford, and, like, one of the things that we tell everyone is, we don\u2019t want to be know-it-alls, we want to be learn-it-alls. \n\nAnd so, if you think about all of this stuff as, like, a learning experience, it\u2019s like you have an objective in mind, and, like, the process of, like, going towards the objective is learning how to get there, then you sort of wash away a bunch of this, you know, sort of cultural stuff that can blow ideas apart before you ever really understand whether they\u2019re going to work or not. And I\u2019m guessing that that sounds like you all sort of approach things very similarly.\n\nJACOB COLLIER: Yeah, I would say \u2013 I would definitely say so, and it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s lovely to hear you talk in those terms. When Ben and I, you know, for example, set out after doing this \u2013 this first show, which was at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. We were opening up for Herbie Hancock and Chick Correa, and there were 3,000 people who had never heard of me or anything, or \u2013 which is completely new. It was completely new for me, and for everyone. \n\nYou know, having done that gig, we \u2013 we set out on this \u2013 on this tour, you know, our first tour ever, and it\u2019s crazy. And \u2013 and the objective of that, if you \u2013 you know, if you think about it in those terms, was \u2013 was kind of unclear. You know, we wanted to have a good time and we wanted to \u2013 to play music, and \u2013 and we wanted to make people happy, but we didn\u2019t really know past that, like, what exactly we wanted it \u2013 it to be like and feel and \u2013 and represent. You know, we didn\u2019t know why we were doing it. There wasn\u2019t really a reason that we \u2013 we were doing it, other than it just felt like the right moment to do it. \n\nAnd so, Ben and I set out for a month of shows, maybe about \u2013 about 20 shows. And we had eight \u2013 eight bags, between the two of us, and that meant that we each had to carry four. (Laughter.) And so, I \u2013 I can clearly remember having a huge suitcase in my left hand, huge suitcase in my right hand, and then a great big, like, rucksack in my \u2013 on my back with all of the gear, all the computer stuff in it, and then, oh my front, the \u2013 the stick base, the \u2013 the, like, double-bass in a case that goes on a stand. And Ben was kind of equivalently bestowed.\n\nAnd we would be waddling around the \u2013 the stage, and we waddled across the whole \u2013 the whole of the U.S. and then stayed on friends\u2019 couches, and \u2013 and all sorts of things, and just feeling out what was good and what we loved the most, and then sort of building around that. And even over the course of that one tour, you know, there were lots of different things that we changed.\n\nAnd I think, for me, having been used to a very kind of quick process of manifesting something that I like in a recording environment \u2013 you know, it takes me 2.5 seconds to change my mind and \u2013 and start something fresh. On \u2013 on the road, it happens at a different speed. And I guess, Ben, I\u2019m interested to hear your thoughts on what this has been like for you and continues to be like. \n\nBut, you know, at the end of every show, I would say, \u201cRight, we need to change these six things about these six songs, and we\u2019re going to change the whole structure and remove the \u2013 let\u2019s speed this one up, change the key of this one.\u201d And \u2013 and Ben was really good at kind of, from my perspective, of letting me do that kind of processing, but also grounding me in the idea that we were building a show that had to run every night. And if we change everything about every show, every night, then you\u2019re kind of starting from scratch.\n\nAnd so, there was a real kind of mutual patience, I think, that we had to have about how that process evolved, and our \u2013 our sort of goal of working together sort of emerged slightly further, the \u2013 the more steps we put in the line, you know. But Ben, do you want \u2013 do you want to talk to that at all?\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG: You know, I \u2013 I think what\u2019s really interesting, especially sort of in the world of live performance, is generally, people are reall risk averse. And so, every venue you go to, every house crew that you work with, people are \u2013 you know, people\u2019s sort of reputations and everything is sort of dependent on how the \u2013 how the show goes. \n\nAnd so, I think what we\u2019ve evolved towards now is \u2013 is just starting the conversation, you know, every single time we go into a venue, saying, you know, look, let\u2019s try, if we can, to set aside all of our sort of preconceived notions about what a show is and how you normally use your equipment, and things like that, and \u2013 and let\u2019s, you know \u2013 and it\u2019s actually, like, in big, bold letters on the front of the rider, you know, that says, like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a normal show. Let\u2019s sort of work from base principles here.\u201d \n\nAnd so, I think that sort of mindset is \u2013 is what has really sort of pervaded and \u2013 and sort of evolved. And it took me a little bit. You know, I think \u2013 I think, Jacob, you know, you definitely stretched me a lot, because at the very beginning, it\u2019d be like, oh my God, we can\u2019t change that, you know, between the \u2013 between the shows. \n\nI remember the \u2013 actually, the very first show at Ronnie Scott\u2019s, which we actually did as a \u2013 as a rehearsal show before the big Montreux show. And it was like five minutes before the show started. And \u2013 and Jacob, you came up to me and said, \u201cWe need to change the playback,\u201d or, \u201cWe need to change \u2013\u201d I forget exactly what it was. And I said, \u201cNo, no, we can\u2019t change the playback right now.\u201d (Laughter.)\n\nYeah, and it was \u2013 it was, like, the very first, you know \u2013 it was sort of the very first, like, sort of moment where we sort of had to say, okay, like, you know, we \u2013 we could change it, but every time we change something, there\u2019s been a problem. And \u2013 and maybe we\u2019ll get good at changing things down the road, you know, and really flexible, but so far, every time we\u2019ve changed something, there\u2019s been, like, a little hiccup. So, we could change it, but there might be a little hiccup. We just \u2013 we just don\u2019t know, and we can\u2019t test. So, like, what should we do, you know?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, what I\u2019ve always tried to do with the technology products that my teams and I have built is you\u2019ve sort of got these two things. One is, like, the \u2013 the faster and higher quality you can gather feedback, the quicker you can learn and the better you can make the thing that you\u2019re trying to produce. And so, engineering your environment in a way where you can get that high-quality feedback as quickly as possible is, like, super important. So, like that\u2019s one thing. \n\nAnd then the other thing is, you know, if you are thoughtful enough, you can usually understand the sorts of risks that you need to be able to take. And then you build some systems to help you manage those risks, so that you can, like, walk right up to the edge of something, and even allow yourself to fail. \n\nLike, a thing that we have in operations is this thing called MTTR, mean time to recovery. So, with software, I mean, like, both of you know this, like, there\u2019s no way to produce bug-free software. Like, it is literally, from a theory of computation perspective it is \u2013 these are undecidable problems. Like, you can\u2019t \u2013 you can\u2019t compute a solution to them, no matter how powerful a machine you have. And so, you have to reconcile yourself to the fact that you\u2019re going to produce things that will have errors in them. \n\nAnd so, the \u2013 the question then becomes how do you catch as many errors as humanly possible before you throw something out into the world. And then, like, how, once, you know, knowing full well that things are going to get through, like how do you build your systems so that you can recover from failures quickly. And that is, for software, for products, like that\u2019s a very useful way to think about the world. Like, it just lets you move faster than you otherwise would if you are constantly being crippled by the fear that you\u2019re going to fail.\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG: (Laughter.) I think that\u2019s really important, and what\u2019s so special about Jacob is \u2013 is, you know, for all that the technology does, we really do have a lot of \u2013 we really do have a lot of wiggle room, because Jacob on stage can \u2013 can make just about anything, you know, feel amazing. And \u2013 and so, you know, there have been some pretty ridiculous sort of \u2013 I won\u2019t call them failures, but moments where things didn\u2019t quite go as expected. And if it were anybody else, it would \u2013 you know, it would have been sort of a train wreck. \n\nAnd \u2013 and Jacob is able to take, you know, even the craziest things. I think, like one time in Germany, all the loopers started speeding up and going up in pitch because one of the video operators pushed \u2013 pushed the wrong button at the wrong time. And, like, nobody else can handle that stuff, but \u2013 but Jacob can make that sound musical and, you know, keep the audience having a good time. So, I think \u2013 I think, in that respect, we were sort of really uniquely positioned to try out some pretty risk stuff. You know, he kind of makes it possible. (Laughter.)\n\nJACOB COLLIER: I guess from my \u2013 just one thing from my perspective on that would be that I think Ben and I have different kind of values, different \u2013 different experiential values of control, and when control is necessary. \n\nAnd, you know, so I know, for example, that when it comes to precision of musical information, I\u2019m quite \u2013 I\u2019m quite controlled because I \u2013 I kind of tend to know the highest resolution position for this note to be for it to mean the most in the groove, for example. And I think less about you know things like \u2013 you know is this flow \u2013 is the flowchart from the element to this element within the tech going to work every night in \u2013 in a way that means I can \u2013 that we can all have a good time?\n\nAnd I guess that means that there are elements of the tech which I\u2019m stretching, from my perspective, and absolutely the same in reverse, where, you know, Ben for example will be very, very risk aware in some scenarios, but then will also highly encourage me to jump off my own creative rails, in a musical sense, and try new stuff the whole time, you know. \n\nAnd I think if there\u2019s one thing that comes from making music in one room for 10 years and then going on the road, having never done a gig, you know, I don\u2019t tend to think about imperfections being great. You know, I tend to think about imperfections that aren\u2019t to plan being things that I will kind of want to correct and make sure that they are right. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re going to be completely in a grid-based system all the time, but it\u2019s where I want it, you know.\n\nBut one thing that I, you know, at first, was very kind of \u2013 I guess I was quite intimidated with touring, and now, I\u2019m completely in love with about touring is that it\u2019s one of the only moments of your life where you have no room to be anything other than just present. You just have to be present. And so, a lot of the mistakes and the imperfections, we\u2019ve ended up designing the whole show to let those shine even more than we used to, you know. And so, I used to think that the best gigs we did were the one-man show or the gigs where I nailed all the instruments, but it\u2019s just not true. \n\nAnd I know you were saying about an environment where you can get instantaneous feedback, I mean, for me, that\u2019s just \u2013 that\u2019s going on tour. \n\nBEN BLOOMBERG: It\u2019s touring, yeah. (Laughter.)\n\nJACOB COLLIER: And every \u2013 every night, we get a fresh round of feedback, and it doesn\u2019t matter, it doesn\u2019t really matter what the audience says to you after the show. You know, they might say, oh, that was a great show, we loved it, or it was rubbish, you know, but you tend to sense, just even standing on the stage and being you on stage, how that is going down. It was a real kind of quick learning process of people immediately responded to the moments where I wasn\u2019t impossibly perfect at something, you know, impossibly good at something, the moments where there would be space for me to be, you know, wiggle around, or something would go wrong.\n\nI can think of gigs where, you know, someone would cough, and it would loop, every time, it would loop, as part of the loop [coughing] \u2013 you know, in the percussion loop because it was really quiet and someone would yell or scream or a plane would go overhead, or whatever. That would get, that would become part of the groove of the song. And that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a fabulous challenge, musically, how do you make that make sense, but you have to be willing to look a little bit like a fool and just sort of embrace it.\n\nAnd I think, for me, one thing I\u2019ve learned really is how special it can be when everyone is kind of doing that together, you know, the audience and performer alike are both coping with the strange curveball, and alchemizing it into something that feels really, really great, you know?\n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: That was Jacob Collier and Ben Bloomberg. \n\nSo, let\u2019s end this way we end every episode of Behind the Tech, which is to ask guests what they do for fun.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, this is really one of my favorite parts of the podcast. There is Dr. Peter Lee, who confessed to his love of simulated race car driving. Kimberly Bryant is a passionate gardener. And Dr. Mae Jemison loves cooking West African cuisine. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: As for Justine Ezarik, it\u2019s marital arts, specifically, Kali and jujitsu. Here\u2019s iJustine:\n\n\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK: When I walked into that gym, it was incredibly humbling because nobody cares who you are, what you do. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re on the mat, you\u2019re there to learn, you\u2019re there to train. And it\u2019s just, for me, it kind of puts so many things into perspective, mostly because I wanted to learn everything so incredibly fast. \n\nAnd, you know, as a white belt, like, you really \u2013 like, you think, yeah, I\u2019m doing such a great job. And then somebody comes in and crushes you, and then you just go home crying. You\u2019re like, oh, man, I know nothing. (Laughter.) And it\u2019s like every single time, it\u2019s like every time you level up and you learn something, that just causes another problem. But it\u2019s just such a vast variety of things that you earn. And it\u2019s so empowering when you actually are able to start leveling up and actually learning things. And it\u2019s honestly one of the most rewarding things that I\u2019ve ever done. \n\nAnd I think I learned the most when I got injured for the first time because I was going too tough. I wanted to learn everything so fast. And that taught me to slow down and kind of enjoy the process. Like, you\u2019re not going to learn everything in this first year. So, if you keep getting hurt, you\u2019re not going to be able to progress. So, it\u2019s like that injury taught me to kind of figure out what else I could do when I couldn\u2019t be training. \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I started the other martial arts, Kali, which is more kind of, like, hand-to-hand combat with, like, various sticks and different weapons. I was doing that while I was injured. And then it\u2019s kind of \u2013 that sort of has played into my life a lot, where if there\u2019s a problem that I\u2019m having, I\u2019m like, okay, I, myself, cannot do this, but what else can I do to work around that issue to make it work? So, it\u2019s like martial arts has taught me so, so much about, like, myself, and it\u2019s just such a rewarding experience. \n\nAnd I think from that, my biggest piece of advice to anyone is, like, have a hobby that you do outside of anything. And just go, set your phone down and just be. And I mean, that took me like 13 years to kind of figure that out. (Laughter.) And, you know, when I did, I was like, this really is life changing. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: That was from Kevin\u2019s conversation with actress, author and influencer, Justine Ezarik.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, before we close, I just want to say thank you again to all our guests on Behind the Tech.
