{"episode": "EP-48 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Randall Munroe", "text": "RANDALL MUNROE: Then fell into doing comics where I can spend all day diving into some rabbit hole, and then draw comics about it. And then the next day, move on to a different thing. I found a way to grab all the candy in the candy store.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we\u2019re going to get behind the tech. We\u2019ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what\u2019s happening today. Stick around.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello, and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Christina Warren, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And today, we have a super exciting guest with us, Randall Munroe. He\u2019s famous for creating the webcomic xkcd\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 Randall is maybe my favorite cartoonist. So I very rarely post cartoons onto social media; 100% of them are Randall\u2019s stuff.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: 100%. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, once a month, once every other month, like he\u2019ll write something that I just think is so fabulously funny that I have to share it with my other nerd friends.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I mean, well \u2013 well that \u2013 well, that\u2019s what makes the comic so good is \u2013 and \u2013 and you know, I\u2019m interested to hear what you two talk about. But it\u2019s such a \u2013 it covers such a wide spectrum of \u2013 of nerd-adjacent topics. And \u2013 and because the comic\u2019s been going on so long, they\u2019re literally \u2013 it\u2019s like The Simpsons There literally is one for everything. You know, like there\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s an xkcd that you can apply to any situation.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Absolutely. And \u2013 and the thing that I\u2019m always surprised by when I share one of his comics, usually the things that I find funny are like the most arcane.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And you\u2019ll share them, and then you\u2019ll find that there\u2019s this huge audience of people who find the same arcane thing \u2013\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 amusing, which is so awesome. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, no, it really is. I mean, and I think this gets to the matter of why he\u2019s such a good comic and a good writer is that he\u2019s able to capture these things that we think are unique to us that only \u2013 only we really, you know, care about these \u2013 these small particular things and find it funny, but it\u2019s more broad than you would think, and the internet makes that possible. \n\nHe\u2019s also a great writer. I actually interviewed him, this is funny, like when the first What-If book came out about eight years ago. So \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s so awesome.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: \u2013 you know, so he does great stuff. \n\nSo let\u2019s go ahead and let\u2019s just dive into your conversation with Randall. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Randall Munroe started his career in physics working with robots at NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center. He\u2019s well known, however, for engineering a creation of a different sort, the iconic webcomic xkcd. He describes his work as a webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math and language. \n\nRandall, thank you so much for joining us today. I\u2019m a huge, huge fan of your work.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Oh, thank you. Thanks for having me.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, and there\u2019s so much stuff I want to ask you about. But like maybe we will start the same way that I start with most of our guests, which is talking a little bit about how you got interested in science and technology as a kid, or whenever that spark got lit.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 I feel like it covers such a broad area of stuff. Like I felt like as a kid, I was just interested in all kinds of different things, you know, why the creek in our backyard flowed the direction it did, and like, what atoms were made of, and cool Square One\u2019s TV show Mathnet for kids was a big influence. \n\nYou know, and then \u2013 and then as I got older, it\u2019s sort of like, oh, a lot of these things fit together under the umbrella of science or math. And that sort of gave me more \u2013 more direction. But \u2013 but I still felt like I was sort of jumping from exciting thing to exciting thing, and I didn\u2019t think of them as really fitting into one coherent whole.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And \u2013 and did your parents do anything special to encourage that curiosity that you had when you were young?\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yeah, I mean, my \u2013 both my parents, I don\u2019t know, I get a lot of my personality and general inclination from them, I\u2019m sure. And they \u2013 I know my dad had some engineering; he did some engineering work. And so, he was sort of \u2013 like, I remember one time, me and my brother arguing \u2013 you know, trying to figure out who could run faster. And my dad was like, \u201cWell, you know, you can figure out how fast you run by measuring.\u201d And like, he measured a section of the road, and had us run from one to the other with a stopwatch and be like, \u201cOh, now you can find out how fast you\u2019re running,\u201d you know. And it wasn\u2019t like a really athletic thing. It was more like, oh, this is a thing you can measure. That\u2019s cool. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yeah and my mom was always very interested in maps and kind of patterns and logistics, and I feel like I got a lot of that from her.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s super cool. And did you \u2013 you know, when you were a kid, either in, you know, grade school, middle school, high school, did you take a bunch of science classes? Did you \u2013 did you start making things early?\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yeah. You know, I went through some phases where I remember doing a couple of biology classes in a row, and feeling, you know, sometime in middle school, and feeling like, you know, I thought I liked science, but then, I don\u2019t know, I \u2013 it\u2019s a common thing. Like, I remember the day we were like, cutting up animals, you know, dissection. And I was like, I don\u2019t really like this, I don\u2019t want to do this, you know. \n\nAnd \u2013 and \u2013 and there were \u2013 and then \u2013 and then, you know, I had some chemistry classes, and I just was like, I\u2019m having a hard time with this and it\u2019s not that exciting. You know, maybe \u2013 maybe what I really want to do is language and, you know, math.\n\nAnd then \u2013 and then I hit \u2013 I remember a year when I asked some question, and the teacher was like, \u201cOh, I think the answer to that is in this physics book.\u201d And I was like, oh, okay, and I started flipping through. And I\u2019m like, oh, this is all the science I really like. Physics, that\u2019s what \u2013 that\u2019s what I want to do. And \u2013 and so, that got me, sort of pulled me back from language back towards science. \n\nAnd then as the years have gone by, I\u2019ve really warmed up to biology, especially is very cool. I still don\u2019t really want to cut up animals, but that\u2019s fine. There\u2019s a lot of other cool biology out there.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it is interesting, like how we all gravitate to different things. I mean, I think that the thing you said earlier, that science and technology is such a broad umbrella, there\u2019s so much in it. \n\nLike I \u2013 I think I was a lot like you. I didn\u2019t really enjoy chemistry and biology, you know, sort of the lab science sorts of things, all that much. \n\nBut like I have a 14-year-old daughter now who\u2019s just absolutely obsessed with biology and medicine. And like, so when she got to dissect a heart, it\u2019s like, \u201cOh my god, this is the most amazing thing ever. Well, like when can I dissect another one?\u201d \n\nAnd so, I \u2013 you know, I just \u2013 I mean, one of the things I appreciate about what you do is you sort of present this picture of science as this very broad thing. So you know, hopefully lots of people can find something about the way that you\u2019re portraying it that they can latch on to and find interesting.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yeah, I think \u2013 I think it\u2019s maybe less a matter of, you know, science is one of the things you can learn about, and more that, like, you can be curious about things and science is a tool for helping you to understand the things you\u2019re curious about, you know, And so, in that way, it\u2019s less of like a thing to be interested in and more a way to be interested in other things.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, that \u2013 that is beautifully put. \n\nSo did you know by the time you graduated high school that you wanted to study physics in college and be a physicist as your profession?\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: I think I was still wandering back and forth between areas between like \u2013 I mean, I felt like sort of like a lot of high school students and like, I don\u2019t really know what I want to do, what I want to \u2013 uh-uh, I just don\u2019t want to do the assignments I\u2019m assigned right now, let alone like, take on more of them in. \n\nBut um, no, I did \u2013 I did first robotics, which was a lot of fun. That was my first kind of hands on, like that kind of team, competitive, engineering-oriented activity. And that got me sort of into engineering. \n\nAnd so, I think when I was looking at \u2013 at colleges, I was looking at either engineering or physics, and ended up I went to Christopher Newport University in southeastern Virginia and got a degree in physics there. \n\nBut even then, I was sort of \u2013 I think I was pretty solidly settled in on the physics track by the time I was at least in my first or second year, but I still didn\u2019t feel like I really like knew exactly where I wanted to narrow things down to. So I took a lot of, you know, computer science classes, math classes, some other stuff. \n\nAnd then, when I graduated, and I was looking at grad school, I remember one of my \u2013 my advisor was talking to me and \u2013 and saying, you know, okay, yeah, you know, you \u2013 you seem to enjoy physics, you\u2019re doing \u2013 doing okay, at it, your grades are fine. I mean, they were \u2013 they were nice about it; my grades were okay. \n\nAnd so, the \u2013 but \u2013 but they were sort of like, if you\u2019re going to go into grad school, you really need to sort of zero in a little bit more on something specific. And \u2013 and I just didn\u2019t feel like there was any particular area of physics that grabbed me. You know, like, I liked the general language of it, I liked applying it to things, but it wasn\u2019t like I really wanted to get into, you know, particle physics or dynamic system modeling, or \u2013 or materials, or \u2013 or anything, you know, or cosmology. You know, there are all these different areas, and it was like, okay, you gotta pick something and kind of drill down into that, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to be doing in grad school for a few years is like, you know, really getting up to speed on this one area. \n\nAnd \u2013 and I said, you know, I just don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know. Maybe I just need to, like, you know, spend some more time learning, exploring, because I feel like I haven\u2019t found an area like that. But I really like doing this stuff. \n\nAnd \u2013 and I remember my advisor, at one point said, \u201cWell, listen, you can\u2019t have all the candy in the candy store. You can\u2019t just keep on jumping from one thing to another and learning a little about it, and then moving on.\u201d \n\nAnd \u2013 and I was like, \u201cOkay, I guess \u2013 I guess I\u2019ll just figure it.\u201d And so, I didn\u2019t go to grad school for the first year or so. I mean, and I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll think about it after a year,\u201d but then fell into doing comics where I can spend all day diving into some rabbit hole and then draw comics about it. And \u2013 and then the next day move on to a different thing. And so, I sort of found a way to grab all the candy in the candy store.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and \u2013 and it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s really interesting. I mean, we\u2019ll \u2013 we\u2019ll get into the xkcd in \u2013 in a minute and your whole process, but like, one of the things that I find super impressive is like you\u2019re diving deep enough into a bunch of things where the humor is sometimes like deep inside baseball. \n\nLike I remember, one you did recently was you were riffing on, like, how you could distinguish mindset of scientists, or like types of scientists by the \u2013 like, the \u2013 the Greek symbology that they \u2013 that they use, which is hilarious. Like just, I mean, like, maybe \u2013 maybe only to \u2013\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Thank you.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 a scientist. But \u2013 but you know, how \u2013 how do you \u2013 how do you approach these deep dives into so many different things? Because a lot of these things are fairly disconnected from one another. Like, you\u2019ve got a basic set of principles, but the literature is different, like they use \u2013 you know, they write math in a different way. It\u2019s almost like a different language on top of a \u2013 you know, a common language. So how do you deal with that?\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Well, I mean, I spend \u2013 I spend a lot of time reading a lot of different science stuff and trying to understand things. And often, I\u2019m just, you know, trying to understand something for my own curiosity. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to educate myself in this. But like, in the process of trying to answer some question, I\u2019ll discover I\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019ve read a whole bunch of this. And like, oh, this is where they store these papers, and this is how they present this kind of data, and this is what this weird chart means. \n\nBut the interesting thing about \u2013 about writing about this stuff is, it\u2019s almost helpful to not know as much about a field, because it\u2019s really hard to notice the things that are weird about it, when you\u2019ve been really suffused in it. \n\nAnd so, like \u2013 like, there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 a lot of the time when I encounter something for the first time, that\u2019s when it\u2019s sort of easiest to point out, \u201cOh, you know, it is kind of weird that they all do this,\u201d and like, the people who are working in the field will notice, \u201cOh, yeah, it is weird that we write that that way, isn\u2019t it?\u201d But like, they\u2019ve gotten used to it, so to them it\u2019s the normal way of doing things. \n\nAnd \u2013 and like, every field has its own quirks that you just kind of get used to, but it\u2019s sometimes easier as an outsider to \u2013 to \u2013 to notice them and \u2013 and kind of make fun of them, or like a lot of the time, when I come in, I\u2019ll be confused by something. And if you\u2019re in \u2013 if you\u2019re working in science, and in academics, and in a lot of areas of life, there\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of pressure to sound like you know what you\u2019re talking about, and to not sound clueless, to, you know, when \u2013 when something comes up that you don\u2019t understand, you\u2019re like, ah, okay, and then there\u2019s this thing, but I\u2019m not going to go into it. You know, you\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re thinking like, hopefully, they don\u2019t ask me questions about that part. I don\u2019t understand that part, you know, but I can if we need to. And there\u2019s a lot of like, sort of the insecure, like wanting to seem like an expert in something. \n\nAnd that impulse, I think, can be counterproductive in a lot of ways, but it\u2019s also counterproductive if you\u2019re trying to \u2013 to communicate about the science or \u2013 or write about \u2013 or \u2013 or, you know, make jokes about the science, because a lot of the time that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s funny is like, the \u2013 the stuff that everyone sort of understands, but is secretly a little confused by. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nRANDALL MUNROE: And so, I find sometimes embracing that and being like, okay, I\u2019m just going to admit, I\u2019ve never understood what, you know, Laplace space is or something, you know, like, both it\u2019s like an opening to other people being like, \u201cOh, yeah, you know, I was confused about that for a long time, and then I finally figured it out. Here\u2019s the \u2013 you know, here\u2019s the trick.\u201d \n\nAnd it\u2019s also a great chance to \u2013 to, like, you know, observe, this is how I feel about this. And \u2013 and that can \u2013 that can be like a good topic for \u2013 for a joke, or just any kind of like, meta \u2013 meta stuff. Like the stuff that you\u2019re confused by is like, the \u2013 the salient stuff.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, you know, I sort of feel like you\u2019ve set yourself a much harder task than, say, a science writer, like someone who\u2019s going to write popular science books, or like write science columns, you know, for the front half of Science or Nature. Because you have to be right enough, and \u2013 and the insights that you have, have to be keen enough where the joke works. Because like, the ultimate thing is like whether someone is surprised or has an \u201caha\u201d or laughs at something that you do, and there\u2019s no BS\u2019ing that, right? It \u2013 like the \u2013 the laugh either comes or it doesn\u2019t. \n\nAnd so, you know, I sort of feel like you have to have this like, pretty deep understanding that you \u2013 you may not have to have when you can, you know, throw a bunch of fuzzy language on top of a description of something that you don\u2019t really understand.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: I don\u2019t know. I \u2013 I think I have a lot of respect for the people who write the \u2013 those \u2013 those columns. Oftentimes, they\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019re, you know, really serious scientists who are \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: \u2013 who are really trying to figure out \u2013 sort of, I feel like people who write about science get it from both directions. They get criticized by the experts for being like, \u201cYou\u2019re making our stuff to \u2013 you know, you\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re dumbing it down, you\u2019re making it hard, you\u2019re missing these important points.\u201d But then, like, if you wrote it the way the scientists, that like satisfied the scientists, like no normal human would understand it. And like \u2013 and so, the normal humans are like, this is confusing. Why are you, you know, making me like follow this, like using these words, but I don\u2019t know what these words mean. This is really frustrating to read. You know, it makes me feel like, I don\u2019t understand anything. And you don\u2019t want to make the \u2013 the readers feel like that, but then like, you also are going to get yelled at by the scientists. So I don\u2019t know, I think that balancing that is about as hard as anything in \u2013 in \u2013 in, you know, writing or science \u2013 or science. \n\nBut I don\u2019t know, sometimes being able to make jokes about things is a little bit of an out, you know. It\u2019s \u2013 because \u2013 because I can make a joke about not understanding a Fourier transform, and that\u2019s actually easier than \u2013 than understanding the Fourier transform. \n\nAnd so, you know, it\u2019s like, when I understand something, when I\u2019ve figured something out, I can draw on that. But then, like, I can stop at the point where I don\u2019t understand things anymore. \n\nAnd \u2013 and people will often kind of assume, oh, you made a joke about this area of this field; you must understand the whole field. And I\u2019m like, no, I just \u2013 just that part. That\u2019s what I wrote the joke about. \n\nSo you know, I think \u2013 I think people are \u2013 give \u2013 will give a lot of credit to \u2013 to, you know, if you make a reference to something, to assuming, oh, he must know all this stuff. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, but \u2013 but there is just sort of an honesty to the joke, right? Like there \u2013 you know, it\u2019s either funny, or it isn\u2019t.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that\u2019s definitely true. And that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s kind of a nice subjective anchor that like, if \u2013 it\u2019s like with \u2013 with any kind of science writing, it\u2019s hard to tell if you\u2019re \u2013 the people you\u2019re talking to her understanding you. And this is like true in any area of anything. Like, when you\u2019re talking to people, you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re really getting across what you think you\u2019re getting across. \n\nAnd like anyone who\u2019s lectured in \u2013 in an academic context knows, you know, how do you tell if the students are paying attention? Like, how do you tell if they\u2019re completely lost or not? Like when I would be completely lost in class, I would be like, I\u2019m just going to continue taking notes and pretending I know what\u2019s going on and hoping I pick it up soon. \n\nAnd so, joke \u2013 writing jokes is nice, because you \u2013 you can tell if people laugh or not, you know? And if \u2013 and if they aren\u2019t laughing, you\u2019re not like, well, it\u2019s okay; they understand the joke. You know, you \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: If people aren\u2019t laughing, if people don\u2019t laugh, it means your joke needs work. \n\nBut I \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I do think \u2013 I think that\u2019s, again, something that it\u2019s almost easier, like with science writing you can \u2013 you know, if you\u2019re writing an article about something as a journalist, you know, you \u2013 you \u2013 you really have to know, is my audience going to understand this or not? Because you aren\u2019t going to get the same feedback.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, and I do agree with the thing that you said a minute ago, like I do, I have a deep respect for science writers. Like I just recently wrote an essay for the Journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences on AI, and the audience is like everybody who reads the Journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which is like a pretty broad range of academic-minded folks, like not all of whom are even scientists. \n\nAnd the article was about AI. And so, I felt very self-conscious the whole time I\u2019m writing the essay about this line that you described, like, am I going to, you know, get scolded by my AI colleagues for taking liberties with details? And am I doing enough of the liberty taking to get people to actually be interested in what I\u2019m writing, so they\u2019ll read the whole thing and maybe have a little bit better understanding of the topic I\u2019m writing about? So I do think it is, I have a deep admiration for people who do that well. Like it feels very hard whenever I tried to do it.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: It is. And \u2013 and one thing I feel like you got to \u2013 that \u2013 that comes up in this is, I\u2019ve really seen, noticed there\u2019s like a gender component to how people respond to science writing. Like, I\u2019ll write about something that I barely understand, or you know, like, I\u2019ll \u2013 I\u2019ll come across some topic and be like, oh, this is a funny little tidbit in this area of math; I\u2019m going to make a joke about it, you know, or I\u2019m going to mention something about it. And people will like automatically assume, oh, he must know this whole area; you know, he must know everything about this. \n\nAnd I think that women who I know who do science writing do not get the same presumption of expertise. Like I get introduced as like Dr. Munroe a surprisingly \u2013 like a surprising amount of \u2013 with surprising frequency. \n\nAnd \u2013 and I don\u2019t really worry about titles that much, but it does grate a little bit when the number of friends I have who are women with PhDs who don\u2019t get introduced that way. And so, I always try to like, be \u2013 be clear about that. \n\nBut yeah, it\u2019s frustrating when you\u2019re trying to explain something to the public and walk that line. And like, I\u2019ll get people assuming I don\u2019t know something, you know, to some extent, but a lot of the time I get grace, you know, given kind of leeway in the other direction. \n\nWhereas, if \u2013 if you\u2019re a woman writing about science stuff, and you, you know, simplify something or refer to something, you\u2019ll get people being like, \u201cActually did you know, this is a simplification? Really, there\u2019s this more complicated thing. I can send you some books on it,\u201d or whatever? And it\u2019s like, that\u2019s something that it\u2019s a lot easier being a man writing about this stuff, and that\u2019s really frustrating. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it\u2019s super frustrating. \n\nRANDALL MUNROE: So it\u2019s like, it\u2019s nice that people assume that I know all this stuff, but I sort of wish they would assume other science writers knew it, too. So I have it easier in that way.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, that\u2019s a great viewpoint. \n\nAnd \u2013 and, you know, I think there are other interesting biases, as well. There\u2019s like a famousness bias. Like, because you\u2019re well known, like people are going to make assumptions. There\u2019s, you know, if you talk a particular way, people will assume you like are more or less well-educated or better informed. I mean, it\u2019s really dealing with all these biases. And I think you\u2019re right, like women \u2013 women certainly suffer from this far worse than many, many, many other cohorts.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Well, and it\u2019s like, just sort of that specific tradeoff of like, you know, that \u2013 that\u2019s the central tradeoff of like talking about or writing about science is like, you know, simplifying things, but making things, you know, clear and easy to understand, while not losing nuance. And it\u2019s like, you\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re balancing that thing, and it\u2019s just for some people, it\u2019s a lot easier to do that balance than others, because they have more to work \u2013 more, you know, presumption of expertise to work with.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, you know, it\u2019s sort of interesting. I mean, related to this is I was chatting \u2013 chatting with Neal Stephenson about this and like he \u2013 yeah, so \u2013 so Neal Stephenson is like famous science fiction author. I know you know who Neil is, but just sort of saying it for the \u2013 saying it for the audience. \n\nAnd \u2013 and you know, Neal also gets this sort of presumption of, because he\u2019s wrote so many books and like, been such an accurate forecaster of some future trends in these books, like he gets a huge benefit of the doubt. \n\nAnd we were talking about this thing, which is, like, there \u2013 there are people who sort of make appeals to authority, and there are people who, you know, make appeals to rationality. And so, like, you know, peer reviewed, it\u2019s not perfect, but the peer review process for scientific discovery, like you have to sort of have faith in the process, like not faith in the authority of the people submitting papers. This is why we have blind reviews in some \u2013 some journals and conference proceedings, and like, you\u2019re just trying to figure out like how you can, like, really get to the truth. \n\nAnd then there are these other places where, you know, we try to appeal to authority, where you sort of have some established reputation of the person and then like, you trust what the person is saying because of their authority, not because of the rigor of the process by which they produce an idea. \n\nAnd I do wonder, we were talking about this in the \u2013 in the case of the web, right, where you just have this, you know, with the web and social media, you have a way for anybody to say anything that they want, and it gets very confusing sometimes. You know, authority versus rationality, you know, get mashed up in all sorts of I won\u2019t say bad ways, like because I mean, like I sort of \u2013 I have a bias, right? Like, I\u2019m a scientist by training. But it\u2019s certainly different than it was 20 years ago, \n\nI wonder if you get any of this or, you know, this is part of your process with X \u2013 xkcd. Like you\u2019re trying to, you know, shine a light on truth, right. And I guess there\u2019s a way that you could do your comic where it was more about the joke than about the \u2013 the \u2013 the integrity of the science writing that you were doing. But part of what makes xkcd work so well, for me at least is that it\u2019s great because the integrity of the science writing is there, and it\u2019s funny.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Well, thank you. No, yeah, I mean, the web let\u2019s \u2013 the statement that the web lets people say an awful lot of stuff and it can get confusing, I think is maybe an understatement of the century. \n\nYeah, I think that it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s sort of, you can get bogged down in \u2013 in these kinds of theoretical frameworks about, like, you know, the right way to search for truth, in ways where I feel like a lot of \u2013 like, a lot of science works through things that if you think about them in theory, like seemed like they shouldn\u2019t work at all. And yet, like in practice, they end up producing good science. \n\nLike, you know, the \u2013 the \u2013 like, the ease with which you can fake data, or, you know, fool yourself and get something published, if you\u2019re respectable, you know, you \u2013 how easy it is, like, it \u2013 like the incentives, you know, career-wise, and \u2013 and economic in some cases, not \u2013 not as much as scientists would like, but you know, the \u2013 like, it seems like in \u2013 in \u2013 like, scientists are human. They should be susceptible to all the same \u2013 you know, all the same \u2013 the same problems. And yet, for the most part, like science seems to work in a way that I think is really that it\u2019s a bunch of people who are sort of behaving in good faith and working together. And that, I think, is like a key piece of it. \n\nSo I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s necessarily the difference between authority, like trusting an authority blindly and like going and checking things yourself. Like, if I\u2019m \u2013 if I\u2019m like, looking up, you know, some \u2013 some number or \u2013 or some measurement, like, I\u2019ll just go to a paper that has been out for a little bit, has been cited, they measured it. I\u2019m going to trust they measured it right. You know, I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m \u2013 especially if it\u2019s, you know, this is \u2013 okay, this is someone vaguely respected, this is serious work. And like, that can be wrong, sometimes, but most of the time, it won\u2019t be wrong. Most of the time, that\u2019s like, you can rely on that. And it\u2019s because, like, of a human process happening there, you know, not just the peer review itself, but like, the general trust between a bunch of people working together. \n\nI think the maybe the \u2013 the key thing that \u2013 that is behind a lot of this is not so much like bias or lack of bias, or like, you know, who you look to as an authority versus whether you trust your own experiments over what, you know, the authorities are saying, is more just curiosity that \u2013 that you can\u2019t \u2013 you can\u2019t do good science if you don\u2019t have a question that you\u2019re earnestly trying to answer. And if you\u2019re earnestly trying to answer it in good faith, then these tools, you know, of collaboration and of scientific experiment will help you get to it. \n\nAnd if enough people are not trying to answer questions in good faith and not trying to, like understand things better, then yeah, the whole thing falls apart. But I think that that is because if people aren\u2019t \u2013 if people are not trying to answer questions and \u2013 and learn in good faith, then you \u2013 no amount of bolting scientific philosophies onto that is \u2013 is going to help. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I super strongly agree with that. I think the other thing, too that you just mentioned, this notion that science is collaborative, is really an important thing. Like, one of my theories about why science ultimately, or like scientific ideas, like have to \u2013 good ones have to work is because often, you\u2019re composing them together. And so, if someone publishes something that\u2019s faulty, and then someone else picks that idea up, and uses it in a thing that they in good faith are trying to go solve, they very quickly may discover that everything sort of breaks because the thing they\u2019re relying on was broken. \n\nAnd so, you just sort of ten \u2013 like there\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s sort of peer review beyond the peer review that got things published. So like, there\u2019s just this, if it\u2019s good science, like people are going to want to use it, and so, like the scrutiny continues.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yeah. I think a lot of the \u2013 a lot of the places that we seem to run into trouble is \u2013 are where there\u2019s a thing that we all want to solve, and then there\u2019s a piece of science that like someone does something where it\u2019s like, oh, if this is true, then it\u2019s really helpful, and we can all do more with it. \n\nAnd like, so then people grab onto it, and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, great, this helps me solve a problem I have here,\u201d you know, and \u2013 and \u2013 and \u2013 and there isn\u2019t necessarily, you know, the incentive to like, you don\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t go back and double check, hey, was that right or not? \n\nAnd it\u2019s less like \u2013 it\u2019s less like, you know, a question of deceit and those people doing bad science. Maybe they were doing perfectly good science or \u2013 or \u2013 or \u2013or maybe, you know, they assigned it to a grad student who faked some data. But whichever it is, like, people are curious about another problem. Your science helps them, you know, gives them a piece of their solution that they\u2019re trying to build. And then \u2013 and then it isn\u2019t until years later that someone goes back, and is like, \u201cOh, no, this is wrong,\u201d you know.\n\nAnd \u2013 and that\u2019s where I think \u2013 that\u2019s where I think it\u2019s the most helpful to have people who are doing stuff like, you know, these replication projects, or \u2013 or just people who are kind of curious and \u2013 and \u2013 and saying, like, okay, all of this relies on this assumption. What \u2013 maybe we can get a different solution if we change this, you know. What if \u2013 what if \u2013 has anyone checked if this data is right? \n\nIt\u2019s not a process of like, trying to examine who has made a mistake and grill them and find the liars. You know, it\u2019s like, maybe we\u2019re missing something here. Let\u2019s go back and look at this, you know. \n\nLike the \u2013 the example I\u2019m thinking of right now is the recent papers on the amyloid hypothesis and Alzheimer\u2019s. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Where it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s, you know, someone \u2013 someone fakes some data to make their, you know, research look publishable and exciting. But like, it wasn\u2019t \u2013 the people who were then using that, it wasn\u2019t that they were, you know, ideologically driven, or had blinders on, you know, or weren\u2019t checking their work enough. It was like, they all were trying to figure out how to treat Alzheimer\u2019s, and they couldn\u2019t find a solution. And this was like, okay, here\u2019s a promising avenue. Like, let\u2019s try applying this to a bunch of things, you know. And \u2013 and it was already, you know, the \u2013 the story behind that work is interesting. Like, it was already work that existed because people were so \u2013 were struggling to validate this hypothesis. \n\nBut, you know, it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not like the \u2013 the incentives there were more like, people thought they had promising leads, and they weren\u2019t, you know \u2013 like, no one wants to \u2013 no one wants to have the whole basis of what they\u2019re working on be wrong. But then, like, people did eventually go \u2013 like, the \u2013 the \u2013 the hypothesis, the amyloid hypothesis is \u2013 is \u2013 really has been taking a lot of hits. It was \u2013 you know, the theories based on this didn\u2019t work. You know, the \u2013 the medicines that we\u2019ve developed didn\u2019t work. \n\nAnd, you know, if you talk to people in like the pharmaceutical field, like they say, like, yeah, this is we\u2019ve got a mess here. We\u2019ve been working on this hypothesis for, you know, all this time and it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not getting us anywhere. We don\u2019t know what to do. You know, like, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019re trying to cover that up. It\u2019s just everyone\u2019s trying to find an answer. Everyone wants to cure Alzheimer\u2019s. \n\nAnd so \u2013 so there is a place where I think that sort of mechanical like, you know, there isn\u2019t an incentive to think, well, what if I\u2019m not onto anything, after all? But if you can find an alternate hypothesis, then that\u2019s a reason to like, go poke holes in the first one, you know. I think that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s kind of I think it\u2019s like a \u2013 it\u2019s a messy, collaborative process that isn\u2019t \u2013 isn\u2019t so much about spotting deceit as like trying to recognize whether you\u2019re really getting closer to an answer or not with what you\u2019re doing.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and I think it does \u2013 in some cases, it\u2019s hard when the experiments are very expensive and when the \u2013 the experiment durations are very long.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And like there\u2019s a bunch of stuff in particle physics that are sort of that way where, I mean, like, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re trying to figure out whether or not we can make a net energy producing tokamak now. And you know, Europe\u2019s going to spend tens of billions of dollars building the Nth tokamak in the world, hoping that they can get a \u2013 you know, something that net produces energy. And it would be so valuable, you know, if we can. And like tokamaks, like the physics look like it ought to work if you can just solve all of these engineering challenges. \n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yeah, there\u2019s because a lot of interesting \u2013 yeah. \n\nYeah, it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a that\u2019s a fun one. I\u2019ve seen some \u2013 some strongly differing opinions on whether those \u2013 on how \u2013 how solvable those engineering problems are. I really \u2013 I\u2019m really \u2013 I\u2019m as interested as anyone to see what they \u2013 what they manage. But yeah, definitely not cheap.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, super not \u2013 not cheap. \n\nWell, so let\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s go back a minute to, so you\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re on this physics path, and then you sort of discover comics, which, you know, seems like a non-linearity for like physicists. They \u2013 they\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019re \u2013 I don\u2019t think there are that \u2013 that many examples of physicists who \u2013 who decide that they want to start making a webcomic. Did you doodle a lot when you were a kid?\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: You know, you might \u2013 you might be surprised about that. There\u2019s \u2013 I \u2013 at one point, I had a list of, of people with physics degrees, who took a right turn and went into cartooning. There\u2019s more of them than you think. In fact \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Interesting.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: \u2013 out of all of the people who got a physics degree, but then went on to a cartooning career, and were born on October 17, I am the second most successful.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Who\u2019s \u2013 who\u2019s the most successful?\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Mike Judge who did Beavis and Butthead. No.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: No!\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yep. Degree in physics? There\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s a bunch of us, I know. You know, and maybe there are chemists, too. But there\u2019s Zach Weinersmith of Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal. I drew up reading \u2013 I grew up reading Foxtrot by Bill Amend, who also has a degree in physics from Amherst. \n\nBut yeah, I always read comics growing up, like Calvin and Hobbes, the Far Side. I read every Garfield strip published up until I, you know, was in my teens. \n\nBut I figured, oh well, cartooning seems cool. You can sit at home in your pajamas all day and draw, I guess. That sounds like a nice job. But I figured, I guess you have to know how to draw, and also know how to write jokes. So I guess I don\u2019t know how to do either of those. So maybe that\u2019s not the career for me. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know, you can agree, or people can have their own opinions about whether I learned to write jokes, but not being able to draw turned out not to be quite the barrier I thought it was. But \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I think your drawings are pretty good. \n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yeah, no, I appreciate that. It\u2019s \u2013 but what I \u2013 when I started off, I wasn\u2019t thinking of it as comics, you know. So I would draw all the time. I did a lot of doodling in my notebooks, a lot of sketching things. \n\nAnd then you do a surprising amount of drawing in a physics degree. I feel like one \u2013 one hot take I have about physics is every \u2013 everyone who\u2019s getting a physics degree and who\u2019s going to teach should have to take a class where they learn to draw a cube in 3D, and, like, draw, like a few shapes in perspective on the board, because I just have so many memories of a professor drawing like, okay, and then you have this, you know, the particle here, and it\u2019s moving through a plane here. And then you have a perpendicular line here. And they draw it, and it immediately turns into this mess of like a Picasso-like thing. So I took \u2013 I took a technical drawing class at one point, and that was \u2013 that was \u2013 actually turned out to be really helpful for what I did. \n\nBut, you know, so I would be drawing in my notebooks. I would draw fractals, doodle stuff. And then I \u2013 but I wasn\u2019t thinking of that as like comics that people would read. And then \u2013 and then at some point, I started scanning them, and I was like, oh, these notebooks are falling apart. I have a website I\u2019m not using. I\u2019m going to just post some of these online. I\u2019ll like draw a little box around these drawings. And \u2013 and \u2013 and some of them, you know, had a person saying something or some text. And then people like, started sharing them around, and I was like, oh, if people want these, I can keep drawing them, you know, and \u2013 and then sort of fell into cartooning that way.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, what did the progression look like? So you \u2013 were you working at NASA while you were \u2013 when you began xkcd and, you know, sort of doing this on the side while you were, you know, doing imaging systems?\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yeah, I was working \u2013 well, so I \u2013 while I was in \u2013 after my third year of college, I did an internship and a neat program that they had at the local NASA Langley Research Center down in southeastern Virginia, in the Newport News, Virginia Beach area. And I \u2013 while I was working there, I got to know some people and \u2013 and that was around when I \u2013 after that summer, I think is when I started posting my comics online. \n\nAnd then that fall, I was pretty much finished with my classes, but I wasn\u2019t going to graduate till the spring. And so, I \u2013 because I had come in with some \u2013 like, I took a bunch of AP tests. And \u2013 and \u2013 because it turned I out was free \u2013 this is \u2013 this is a tip for college that may or may not apply is when you\u2019re going in, if they have tests you can take to get credit, and there\u2019s no cost to taking the test, take the tests. You might \u2013 you might randomly do better than you expect. I got a bunch of credits that I was not expecting. So I was graduating early, or, you know, I was finished \u2013 I had finished all my stuff and I just had my final project left for my last semester. \n\nAnd someone who I had worked with at that internship got in touch and was like, you know, we were talking about some \u2013 some \u2013 something we had talked about, and then he mentioned, oh, you know, I\u2019ve got a spot in my lab, if you want to \u2013 if you\u2019re interested in working on this project that we were working on. And I said, sure. \n\nSo I started working there before I graduated, and then I was there for most of 2006. But then later in 2006, you know, I was working \u2013 I was working then on \u2013 on robotics and robotic vision and stuff. \n\nAnd then later in 2006, people started asking me if they could order stuff off of my \u2013 my website. You know, oh, can I get your comics on a t-shirt or a poster? And I was like, oh, sure, I could start selling those. And then before I knew it, I was spending more time making stuff from my website than \u2013 than working on robots. \n\nAnd then around that time, the contract I was working on ran out. You know, I was doing these contracts that got re-upped. And then \u2013 and they were like, all right, do you want to \u2013 do you want us to find you another contract or what? And I was like, you know what, I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019ll get back to you on that. But I\u2019m going to try doing this \u2013 doing this comic thing fulltime for a little bit.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Did that feel like a big risk to you?\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: You know, it \u2013 it sort of didn\u2019t. Because it \u2013 it all fit together so well. You know, like, it felt like if I was less, you know, confident, or if I was doing \u2013 if it was less able to support myself with \u2013 with the comics, I could have kept doing, you know, doing NASA stuff until I hit that point. So I think I \u2013 I sort of lucked out in that way. \n\nAnd I was a little bit worried about telling other people. It\u2019s like, does this seem irresponsible? It seems like, you know, I\u2019m \u2013 it seems \u2013 this seems like a good move. But it does seem a little bit weird. And, you know, I remember wondering if my parents would be like, \u201cNo, what are you doing walking away from NASA?\u201d But they really just seemed delighted, as long as I wasn\u2019t going to move back home. \n\nBut yeah, I think it was \u2013 it felt like well, now I\u2019ve I now know these people at NASA. You know, I could \u2013 I worked on this one project, but like, I could come back to them if I wanted, and be like, hey, what else are you working on? I promise not to draw cartoons the whole time, this time. \n\nAnd you know, and I was drawing cartoons, and I was getting messages from people who worked at, you know, in \u2013 in cool, like tech things that \u2013 that I might also want to work in. So I was thinking like, just from a kind of career point of view, this is probably not the worst thing to be doing.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, and so, one of the things I love about your website is you don\u2019t run ads on \u2013 on the comics. So you \u2013 and I want to talk about your \u2013 your books shortly because I think they\u2019re just absolutely fabulous. I\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019m waiting for my \u2013 you know, pre-ordered my copy of What If 2. \n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Cool, thank you.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Which I\u2019m very, very eagerly looking forward to getting.\n\nBut so \u2013 yeah, that\u2019s awesome.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yeah. I appreciate it, appreciate the plug.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, no, no, I \u2013 like everybody should go out \u2013 so \u2013 so they should go out and buy your first What If book and they should preorder the second one like right now. I mean, look, we can go ahead and talk about it. \n\nSo these books are \u2013 they are, you know, sort of long-form extension of what xkcd is, it feels like to me. So like they are trying to describe in a \u2013 in an approachable way like interesting questions or like describing interesting phenomena about the world. \n\nYeah, and some of them are whimsical, you know, like, what would happen if everybody on the planet Earth, you know, jumped simultaneously. But even when they\u2019re whimsical, like the, you know, you walk people through the process of how you would analyze that phenomenon, which is useful. \n\nAnd so, like, I think, you know, sort of sucking people into the process of math and science through whimsy, I think is just genius. Like, my kids love these books. \n\nSo I mean, talk a little bit about like, why you decided to write \u2013 write the books in the first place?\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Well, when I started drawing comics about this science stuff, I really wasn\u2019t expecting it, but people started sending me questions now and then. They\u2019d be like, me and my friend have been arguing over this, you know, Superman physics question, or, you know, this \u2013 this thing about the skyscraper or something. And \u2013 and they were like, but it seems like it\u2019s like, too pointless a question to bother a real scientist with. So \u2013 which is sort of a \u2013 feels like a little bit of a burn, but at the same time, I mean, they were \u2013 they\u2019re like, you seem like you probably have a lot of, you know, free time, or like, you\u2019re enthusiastic about, like, doing a completely pointless, but incredibly hard task, because it sounds funny or cool. And I was like, sort of insulted, but also, they were \u2013 they were definitely right. I was. So I would get these e-mails. \n\nNow like, the kinds of questions that would really hook me were the ones where it seemed like there must be an answer, but I don\u2019t immediately know what it is. And I have a guess about what it is. \n\nAnd so, I would find that someone would send a like one-line e-mail with a question in it, and I would like, spend six hours like, going down rabbit holes of research being like, oh, it must be this, right? And then I look it up. No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that, Oh, man. Well, okay, we could solve it this way, you know, and I would, like, get sucked into that. And I would finally get to the solution, and I\u2019d write them up this whole e-mail and reply, you know, of like, okay, I\u2019ve worked it out, I\u2019ve done this, here\u2019s the citation, here\u2019s the thing, and then send it and then like, the e-mail would bounce or something. And I would be like, oh, okay, you know, they \u2013\n\nAnd then \u2013 and so, at some point, I started thinking, like, if I\u2019m going to put all this work into this, I \u2013 other people would probably want to read these, too. And so \u2013 so I started, you know, sort of soliciting questions and \u2013 and writing up my answers. \n\nBut it really is \u2013 it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s nice \u2013 it\u2019s a way of showing people that you can use the tools of science to, you know, how to answer questions with them. But it\u2019s really more about, to me, it\u2019s like, you can take a question that is really interesting, and \u2013 and showing, like, a way of getting to the answer. It\u2019s not like a way of sneakily giving you science; it\u2019s a way of like, sneakily giving you the answer itself. You know, and like, it\u2019s not that the answer is important, but that\u2019s okay. It doesn\u2019t have to be. It\u2019s like telling you, you can figure this stuff out. You know, there are ways to figure this stuff out. You don\u2019t have to feel like \u2013 like, people don\u2019t like asking questions sometimes because they worry that it \u2013 it makes them look like they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re \u2013 you know, they don\u2019t know something. \n\nAnd so, I try to encourage that, you know, like, in myself, I have a hard time, like, when someone uses a word, and I don\u2019t know what it means. I had a New Year\u2019s resolution a while back, that was like, I\u2019m going to start asking people what words mean, and it was really hard. Like, it was \u2013 I was not expecting that, like, how difficult that is, but then also, they\u2019re happy to tell you. You can just ask. It\u2019s fine, you know? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nRANDALL MUNROE: And so \u2013 so I try to, like, show \u2013 encourage people.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And \u2013 and they don\u2019t think you\u2019re stupid when they \u2013 when they respond, right? \n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like they do not think less of you.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: No, yeah, and like \u2013 like, and then the next time someone uses the word, you don\u2019t have to feel like you don\u2019t know it, because you\u2019ve learned it, you know? \n\nAnd so, with, like, these tools, you know, of \u2013 of science and calculation stuff, like, they\u2019ll give you an answer. They don\u2019t care if the question is, like, pointless or not, or if, like, why you want to know. You know, it\u2019s just \u2013 just like, if you\u2019re curious about something, you can ask. There\u2019s probably an answer out there. If there is, you know, here are ways we can try to find \u2013 find it. And it\u2019s okay to not know stuff and be curious about it, you know?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s such an awesome thing. Like, I do think that curiosity is almost like a muscle. Like, the more \u2013 the more I let myself be curious about things, like the more curious I become, and like I think that\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a good thing, like asking lots and lots and lots of questions \u2013\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yeah, I think \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 you know, maybe even is more important than being able to answer lots and lots of lots of questions.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yeah, I think \u2013 I think that it\u2019s like \u2013 like, sometimes people say like, how do you encourage people to be curious or encourage them to be interested in, you know, science or interested in any of this stuff? \n\nAnd like, I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m not a psychologist. I don\u2019t know, like. I really feel though, like \u2013 like people are curious. Like, it\u2019s a question of like, do they feel like they have a way to get, you know, to satisfy that curiosity? Or do they feel like the things they\u2019re curious about are just like, oh, well, that\u2019s something I could never understand, or that\u2019s unknowable, or that\u2019s like, you know \u2013\n\nLike, this is something that I really \u2013 I really admire Carl Sagan, who had a really good \u2013 I think a lot \u2013 a lot of time, the people who would \u2013 who would write about science or talk about science were kind of, like, smug or condescending about, like, people are just, you know, incurious, or they\u2019re, you know, they believe in superstition, or they\u2019re not scientific or not rational knowledge. \n\nAnd like, I think that that \u2013 that stuff kind of rubs me the wrong way. Like, and I think one thing that Carl Sagan really appreciated is that, like, people are just all looking for answers. And like, if you \u2013 if you don\u2019t offer them answers, you know, if \u2013 if you can offer them answers through science, then they will be interested in science. Like, if you can offer them like, answers, like, here\u2019s a way of figuring out the answers to your questions, they\u2019ll \u2013 they\u2019ll jump at that. And if you don\u2019t, they\u2019ll find someone else who has answers, you know, someone else who\u2019s offering a way to think about the world that \u2013 that satisfies their curiosity, or \u2013 or gives them, you know, a sense of understanding and power. \n\nAnd like, but it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s the same impulse. It\u2019s the same, you know, I want to understand what\u2019s going on here. I want to \u2013 I want to figure out how it all works. I want to answer these questions I have. And I think that\u2019s a pretty universal thing. And it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a question of like, where you go to get those answers and how you go about \u2013 how you go about it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: One \u2013 one of the things that I \u2013 that I really love about some of these old Richard Feynman interviews is like, people would ask him questions, and he would just light up and say, \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting question.\u201d And they \u2013 you know, his \u2013 the questioner would look a little bit confused, like, \u201cOh, well, you know, why is that an interesting question for Richard Feynman,\u201d and then he would explain to you why the question was interesting. And like, he was just totally into, you know, the complexity of, you know, a question that might have even seemed to the questioner, banal. It\u2019s \u2013 so it was \u2013 I know, like, he had a \u2013 he had an interesting philosophy of question asking.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yeah, and it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s sort of, you can always kind of ask why. Like, you know, the \u2013 the two-year-old strategy of like, well, here\u2019s the answer. Well, why is that the answer? Well, I guess because of this. Well, why that? \n\nI think it was Clifford Stoll, the \u2013 the writer and \u2013and computer person from \u2013 who \u2013 who did \u2013 said that in his oral exam for an astronomy PhD, a physics PhD, you know, with a focus on astronomy, the examiner just asked the question, \u201cWhy is the sky blue?\u201d And \u2013 and \u2013 and he answers, \u201cOh, God, that\u2019s a \u2013 wait, I was prepared for all these specific \u2013 Rayleigh scattering.\u201d And then the examiner was like, \u201cCan you explain in more detail,\u201d and then \u2013 and it\u2019s like, \u201cAh, okay, yeah, it\u2019s because of this interaction with the electrons, you know, as the photons move past the atoms.\u201d \u201cCan you explain in more detail?\u201d And like two hours later, they\u2019ve run through like half of modern physics just trying to answer these questions. \n\nAnd I \u2013 and I like how really simple questions, you can kind of keep drilling into them and \u2013 and find more unanswered questions. Although one of my favorite things in \u2013 in the questions I answered in What If 2, I love when you run into a simple question, where we don\u2019t really know the answer. \n\nOne of my favorite examples of that is, until very recently, we did not really understand why ice was slippery, and why ice skates worked. I feel like we\u2019ve sort of finally nailed that one down. We\u2019ve got a rough understanding of like, what happens on the surface of ice that makes metal skates slide on them \u2013 on it. But you know, the common explanation you would hear sometimes about like, oh, well the pressure of the skate causes the ice\u2019s melting point to drop and makes a thin layer of water form, turns out like not to be true at all. And the actual mechanism is like a weird, complicated materials thing.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Interesting.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: And \u2013 and there, you know \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And you explain that in the book?\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: I actually talked about that some in \u2013 in How To. In What If there\u2019s \u2013 in What If 2, there \u2013 there are some fun questions like the \u2013 so there\u2019s a \u2013if you\u2019ve ever tried taking a pair of pliers and crushing a sugar cube in the dark, there\u2019s a flash of light. This \u2013 it \u2013 when I heard that, I was like, that can\u2019t be true. And I like went and got a sugar cube and like pliers. And you have to let your eyes adjust to the dark first. And I like crushed the sugar, and I\u2019m like, there\u2019s not going to be a flash of light, and I crushed and there was a flash of light. Like, it was the weirdest thing. I was like, oh, this is \u2013 and it\u2019s called tribo \u2013 triboluminescence is the \u2013 the term for it. \n\nBut \u2013 and so, someone asked like, how it looks like there\u2019s a little spark. So how much sugar would I have to crush to create a lightning bolt, like with the power and brightness of a bolt of lightning. \n\nAnd that \u2013 and so, there \u2013 there isn\u2019t really a spark, although the process that creates triboluminescence is \u2013 which is not totally understood, does involve like separating electric charges, and then having them equalize in the material, which is sort of like a bolt of lightning. \n\nBut it turns out, it\u2019s like, if you want to ask like, where does the energy come from, why does that happen, how do those charges get separated, why do they, when the \u2013 when crystals of sugar fracture, why do you get light like that? You very quickly run into questions that like chemists who work on it are like, well, there are a couple of ways of looking at this, and we\u2019re not really sure what the right one is. \n\nBut then, as a weird, you can at least say like, well it works because it\u2019s charged separation happens near the fracture plane. And then that equalizes, and it causes an emission of light through this mechanism as the electrons move. And so, you can say it\u2019s sort of similar to how lightning works in that sense. \n\nBut lightning is another one where, you know, going a little bit out on a limb here, we don\u2019t really understand why lightning happens. You know, we understand very well that there is a charge buildup in one part of the storm, because of something to do with the updraft carrying ice, as it \u2013 and as it bounces past the air, you know, moving \u2013 you have the ice falling and the air moving up and \u2013 and it\u2019s like a Van Der Graaff generator, and electrons, you know, move from one to the other and build up at one part of the storm, and \u2013 and there\u2019s a deficit at the other end. So you have a difference in charge that eventually equalizes with the lightning bolt.\n\nBut like, why the charge flows in the direction it does, when you rub a balloon on your hair, or, you know, wind past rain in a thunderstorm, we don\u2019t know. There\u2019s no general theory for why electrons move in the direction they do. It\u2019s just weird materials stuff. \n\nAnd so, like, we don\u2019t understand why lightning happens either, you know, and \u2013 and we don\u2019t understand it. And it\u2019s like a very, kind of basic way. Like, we don\u2019t know why charges build up in one part of a storm. And \u2013 and I think that\u2019s really cool. Like, and it\u2019s really interesting and important, you know, and \u2013 and it does tie into the same problem as like, why crystals flash when you crush them in the dark, and why your hair stands up when you rub a balloon on it. And like these are \u2013 these are interesting, hard physics problems and they\u2019re problems that are trying to answer a question that a little kid could ask. And I think that\u2019s really cool.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s super cool. \n\nSo we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re just about out of time. And so, I wanted to ask one last question that I ask everyone. So you \u2013 you seemingly have a super-interesting day job where you get to go indulge your curiosity and then entertain people with what you \u2013 what you find. But I\u2019m curious what you do in your free time, like when you\u2019re not, you know, thinking about science and \u2013 and writing comics. What do you do for fun?\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: I don\u2019t know. I do \u2013 I do some like, you know, stargazing, astronomy stuff, hiking, and photo \u2013 photography. I\u2019ve got some of those telephoto lenses that you can use, the kind where you can \u2013 you have this little camera, but you can actually like take pictures of Saturn\u2019s rings just by pointing the camera at Saturn and clicking it And so, I have a lot of fun playing with that. \n\nSo I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m subsidizing my interest in \u2013 like I feel like there\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s a sweet spot halfway in between photography and astronomy, where you\u2019ve got a camera that\u2019s like almost a telescope, and you can take pictures of stuff that\u2019s really high and really far away. And I have a lot of fun doing that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s awesome. I have a friend who does astrophotography, and that\u2019s a deep rabbit hole.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: Yeah, yeah, and \u2013 and \u2013 and anything where you\u2019re trying to \u2013 to do a long, you know, deep exposure of the sky, you\u2019ve got to build sky tracking equipment and use software that was written by someone in like 1993 and is unchanged since then. It\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a fun, technical rabbit hole, if you\u2019re inclined to go down those.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, super fun. \n\nWell, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today, and \u2013\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: No, thanks for having me.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: and Moreover, thank you for doing what you do. Like I think it\u2019s an incredible, generous service you\u2019re doing for the world.\n\nRANDALL MUNROE: No, well, thank you. I mean, it\u2019s been a lot of fun to chat about this. I appreciate the fun questions. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Okay, what a great conversation with Randall Munroe. There were so many good tidbits there. I have to start off, my mind was blown that he is the second most famous comic who was a physics major born on October 17. Like that, that blew my mind.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, mind blown. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Completely mind blown. And \u2013 and I am a Mike Judge fan and \u2013 and huge Mike Judge fan, huge fan of King of the Hill, and, you know, Silicon Valley and Beavis and Butthead and all that stuff, but I had no idea that they \u2013 like that he\u2019s \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Don\u2019t forget Idiocracy.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Idiocracy, yes, Office Space. You know, he\u2019s great. Idiocracy, which did predict basically. Anyway. \n\nBut the fact that like, they\u2019re, you know, he\u2019s not the only kind of comic physics, you know, physics major, physicist turned comic is so interesting. \n\nBut, uh, you know, wanted to kind of get your perspective. You talked a lot about this. I don\u2019t know if he would classify himself this way. I think I would. Like, he\u2019s \u2013 he\u2019s, I think, a generalist who knows a lot about a lot of things. \n\nAnd I think that that means that his approach of being able to write his comic and write his books, to kind of explain and go into these areas is really profound, because, as we were talking about earlier, he can create these comics strips that \u2013 these panels that, you know, apply to a large swath of people, even though we feel it\u2019s individualized. But he can do that on just so many different topics. So interesting.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think it\u2019s a \u2013 it is a super interesting thing. And he talked about it earlier with his \u2013 his undergraduate advisor, like telling him, like, you got to specialize, you got to specialize.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And we \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about this on the podcast with other guests. Like there\u2019s such a powerful gravity that exists in some of these science and technology fields to like, try to get people to specialize, and to get like very, very, very narrow. And so, I\u2019m always just really inspired by people who are general. \n\nAnd like, I think the thing that he\u2019s specialized in is like being able to just sort of deep dive into a bunch of things. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But that is a skill. It\u2019s a specialized skill in and of itself.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: It is. Not only that, but, you know, and I say this like as someone, I consider myself a generalist, so I love seeing people like him who are so successful and do such a good job. \n\nBut not only, as you said, can he do these deep, deep dives, but he can make it accessible and understandable to a large swath of audiences. Like you were talking about, you know, the \u2013 the challenge that you had, you know, writing for one of the scientific journals, because just of the array of different audience types.\n\nYou know, when I think about all the people who read Randall\u2019s books, or his \u2013 his webcomic it\u2019s such a vast array of things and he\u2019s covering such a vast array of topics, that it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m so impressed by someone who has the ability to hit the points for both the newcomer and the person who\u2019s really in it, you know?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, and you must \u2013 you must see the same sort of thing yourself like in your career as journalists, right? Like you have to be able to deep dive \u2013\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 into like a bunch of different things and like understand them well enough that you can convey clearly and accurately like a complicated set of ideas.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, no, totally. I mean, and ironically, it\u2019s also something that I do now, you know, in developer advocacy when I\u2019m teaching people how to do something. And I think that, probably similar to Randall, like my whole thing was \u2013 was curiosity, just \u2013 just like the two of you were talking about. Like, I would want to know, answers myself or want to figure something out. \n\nAnd anytime I\u2019m going to \u2013 not \u2013 not every journalist is like this, but for me, certainly, if I was going to write about something, I needed to understand it as much as I possibly could, to be able to convey what I could, you know, to \u2013 to a general audience. And that just came from many times, like, okay, well, what\u2019s \u2013 what\u2019s the most fascinating story, what\u2019s the most fascinating thing to tell is something that you\u2019re curious about, and you want to know more about. And I think that\u2019s what Randall has done fantastically with \u2013 with his books and \u2013 and obviously with \u2013 with xkcd.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And he \u2013 he described it a couple of different ways. Like he said, the \u2013 the two-year-old strategy or, you know, he like talked about Clifford Stoll\u2019s, PhD oral exam, but like this notion of not being afraid to ask why \u2013\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yep.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 and not being afraid to continue to ask why \u2013\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 until, you know, you sort of bottom out on something. Like, more people need to do that.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: 100%. The other thing that struck me as part of that, too, is \u2013 was not being afraid, again not being afraid to ask why. But not being afraid to ask if you don\u2019t know something, not being afraid to \u2013 to come up and say it. And it\u2019s so difficult for us, I think, especially those of us who are more technical, and consider ourselves and maybe are seen by others as having a certain level of knowledge. It can be really difficult for us to ask and say, hey, I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know what this is or \u2013 or I don\u2019t understand this. And the fact that he had that resolution where he\u2019s asking, wanting to say, if I don\u2019t know what a word means, ask about it. I love that and \u2013 and I wish more people would do that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, you know, I know when I was early in my career, like when I was a kid, and like in college and grad school, I had a really tough time sometimes asking questions, just because I was so worried that it was going to make me look stupid, and then \u2013\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I don\u2019t even know, like, you know, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve, you know \u2013 well, I sort of understand why I don\u2019t mind asking questions now, like, what \u2013 what\u2019s going to happen to me? Like, I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m this like, old, you know, privileged man, right? You know, like I can \u2013 you know, you can think I\u2019m stupid. Like I don\u2019t care anymore. \n\nBut like, I don\u2019t know why \u2013why I ever cared? Because it\u2019s such a high cause of, you know, like, not getting your questions answered \u2013\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Or \u2013 and \u2013 and I, you know, I wish, if I have one superpower, like a thing that I could give the world is like, I would just wipe away imposter syndrome. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes. No, and, I mean, I think that\u2019s what it is. I think a lot of people have it. And \u2013 and, you know, as you kind of had mentioned when you were talking with him, people don\u2019t think less of you because you ask a question. And I can even think of myself, if someone asks me, \u201cWell, oh, I don\u2019t understand what this means,\u201d I don\u2019t think less of them, you know. And \u2013 and so, but yet we have this idea that people will think less of us, and \u2013 and will have a lesser respect for us if we admit that we don\u2019t know everything. \n\nI\u2019m with you. I wish that you had that superpower that we could get rid of impostor syndrome, but I\u2019m also equally glad we have people like \u2013 like Randall out there, who are asking these questions and are doing it in such an accessible way, and in a way that, you know, when you look at like the last 18 years or whatever of \u2013 of his comic, you know, I think has probably really catalyzed a lot of people to ask more questions. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And \u2013 and I think he \u2013 he \u2013 it really is, like when I thanked him at the end for the generosity of what he does, like I do believe that, like, what he is doing is an incredibly generous use of like his \u2013 his own curiosity and his own impulse to educate and entertain. Like, it\u2019s just an incredibly valuable thing. \n\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: It really is. It really is. \n\nAlright, well, that is all the time that we have for today.
