{"episode": "EP-37 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast Justine Ezarik", "text": "JUSTINE: Everyone\u2019s like, oh, like, have goals and stick to them. And I don\u2019t believe that at all. I mean, I think it\u2019s great to have goals, but I think if you stray from that goal, you could potentially find something way better.\n\n[MUSIC] \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone.  Welcome to Behind the Tech.  I'm your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we're going to get behind the tech.  We'll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did.  So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what's happening today.  Stick around.  \n\n[MUSIC] \n \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Hello and welcome to Behind the Tech! I\u2019m Christina Warren, senior cloud advocate at Microsoft.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And I\u2019m Kevin Scott. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  And our guest on the show today is Justine Ezarik, also known as iJustine. She\u2019s a techie, she\u2019s a gamer, and she\u2019s one of the top tech female influencers on YouTube. I followed her for many years. I\u2019ve met her a few times. And it\u2019s been so interesting to watch her career trajectory.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, it\u2019s really fascinating. I mean, I admire what she does, in general, inspiring people to get interested in technology, but like maybe even more so like I\u2019m just inspired by her as an entrepreneur. She has \u2013 like she was one of the very earliest people who figured out that there is a way to create content and to engage with audiences using these new technologies like YouTube and streaming. And she pioneered a way to turn that interest into a business, and now it is a big thing, like a thing to the point that both of my children would love to be able to figure out how to be influencers or streamers or whatever you want to call it, which is just it\u2019s crazy how influential she\u2019s been, honestly. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I read a study recently and I don\u2019t know if this is a good or a bad thing, but apparently the number one career that kids have today is like they all want to be creators.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Like that\u2019s their number one career, and \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Look, I think it\u2019s a terrific thing, actually. So the creative impulse in general is a great thing to have. It\u2019s what you have. It\u2019s what I have. It\u2019s like why a bunch of us are out, like trying to make new things to see whether or not they\u2019re actually useful for a large number of people. And I think anything that can make kids want to create things and to create connection among people is good. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  One hundred percent and Justine is certainly one of those who has helped lead the way. All right, let\u2019s talk with Justine. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Our guest on the show today is Justine Ezarik-- a techie, gamer, vlogger and celebrity YouTuber best known as iJustine. She has over a billion views across her YouTube channels. Justine is also an actress with appearances in film and television and authored The New York Times best-selling book, iJustine:  An Analog Memoir. She hosts a podcast with her sister Jenna, called Same Brain, where they talk about tech, video games and food.\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Thanks for having me. I\u2019m so excited. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  It\u2019s so awesome to meet you. I think we\u2019ve had one conversation before when you were chatting with some of the leadership team at Microsoft. But I\u2019ve followed the arc of your career, and the thing that you\u2019re doing, I think, is-- it\u2019s obvious to everyone how relevant and interesting and important it is here in 2021, but you started a while ago. How did you figure out that this was an interesting thing? Did you have any sense that everything was going to blow up the way that it did? \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  No. I mean, I was just a kid that loved technology, and it\u2019s weird because now, like, there\u2019s always, like, the buzzwords, like women in tech, women in gaming. And it\u2019s so strange to me because when I grew up, no one ever, like, thought that that was, like, different. I was never treated differently because I was a girl and I love tech and I love playing games. It was just sort of, like, the people that I was surrounded with then, like, that\u2019s just what we did. Like, we played games. Like, I was just \u2013 that\u2019s something that we loved. And I had never had any intention of this becoming a full-time job. It just sort of did. And I mean, I\u2019ve been doing this for so long, and it\u2019s just so cool to still be able to be doing something that I really, truly enjoy. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Well, let\u2019s maybe dig into that story a bit, because I think that\u2019s just a super interesting thing. So, were either of your parents in tech? Like, how did you first get interested in technology? \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  So, my mom was a teacher, so it was interesting because back then, there were a lot of, like, Apple computers and stuff in schools. So, that was, like, the only person that really ever had them was because of students and teachers and things like that. So, that was, like, my first computer. \n\nAnd then my dad, we ended up getting like a PC later. So, it was interesting because there was just so much support from both sides, and my dad is also super tech savvy. So, he and my mom, like, built our entire house, like, basically with their own two hands. And so, they\u2019re both very savvy in that sense. So, they were always super supportive of, like, my interests as well. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And so, was gaming the primary first tech interest or did you ever do programing or was it BBSs or the Internet? I\u2019ve \u2013 you\u2019re probably too \u2013 too young for BBSs. (Laughter.)\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK: I was really into IRC, so it was maybe like in sixth grade on IRC and just like trading, you know, music and things like that. But I loved gaming, and I had a Nintendo, like, very, very early. And I even remember asking my mom when I was working on my book, I was like, \u201cWhy did you buy me a Nintendo?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that you wanted.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh, okay.\u201d So, it did stem from something that I wanted because I really didn\u2019t remember back then, like, why did we have that? \n\nBut yeah, then I also was very interested in coding. So, around sixth grade, the whole time, whatever, I was really getting into video games as well, I first realized like the Web meant something. And I was like, well, how did they make this? And then when I viewed the source of a website for the first time, that\u2019s when I had this realization of code, and that was something that was creating this. \n\nAnd then I got into Web development and I taught myself HTML. And then I thought that I wanted to be a computer programmer, and I went down that whole path. And then I started loving sort of the frontend design. So, I had a teacher in, I think maybe like in high school, and I would work on getting everybody in my class. I would be making their \u2013 actually making their programs look good and kind of neglecting the code a little bit. And he\u2019s like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to code. Like, you could be a frontend designer. You could do something like that.\u201d I go, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t realize that that was something I could do.\u201d \n\nSo, that kind of put me on a whole other path of discovering photography, graphic design and video production. So, it kind of really did stem from my love of tech and coding. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  You know, the thing that you just said is really important. We,  I don\u2019t think, fully appreciate how important role models are when kids are trying to figure out what it is they want to be and what it is that they could do. Like, this whole thing where you didn\u2019t even understand what a frontend designer was and, like, didn\u2019t realize that was a path. So, I don\u2019t know whether you think about, you know, you have a pretty big audience right now. Like, how much do you think about your job being a role model for kids, like getting them excited about technology and sort of showing them paths forward? \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Yeah, I mean, I think I recently \u2013 well, I guess not that recent because I have been doing it for a while, but I sort of realized how powerful that is, because, like you said, like there wasn\u2019t somebody who I could look up to that was doing this thing that I wanted to do because it wasn\u2019t even a thing yet. \n\nSo, it\u2019s so cool for me to just see how excited, the younger girls are getting about technology. And they\u2019re so excited about their phones or their new laptops, and they\u2019ve started making unboxing videos. And any time \u2013 we haven\u2019t done these recently, but, like, back in the day, whenever you would do meet ups and just seeing people, and I would be signing phones and laptops and devices, I was, like, this is so\u2013it\u2019s strange, but it\u2019s also like this is what I love and, like, I\u2019ve created this community and it\u2019s just so cool to see it. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  So, what did you choose to study when you went to college? Like, did you have a clear sense of what you wanted to do by the time you graduated from high school? \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Well, it was interesting because I kept telling my mom that I, like, I refuse to take my SATs. I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this. I want to do \u2013 I want to \u2013\u201d I knew what I wanted to do. I wanted to do something in computers. But, you know, that whole, I guess, traditional way of, like, going through school and that, like, it just \u2013 like, I\u2019m not a good test taker. And that\u2019s just, like \u2013 so, traditional school for me was very, very difficult. But it\u2019s like the things that I liked, I was so good at, so like the computer stuff. \n\nSo, I end up going to, like, a two-year school, which was for graphic design, video production, multimedia. Basically, everything that I\u2019m doing, I had a crash course of that for two years, and it was just the perfect fit for me. So, I think when kids are looking at, like, what it is that they want to do, you know, I think school is so important, whatever that is. If it is a traditional four year, if it is, like, a two-year crash course, like something like that for me was so perfect. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, that\u2019s awesome. I know the way that I learn is a little bit similar. So, I need to find my own path and, like, I believe everybody learns slightly differently than everybody else. And if you can figure out the thing that there are things that you\u2019re really excited about and, like, you have a way to go immerse yourself in that, like, you can really get ramped up pretty fast on like new things. \n\nI mean, I\u2019ve taught myself how to do so many unusual things by watching YouTube videos and then just practicing. And like, I just really wish that there had been this when I was a little kid, right, because I could have learned so much more so much earlier.\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Yeah,  that\u2019s the thing that I was even thinking about. It\u2019s like, even if this was available when I was younger, would I have taken advantage of that, because I feel like now, as I\u2019m older, I feel like, I\u2019m like, there is everything here at our fingertips. Like, we can do anything. We can learn anything. I think you kind of take that phase of childhood, like, I don\u2019t think \u2013 I don\u2019t know if \u2013 I don\u2019t want to speak on their behalf, but I feel like, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s like you don\u2019t understand until you\u2019re older, like, how incredible and how powerful that is. So, I definitely encourage kids, if there is something that you\u2019re interested in, you do have everything at their fingertips. Like, go for it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  So, when did you really start doing the thing that you\u2019re doing professionally right now, like making videos, connecting with the audience, like, using the Internet to say this important set of things that you have to say to, like, as many people as you could reach?\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Yeah, I would say probably professionally, in 2006, 2007, I think that\u2019s when I finally was actually making money and getting sponsorships, and things like that. I mean, there were obviously very small and very different back then. But I also, before that, was, after I quit my job, I was working just like freelance. So, I was doing graphic design, video production and stuff like that on the side, sort of supports my Internet habits of, you know, like doing the live streaming and things like that, because it\u2019s also weird, because I was one of the first people to ever stream on, I guess it was Justin.TV at the time. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah.\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  But it was \u2013 I mean, obviously that became Twitch, which was also strange because no one was doing live streaming and I was doing it for 24/7, six months straight. And it was just such a weird experience because, like, that is the ultimate way to connect with people. And doing these, like, live streams was easy because it\u2019s like we just met so many people, and everyone kind of became friends in the chat. Like, it was no longer about me. I was just sort of this small factor of, you know, everything that people were doing and they just made friends that way. And it was really awesome. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s super cool. And I, you know, I think sometimes, we forget how quickly things have progressed. Like, one of the things I\u2019m interested in is how did you find courage in 2006, 2007 to quit your job and make this your career, because people can actually have the idea in 2021. It\u2019s like, oh, I want to go be a YouTuber or I want to go, you know, be an influencer on TikTok, or whatnot. And it\u2019s still hard, but, like, it\u2019s a thing at least that you can sort of see a whole bunch of other people doing, and, you know, the same way that, yeah, maybe kids aspire to be a theater actor or a movie star or whatnot, but, like, it just didn\u2019t exist when you started doing it. So, how did you get the courage to do that? \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  I think that\u2019s probably the good thing is because I was young and I really didn\u2019t have any concept of the world. You know, I was actually at a concert last night, and my friend Lindsey Stirling, who\u2019s a violinist, also had the same sort of perspective, because what she\u2019s doing now on tour and being a traveling musician, violinist with costume changes, all of this, 10 years ago, managers, agents, everyone was telling her, \u201cYou can\u2019t do this. This isn\u2019t a thing. This will be nothing. This isn\u2019t \u2013 like, it\u2019s impossible.\u201d And just to see her 10 years later on stage doing that, like, I have that same feeling of so many doors were slammed in my face. Like, everyone was telling me, \u201cNo, this isn\u2019t a thing. Like, what are you doing?\u201d I was getting made fun of.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know. For whatever reason, I was like, I\u2019m having a good time. Like, I love this and I think that there is something here. What it is, I don\u2019t know. And I was just grateful that I did have very supportive parents and supportive friends that were like, \u201cYou\u2019re weird, but whatever. Like, we\u2019ll go along with whatever you want to do.\u201d (Laughter.)\n\nAnd thankfully, I did have that background of being able to do freelance work, you know, graphic design, making websites on the side so that I was able to sort of support my habits or my fun little side projects. I wasn\u2019t like completely homeless.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And so, what were the technical things that had to happen to enable you to do what you\u2019re doing? I mean, so I guess there\u2019s some obvious things, like YouTube had to exist and be at some level of scale. But, like, what else? It\u2019s not just that, right? Like, you have whole bunch of other tools that you use to make your content and to reach your audiences. \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Yeah. I mean, now, it\u2019s so different. I have a computer for streaming, a computer for editing, my travel, my storage, like all of that stuff. So, but then, I mean, it was still so early. So, like the price of these things was just \u2013 it\u2019s so expensive that it was, like, it was unattainable at the time. \n\nSo, like, the camera that I had, I mean, it was a small little, kind of, like, a VHS kind of thing with, like, the little DV tapes. And it\u2019s like that then was, like, thousands and thousands of dollars and the quality was terrible. And that was, like, the cheapest thing that I could find, like, on the market. \n\nSo, now it\u2019s incredible just to see how the price of things have come down. Like, you can create an entire, you know, business and studio on just a phone. Like, a mobile device can do that. And I think what\u2019s so cool is, like, you know, once you actually have these tools and people are able to upgrade and see things that you can do, I mean, it really is endless. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  I guess I hadn\u2019t realized how good the technology had gotten until the pandemic, where as soon as I was spending almost all of my time in video conferences, I was like, \u201cOkay, well, how could I make the sound better, how can I make the video better?\u201d\n\nAnd so, and, you know, the funny thing to me is everything that I\u2019m doing right now, so I\u2019ve got a DSLR that\u2019s sitting above my machine. I\u2019ve got a Shure Sm7b microphone. I\u2019ve got a Focusrite Scarlett, USB audio capture device. I\u2019ve got a \u2013I\u2019m super nerdy. Like, I\u2019ve got a big LED octo bag over my head so I\u2019ve got decent lighting. \n\nBut all of this stuff I just copied from streamers who had figured all of this out. And I\u2019m like, wow, it\u2019s this incredible innovation that streamers have done, like, assembling all of these tools so that they can connect with other people. And, like, now, I\u2019m using some of these same things to, you know, have better meetings. \n\nSo, have you seen anything about what you\u2019re doing change as a result of the pandemic or, like, bigger audiences, people more interesting in some of the tech stuff that you\u2019re doing, like try to get your advice about how to, you know, because we\u2019re all streaming right now all the time, right? (Laughter.)\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  So, I mean, I basically did the same thing that you did. Like, I completely upgraded my setting. And right now, I don\u2019t have it because I just got back from a trip. So, I had all my camera gear and stuff packed. But normally, I do have, like, a DSLR or a mirrorless camera, actually. And then, you know, you end up creating such a good look. Like, your \u2013 like, your view right now, like, people are like, \u201cIs that background real?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s real,\u201d because, like, especially because yours, because you have the nice bokeh effect.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah.\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Yeah. I mean, me and my sister started a podcast during the pandemic and we \u2013 like, now I have a whole Rodecaster system, and we have several of them. And it\u2019s just, like, we\u2019ve got the whole lighting. And it definitely is completely different because a lot of people did not know how to do any of this. In the beginning, it\u2019s like this is something that I live and breathe, and I was, like, sending out extra webcams to friends who weren\u2019t able to buy them, because there was, like, a webcam shortage. And I was like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got a whole box full of those from, like, the past five years of not having to really use a webcam.\u201d\n\nSo, yeah, it\u2019s really cool how that kind of all shifted and everyone kind of adapted to this new kind of lifestyle. And I think integrating this sort of way to do these meetings, I think, is going to save people a lot of time in the long run. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, I remember at the beginning of the pandemic, it got really hard to buy basic stuff. So, like, whatever was on YouTube is like, oh, this is the best, you know, camera for doing live streaming, like, all out of stock or, like, this is the, you know, HDMI-to-USB video capture device, like, all out of stock. (Laughter.) So, it\u2019s really crazy, like, how many people all at once decided that they were going to try to up their game.\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Well, even that, it\u2019s like some of the computers they might have don\u2019t even have it. So, like, they actually could not participate or do their job, which is so wild to think, like, there\u2019s a webcam shortage. That is something that I never would have ever expected. Yeah, I think a lot of stuff during the pandemic, I think really shifted kind of our perspective and \u2013 and realization of how much we do with tech and how far we\u2019ve come. And, you know, for a lot of us, it\u2019s like, oh, this is our way of life like this. This is what we do all the time. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  So, talk a little bit about how it is that you run your business, because in some sense, what you\u2019re doing resembles how people created content for, you know, for a long while now. Like, you\u2019ve got lighting and microphones and cameras, and some of the mechanical bits are the same, but, you know, what you\u2019re producing and, like, how you engage with your audience and how you make money is very different. So, like, talk about how that works. \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Yeah, it\u2019s interesting because it is different for a bunch of creators. I know, like a lot of creators rely solely on merch, and I, for whatever reason, I\u2019m just not a merch person. But that is definitely going to change, because I feel like there\u2019s so much stuff that I want to create and just never really have. So, I think also during the pandemic, that was something that I was like, what am I kind of missing here? And that\u2019s definitely something that we are working on. \n\nBut as far as the business side of it, I do a lot of brand deals, and it\u2019s really fun because I do do a lot of tech. So, there\u2019s \u2013 the tech just is never ending and that never stopped. And it\u2019s still just continues to be so fun because there\u2019s so much tech to cover. So, there\u2019ll be brand deals that I\u2019ll do that can be, like, sponsored integrations for just, like, a one-off video or a long-term partnership, and then, of course, with YouTube, there\u2019s the partner program. So, you get paid off of sort of, like, the AdSense and the ads that run over the video. \n\nSo, that\u2019s kind of the main thing. And then, obviously, like there\u2019s other things like consulting for companies or do I take, instead, if they don\u2019t \u2013 if it\u2019s a startup, if they don\u2019t have a budget to pay, then I\u2019ll work for equity or something like that. There\u2019s a lot of different ways that you can go about it. And it just sort of changes because the world is changing. So, it\u2019s like you just kind of have to mold whatever that project is, whatever brand. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. I mean, I\u2019m watching my 11-year-old son right now who has aspirations to be a YouTuber, try to get started. And, like, granted, I placed a bunch of restrictions on them that an adult wouldn\u2019t have. It\u2019s like, I\u2019ll let you upload YouTube content, but you can\u2019t show your face, for instance. Like, I don\u2019t \u2013 you know, for your own safety, like, I just would prefer you didn\u2019t do that. So, he makes these little animated videos that he uploads. \n \nAnd so, I just watch him struggle with, I\u2019m guessing, the same thing that you all struggle with, which is, all right, I don\u2019t really understand this YouTube algorithm. I don\u2019t understand always, based on the feedback that I\u2019m getting from the people who watch my videos, about what they like or don\u2019t like so that I can make more of stuff that people will like. I don\u2019t understand how to reach new people. So, if I want to get a bigger audience in a way that isn\u2019t just luck, like, how do I go do that? \n\nAnd, like, this is stuff that, like, you, in particular, since you\u2019re one of the very first people who\u2019ve ever figured out how to do this as a career, like you\u2019ve had to try to understand all of these things. So, I\u2019m just sort of curious, like how do you approach this stuff? \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Yeah. I mean, I definitely learned early on that there\u2019s going to be good videos, there\u2019s going to be bad videos, and sometimes, there really isn\u2019t an explanation and then you have to just accept it. There are small things you can do to make changes, but I just try not to focus on the numbers so much, unless there\u2019s, like, a significant dip, and then, I\u2019m like, okay, I need to really kind of go in and assess, because at one point, it drove me absolutely crazy. Like, I was obsessing about numbers, I was obsessing about subscribers. And then when I kind of stopped obsessing about it, it just sort of naturally came. \n\nAnd really, it\u2019s just about creating content someone else is going to want to see. There\u2019s been videos that I\u2019ve been editing and I\u2019m like, I am so bored, I can\u2019t post this. This is \u2013 this is garbage. (Laughter.) And then I just end up scrapping it. And then sometimes, there\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ll also say that. I\u2019m like, okay, let me work through this. What can I change to make this better? And I\u2019m able to make it a decent video, and even though I might not think it was that good, I\u2019m like, \u201cYou guys really like that.\u201d Like, that\u2019s strange. So, it\u2019s hard because you really don\u2019t know what someone\u2019s going to like or what\u2019s going to resonate with people. \n\nI think what\u2019s so cool is the audience, like, is just so vast that even if you\u2019re doing something that is such a niche sort of thing that you think nobody else likes, there\u2019s somebody else out there. It might not be a huge audience. So, it\u2019s like go after that audience and, you know, be the best in that small field, because there\u2019s so many less people doing it and there might not be a huge audience for it, but you\u2019re going to be the best at that. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, I think that\u2019s a really interesting thing that\u2019s happened that is, you know, partly enabled by the technology, because it\u2019s possible for a single person. It\u2019s hard, and I don\u2019t think people appreciate how hard it is to make compelling content and then, you know, just sort of get it distributed. And the audience is so big, it just changes the economics of what content creation can look like. \n\nMost of the stuff that I watch on YouTube is weird. Like, I love to watch \u2013 I love to watch classical pianists practice. \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Interesting.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  So, like, I love, like, weird sorts of cooking videos. I\u2019ve taught myself to be a machinist by watching\u2026And I don\u2019t--Some of the time, I don\u2019t even understand why people post this stuff. Like, why would you, as a busy professional machinist, post a bunch of videos on YouTube and social media about how you do your job, where you are better than the best teachers that I\u2019ve ever seen? So the generosity of that, to me, seems incredible. So, I just love this ecosystem, like how rich it is and how much of this, you know, sort of unusual stuff that you would never find anywhere else. Like, there was never going to be a machinist, you know, television channel, even on satellite or cable. It\u2019s just awesome. (Laughter.)\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  It\u2019s actually funny you say that. Like, why do they post it? I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know. Like, I don\u2019t even know why I first started. I mean, I feel like it was because I was just \u2013 I was entertained by it and, like, I thought it was funny. I don\u2019t know. Like, now, I mean, it makes a little bit more sense, but still, like, he has a very busy day. Like, he\u2019s going out of his way to, like, give that information to people. So, hopefully, you know, it comes back and he\u2019s able to make some money off of the ad revenue and stuff like that. But still, it takes a lot of content and a lot of time to do that stuff. So, it\u2019s like, is it worth it? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. And I think, I mean, I watched this one machinist who posts a couple of videos a week, and I\u2019ve been watching this guy for years. And he was able to quit his job as a full-time machinist to make machining videos on YouTube, which is \u2013 \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  That\u2019s cool.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, it\u2019s cool and it\u2019s mind-blowing. I mean, it\u2019s just \u2013 (laughter).\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And I sort of wonder, for you as a creator, like, this must be true for all creators and artists, how you find that line between serving the interests of the audience so that you can get paid. And, like, paid might be currency or it might be recognition or, like, you know, whatever the value is that you\u2019re getting from the audience, versus what stimulates and fulfills you above and beyond, you know, the paycheck or the fame or whatever else? And, like, it strikes me. I\u2019ve never done this, but I think it sounds hard whenever I think about it, finding that line. \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  It is, and, you know, I think that\u2019s the fun thing about working with brands, is, like, I\u2019m able to sort of do a video that I may not have otherwise been able to, because, you know, they\u2019re supporting that video and I\u2019m able to make, like, something even cooler. But it\u2019s, like, a lot of that content is stuff that I would have already made anyway. So, it\u2019s great to be able to get a cool brand attached to it, because it\u2019s something that I was like, oh, I would have done this and made this anyway. \n\nBut there is kind of that fine line of, like, okay, I\u2019m doing this for them or I\u2019m doing this for myself. And I feel like that also goes back to the beginning of why you\u2019re creating, why you\u2019re making the stuff that you\u2019re making. Like, you have to choose something that you\u2019re interested in. So, I genuinely like what I\u2019m talking about, so it\u2019s easy. It\u2019s like, I\u2019m doing this for myself, but also for them. \n\nIt does get a little tricky, though, because, you know, sometimes with brands, like, they will want you to say certain things. And I think now, like, I\u2019ve done a really good job of kind of, my audience trusts me. So, it\u2019s like I have to have these brands trust me when I say, look, this really bad idea. You shouldn\u2019t do this because I\u2019m going to get made fun of. You\u2019re also going to get made fun of, and we don\u2019t want to do that. So, you have to have, like, that difficult conversation sometimes. \n\nAnd honestly, sometimes you also just have to own up to it. Like, if you posted something that people didn\u2019t like, either apologize or you just kind of move on and be like, all right, that video was bad. Just don\u2019t do that again, and kind of just shift and change. But that\u2019s what\u2019s so great about YouTube, is the audience is vocal. Sometimes it\u2019s negative, but it\u2019s like you have this core group of people, and you know, if you hurt one of them or let them down, it\u2019s like, oh no, I\u2019m so sorry. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And is that, for you, how you have the stamina to do what you\u2019re doing, because I\u2019ve watched a whole bunch of other YouTubers who just burn themselves out because it can be all consuming? And some of them have even talked about that process. Like Casey Neistat, for instance, like, it sounds like he figured out a formula that worked of, you know, like, how do I make content that is compelling enough where it\u2019s going to get a lot of engagement. But the process that he figured out how to do that, which he could repeat, was just killing him, it sounds like.\n\nAnd like, you know, his reaction to that is, like, he\u2019s dialed all the way back now. And he had a little stint, I think, last summer where he was posting videos again and they were really great. And like, you know, now, they\u2019re dialed back again. So, I don\u2019t know. How do you not burn yourself out? \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Oh, I definitely have, and I think it\u2019s just knowing yourself. And because I have been doing this for so long, it\u2019s like you kind of understand when things are getting to be too much, and then you just have to dial it back or you have to find outside things or outside hobbies to just sort of take you out of what you\u2019re doing. And making time for, like, health, fitness and just yourself is, like, I schedule that in now. It\u2019s like everything kind of revolves around that instead of revolving around work. \n\nSo, it\u2019s like I revolve when I can do whatever around, you know, like, okay, so if I can \u2013 if I\u2019m not going to be able to, you know, run during the day, like, I have to do it really early. So, it\u2019s kind of like revolving those things and just like making sure that, like, your health and wellness and just, like, your mind is okay, because if you can\u2019t come to the table and be able to do your job, it\u2019s like you\u2019re going to be letting down all of these people. \n\nAnd like, they can sense it online. Like, they\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019re not stupid. They know when, like, you\u2019re having a bad day. And also, there have been times that I\u2019ve been filming, and I will just be like, \u201cI\u2019m having an awful day. Like, I physically cannot do this.\u201d And I know that, at this point, I\u2019m like, I just \u2013 we\u2019re going to have to put it off until tomorrow. So, it\u2019s like it\u2019s okay to, like, listen to yourself and know when things are too much, because it\u2019s like we\u2019re not machines, unfortunately. (Laughter.) So, we operate a little bit differently. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  I don\u2019t know whether this is true for you or not, but I have that all the time, like, when I get to a point where I\u2019m overwhelmed and I need to stop. And I always feel guilty about stopping. (Laughter.)\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Right. I definitely do. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And I don\u2019t know whether you feel guilty about it, but, like, learning to just sort of say, okay, well, you know, I may feel guilty about it, but, like, this is the right thing to do, and, like, I\u2019m going to go do it anyway. But I still feel guilty to this day, like I\u2019m sort of letting myself down or letting other people down by, like, not working as hard as I think I ought to be working.\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Right. And then, you\u2019re like, I\u2019ve actually been working very hard, when you really think about it. (Laughter.) You\u2019re like,  I\u2019m overworked. That\u2019s why I\u2019m feeling this way. Yeah, I know (crosstalk/inaudible). But I mean, sometimes, it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s like, I was like, is this actually \u2013 is getting this thing done worth me, like, breaking out in tears because I\u2019m so stressed out and upset. I\u2019m like, no, it\u2019s not. I need to go for a walk. And, you know, just sometimes, those simple things of just going outside or going for a walk, like, it helps so much. It sounds cliche, but it really does. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  That\u2019s such good advice. Everybody should just sort of pause and absorb that. And this is the, you know, the thing with folks who do actually burn themselves out because they can\u2019t figure out a way to moderate. \n\nThen this thing that they were doing is gone. Like, they can\u2019t do it anymore and, like, they can\u2019t share it with the world anymore. And like, 0that\u2019s way, way worse than just, like, having a thing be a few hours late or waiting until the next day. \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Yeah. And it\u2019s like, right now, so I\u2019ve kind of taken it sort of easy this beginning of this year, just sort of for myself and just everything. And me knowing that tech season is starting basically, like, right now, it\u2019s like knowing that I\u2019m going to burn myself out, so it\u2019s like I\u2019m fully prepared for that. So, it\u2019s like if you\u2019re prepared for that situation, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve been preparing for this for four months. Like, I know these next two months are going to be ridiculous. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah.\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  And going into that, I know. And, you know, I am lucky that my sister is super supportive and I also have a great camera person, and he also helps edit. And it\u2019s like we know this is go time and just \u2013 just have that mentality of like, okay, do what we have to do to get it done and then we can relax when we need to. And if we really have to take a break, that\u2019s okay. We are important. (Laughter.)\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, it\u2019s almost like training to run a marathon, right? Like, you\u2019ve got to prep for it, because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to \u2013 you won\u2019t be able to run the whole race. \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  So true. Like, yeah. I\u2019m like, okay, we\u2019ve been resting. We\u2019re ready. (Laughter.) It\u2019s tech season. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  That\u2019s awesome. So, I\u2019m curious to hear if you have a set of things that you do for your work that you think are much harder than \u2013 than people realize. So, like, I\u2019ve got a handful of maker videos that I have produced and posted on YouTube, just so I could understand the process of what it takes. \n\nAnd, like, one of the shocking things to me is it takes a lot of work to produce five or 10 minutes\u2019 worth of good content. Like, I look at what Mark Rober does and I can\u2019t even conceive of, you know, how much work must go into these, you know, 15-minute things that he\u2019s \u2013 that he\u2019s making, because it\u2019s like 40, 50 hours just for my sort of crappy 10-minute videos worth of filming and editing and voiceover work. \n\nAnd so, and I don\u2019t think people appreciate it because you see the ten minutes of video at the end, and you\u2019re like, oh, wow, that\u2019s \u2013 you know, it\u2019s almost like the better you make it, the more \u2013 the more people take for granted what must have gone into it. (Laughter.)\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Right, yeah. Everything just takes so long and a lot of times, a lot of my videos, I don\u2019t script them. I just, like, sit down and start recording. So, that for me, that was working for a while until I realized how much time I was wasting, because I would just go on and ramble for two hours about \u2013 I\u2019m like, what am I even talking about? This has nothing to do with, like, this product review. (Laughter.) \n\nSo, I started trying to at least, now, script them a little bit because I was wasting space, like, my storage. I\u2019m like, I\u2019m wasting not only time, but also space, storing all of this nonsense of stories that I\u2019m never going to even use. So, I think that is also something I started doing, just a script to sort of make things a little bit more efficient. \nBut it\u2019s really the whole process. It\u2019s like when you think about everything that goes into it from just setting up, making sure it\u2019s okay, the sound, the lighting, the actual recording, the prep work that goes into making sure I scripted everything, the unboxing, even the cleaning up of cardboard boxes is \u2013 honestly, it really could be a full time job for somebody here. Like, we would have a box recycling person because I spent hours breaking down boxes, and making sure that they\u2019re in the recycling.\n\nAnd then, even from that, the shooting, and then we have to, like, save the footage. We have to edit, and we back up the footage to make sure. Then we export, upload, thumbnails, replying to comments. I mean, it\u2019s hundreds and hundreds of hours per video that, you know, people don\u2019t really see. And then, when I kind of break it down like that and I think about it, I\u2019m like, did I lose money on this project, because I think I might have, by the amount of hours that we put into it. (Laughter.)\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  I don\u2019t know whether this is true for you. I can easily imagine if \u2013 if I were going to take these maker videos that I have produced and, like,  do that as a serious thing. I think it would take a long time and a lot of engagement to get to the point where I could hire someone to, or, like, outsource some of the work where it would even be enjoyable doing, because there\u2019s some parts of it that I just don\u2019t like. \n\nLike, I hate editing. And it\u2019s so crucial to getting a good product at the end. But, like, I\u2019m just terrible at it and I have no patience for it. And so, like, the first thing I would want is to, like, find an editor who can help me out. \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Yeah, and I mean, I think that is the thing. It\u2019s like find somebody to do the thing that you really don\u2019t like the most, and that would be super helpful. But I love editing, which is the problem, because it takes a lot of time. And if I\u2019m editing, I can\u2019t be on camera filming more or doing anything else. So, I, for the longest time, maybe until the past three years, like, I was editing absolutely everything myself. Like, no one else was editing. But now, I mean, I still edit a few videos here and there, not as many as I used to, but I still do maybe, like, half, maybe a little less. I\u2019m not sure, it depends. \n\nAlso, like, I sometimes know that if I\u2019m shooting a video and it\u2019s going to be a disaster to edit, like I almost feel bad. Like I don\u2019t want somebody to have to sift through all of my mistakes. And it\u2019s hard because I\u2019m there doing it, and I know in my mind when I\u2019m saying things, like, I can just, like, do this and get it done. \n\nBut that\u2019s definitely something that I do need to sort of let go a little bit more so that I\u2019m able to do other things, is the editing. But man, it\u2019s like I love it so much, though. So, that\u2019s the problem. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  So, for things like that that you love and that you\u2019re good at, how do you teach someone else how to do that in a way \u2013 like, they\u2019re not going to do it exactly like you, but, like, how do you teach them to do it, you know, well enough where it\u2019s above your bar so that you can scale, because at some point, like your business gets big enough where you actually have to give up some of the things that you love?\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Yeah, I was even talking to another content creator friend, and they were like, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t even look at my TikTok. I don\u2019t \u2013 do I even still even have a Twitter?\u201d And I was, \u201cYou have millions and millions of followers on all of them and you \u2013 you don\u2019t even know?\u201d (Laughter.) And that, like, hit me to the core, because I was like, I still actually love doing this. And like, they\u2019re super successful and super creative. And it\u2019s like, for them, like, they\u2019re like mentally, I cannot be on and I can\u2019t see that. I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m good at and leaving the rest to somebody else. \n\nAnd so, I think there\u2019s a lot of creators like that, but then there\u2019s also people who are really actually in their uploading and adding thumbnails. And a lot of that stuff is wasted time. Like, I know I could be doing something else probably better with my time, but giving up that sort of ownership of it is very difficult. And, like you were saying, how do you teach somebody? I mean, I think it\u2019s a lot of time, too, and if they kind of get your vision and watch your videos, and I think a lot of it is timing, too. \n\nSo, it\u2019s just a lot of kind of working on things and saying, okay, maybe we can do this differently or why don\u2019t you try this? And it\u2019s also kind of good sometimes having somebody different perspective, because it\u2019s like I\u2019m so set in my ways. It\u2019s like, all right, maybe let\u2019s give me a little kick here. Let\u2019s  try something a little different. So, that\u2019s always super helpful, because I think a lot of us kind of get comfortable. \n\nAnd that\u2019s one thing that, like, I love being comfortable, but I also now have learned to hate it, because I feel like I\u2019m not growing and there\u2019s no change happening. It\u2019s just like, cool, I\u2019m just chilling here. This is great, everything is good. And I\u2019m like, something is wrong. We need to \u2013 we need to get uncomfortable. Anytime I get into my set and I\u2019m like, this is perfect, let\u2019s destroy it and we\u2019re going to start over. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. Well, I think that\u2019s a really good mindset to have, because the space in which you operate is evolving so quickly. I mean, and you\u2019ve been doing it long enough, you know, maybe longer than anybody where you\u2019ve just sort of seen the full spectrum of change. (Laughter.) Like, when you started, there were no iPhones. There were, you know, like, smartphones were a very different looking thing than they are right now. Like, you were the first person other than Justin on Justin TV, right? \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  So crazy. Yeah, it\u2019s like, and now, just like looking back on kind of the whole picture, like it doesn\u2019t even make sense. Like, what was I doing? I honestly don\u2019t even know. Like, I was just having fun. And I think that is something that, like, we really need to enjoy whatever we\u2019re doing. And it\u2019s like if you\u2019re passionate about anything, like, you really can make it be something. \n\nIt\u2019s going to take a lot of work. I mean, there\u2019s been ups and downs. I mean, I was, like, not even able to pay my rent at some point. And I was, like, moments away from getting evicted. And my landlord, bless his heart, back in Pittsburgh, I was like, \u201cI promise, I have one more project. Like, it\u2019s going to \u2013 everything\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d And like, you know, just having people that are supportive and kind of, like, believe in you and sort of give you that little bit of lenience, like, I am forever grateful. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, every successful person that I\u2019ve ever met and, like,  success is, you know, success can be, you know, you or success can be, you know, someone who is just feeling, you know, that they\u2019ve got fulfillment in their life. But everyone that I\u2019ve ever met, like, has had, like, these moments of grace, and compassion, and serendipity, and, you know, good fortune that have helped to get you through. \n\nSo, like this, you know, moment of compassion from your landlord, like, that was probably like a couple of things, like, you know, at some level, you know, she or he had to have had faith in you that, you know, that whatever it was that you were doing was going to actually make enough money so you could pay your rent, right? So, it wasn\u2019t just giving you a pass. It was like they were believing in you a little bit, right? \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Yeah, and I think that goes a long way. And I think compassion and kindness can go such a long way. And this was interesting. So, we were in Hawaii filming a project, and me and my sister were there for a month. And the last day, I, for whatever reason, left, like, my small bag. Like, and I shoved it behind the seat. And somebody broke into the car, stole my bag, and, like,  my wallet was in there. (Laughter.)\n\nAnd I made some video and I was, like, trying to, like, make light of the situation, just, you know, because I was like, this sucks. I was like, man, if anybody can just \u2013 you can keep the money. You just \u2013 can you turn in my ID so that I don\u2019t have to go to the DMV because, like, that was also a nightmare, and I had to travel. And we, like, went around and people were so kind. Like, we were pulling security footage from various gas stations and, like, all these places. I basically, like, followed the crime as it was happening. So, I was like, man, this is wild, what\u2019s happening right now. (Laughter.)\n\nBut somebody found my ID and they turned it in and said they saw it off of Instagram, that I had lost it. So, it\u2019s like the kindness that we were showing to people who were helping me, like, we were giving them gift cards for helping, like, if the pulled security footage. So, I was like, I\u2019m repaying you. And it\u2019s just like the kindness comes back. And it\u2019s think it\u2019s something that, like, my mom and, like, my family is always kind of, you know, instilled in us, and it\u2019s sort of just resonates. And it\u2019s like, why would I want to be mean to somebody? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah.\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  And I think, you know, going back to, like, troll comments and things like that, it\u2019s like you see that stuff and it hurts so terribly. But it\u2019s like, how does that person feel? They have to be in such a place of pain to ever say that about somebody else. And so, it\u2019s like I have compassion for them. And I\u2019m like, oh man, you\u2019re trying to make me feel bad, but it\u2019s like, I know you\u2019re probably going through even tougher times. Like, you like to kinda have some forgiveness. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  That is an amazing way to look at the world. I think if we had more of that, like we would have less of this, you know, sort of screaming at each other that we have right now.\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Well that\u2019s hard with social media, because it\u2019s like everybody has an opinion, they have a voice and it\u2019s like, it\u2019s incredible that we have that, but it\u2019s like no one\u2019s the same. And in text, things can be taken so out of context that it\u2019s just so vicious. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Well, I know one thing that I do all the time is, like, I will get irritated about something and then write a 500-word e-mail that is just awful. And then I\u2019ll write it, I\u2019ll reread the e-mail, and then I\u2019ll just delete it. (Laughter.) No one deserves me clicking \u201csend\u201d on those things.\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  (Laughter.) I do that on Twitter. I\u2019ll be like, I\u2019ll write a mean tweet. I\u2019m like, okay, I wrote it; delete. I\u2019m not going to send it. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah.\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Or sometimes, it\u2019s also nice to, like, kind of bounce ideas off of people. Like, I will write the tweet. I\u2019ll send a screenshot to my sister and be like, should I say this? She\u2019s like, no. So, it\u2019s like having that person that\u2019s like, no, you shouldn\u2019t do that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, and I think that\u2019s the thing that we\u2019re missing a lot right now. I mean, it\u2019s great that you\u2019ve got your sister, but, like, just being able to, like, push pause on your emotions for a few seconds, like, it\u2019s a pretty important thing to have. (Laughter.)\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  It is, because it\u2019s just, everything can get so heated and it\u2019s fueled by emotion. And people have been stuck in the house for, like, a year and a half and, like, there\u2019s no clear end in sight. And it\u2019s just so much misinformation. So, it\u2019s like, just breathe. Namaste, go do some yoga, or something. (Laughter.)\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. (Laughter.) So, you know, back to this point around how much change there\u2019s been in the sort of social media and content ecosystem over the past 15 years. What\u2019s interesting to you right now? And like, what are you excited about, going forward? \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  So, I\u2019ve, strangely enough, been so interested in TikTok, mostly just because of it\u2019s where I\u2019ve actually been spending most of my time consuming content. And even creating for TikTok is different because it\u2019s \u2013 like, you have \u2013 to create for TikTok, you have to be a part of TikTok. Like, you have to see what people are doing and you have to be a part of sort of the community and see the memes. And it\u2019s just, it\u2019s a whole ecosystem in itself. And I do feel like I create differently for each platform, and it\u2019s not really something that, like, I\u2019m doing, like, on purpose. It just sort of happens. Like, Instagram has a different vibe to it. Like, I post different things there. \n\nTikTok, during the pandemic, I got really into it, to the point that my friends had to have an intervention, which was one of my favorite videos that I\u2019ve made today. We made, like, a TikTok intervention, because it was, like, a joke \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 but everything that was happening there was actually very, very real. So, it was like TikTok kind of had this community where you could be yourself. I could be \u2013 it felt like the original days of YouTube. Like, I was just being silly and crazy, and they\u2019re like, who is this person? I go, no, this is me, actually me. (Laughter.) Whereas YouTube, it\u2019s kind of become a little more serious. It\u2019s become learning and educational and tech focused. So, it\u2019s weird because it\u2019s all sort of shifted naturally into sort of different places.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  My daughter, who\u2019s 13, you know, we had a rule. Like you can\u2019t have an iPhone or a smartphone until you\u2019re 12. And so, she got a phone a year ago, and it\u2019s locked down in a whole bunch of ways. \n\nAnd one of the things that she was desperate to get on the phone was TikTok. And I\u2019m like, you know, I don\u2019t know \u2013 know whether or not we should have \u2013 have our 12 year old daughter \u2013 she just turned 13 \u2013 on TikTok. But I let her have a TikTok account, mostly because, you know, she had something that she wanted to say, and the way that she was going to say it was through TikTok. \n\nAnd so, she\u2019s got an account. It\u2019s private. You know, she\u2019s not blasting stuff out to the \u2013 to the whole ecosystem. She\u2019s got just her friends on her, on her account. And it\u2019s like this way that they are sort of doing these creative things to show to each other. So, like, rather than drawing something in a sketchbook or, you know, like goofing off with each other, like on, you know, old handset telephone like I used to do with my friends when I was a teenager, like she\u2019s using this as the medium. \n\nAnd it\u2019s really interesting. Like, her motivation for being on TikTok is different, I think, from a whole lot of people\u2019s motivation to be on TikTok. And I just realized, at some point, that maybe everybody\u2019s motivation is slightly different, you know, when they\u2019re using these things. Like, there isn\u2019t just one thing. Like, oh, I want to be famous. Like, I\u2019m going to, like, that\u2019s probably actually the worst motivation for being on any of these things. (Laughter.)\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Well, and that\u2019s what\u2019s so cool about TikTok, is a lot of these people, like they\u2019re just creating for the sake of creating. And the TikTok algorithm is so incredible that it\u2019s able to surface content that you might not have ever seen. So, you could have zero followers and overnight, you could have millions and millions of views and followers. \n\nAnd it\u2019s weird because the community is so oddly supportive. It\u2019s like they want to see people succeed. Obviously, I\u2019m sure in every platform, like, there\u2019s a negative side to it. But for what I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s super positive. And, you know, just seeing that is so cool. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, I mean, I think honestly, one of the things that maybe makes TikTok a little less toxic is the comment section. Like, you have to do real work. Like, if you\u2019re in the flow of just flipping through videos on TikTok, like you\u2019ve got what, the heart count and the comment count, and, you know, some other stuff sort of sitting there on the side, but, like, it\u2019s not front and center. Like, the video, the piece of content is the front and center thing. And you\u2019re going to consume that and probably just flip to the next thing, and you\u2019re not even going to click on this stuff that\u2019s on the side. \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  That\u2019s actually a good point. I never really thought about that because it is a process. Like, where YouTube or Instagram, it\u2019s like the comments are right there and you could just hit it. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah.\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  And I think sometimes, people are swayed by the comments. So, if you see a video and you see people saying, \u201cThis sucks, this is terrible,\u201d you\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right, it does.\u201d And if you don\u2019t see the comments, like you\u2019re able to have that first opinion by yourself. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Oh, for sure.\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  So, and if you don\u2019t like it, just wipe away. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  There is occasionally like some sort of meta controversy, like, about content that then makes me not enjoy the content anymore. And then I\u2019m super disappointed on YouTube. (Laughter.) And like, you know, TikTok, it\u2019s just a little more focused on the core content and, like, getting you through as much of that content as possible. \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Yeah, and it\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s obviously, like, there\u2019s, like, the Instagram has reels now and YouTube has their shorts. And it\u2019s like TikTok is doing one thing and they\u2019re doing it very well, whereas a lot of these other companies are trying to do that also in addition to everything else. It\u2019s something that I kind of miss about, like, the old days of, like, social media, because everyone wasn\u2019t just trying to do what everybody else was doing. It was like, hey, look, we\u2019re Twitter, we\u2019re going to do this and we\u2019re going to do it great. And, you know, I think it\u2019s just like kind of sticking to that I think is very important.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. So, we\u2019re almost at time here. I want to be respectful of your time, but I\u2019ve got two more questions for you. One is just advice that you would give for kids who are thinking about what they want to do in the future. And like, you know, maybe to anyone who\u2019s sort of thinking about like, hey, I want to be a content creator, like, what advice would you give to folks?\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  So, it\u2019s weird--everyone\u2019s like, oh, like, have goals and stick to them. And I don\u2019t believe that at all. I mean, I think it\u2019s great to have goals, but I think if you stray from that goal, you could potentially find something way better. And I think, like me wanting to be a programmer, like that was my goal, I want to do this. I may have never straight away and started doing video or photos and things like that to lead me to what I\u2019m doing now. And I think just be flexible and kind of going with the flow and sort of figuring out things is honestly great. So, it\u2019s like have goals, but don\u2019t be afraid to stray from them. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Awesome. But, you know, you\u2019re also driven at the same time. It\u2019s really interesting hearing you talk. So, like, I think that flexibility is, and awareness of what\u2019s going on around you and with yourself is, like, that sounds like one of your superpowers, but you\u2019re also driven, right?\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Sure. And I mean, it\u2019s hard because there are so many different people. And it\u2019s like my other sister, she\u2019s our middle sister. Like, I could never see her doing this. You know, it\u2019s like there is a type of person that this is for. But I feel like if anybody wants to do it, like, it really is possible, but there\u2019s hard work involved. Like, it\u2019s not just, hey, I woke up and I\u2019m going to post a video. Like, there\u2019s so much that goes into it. \n\nBut if you do genuinely enjoy it and if there is a part of the process that you aren\u2019t able to do or you really don\u2019t like doing it like you, you don\u2019t, like, enjoy the editing as much, you\u2019ll find people around you that can support you and kind of fill in the gaps. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. That\u2019s awesome, awesome advice. So, last question. So, and maybe, maybe this has already been asked and answered, given how public a figure you are, but I\u2019m just sort of curious. Like, outside of, like, this work that you do, which consumes an enormous amount of your time, what do you do for fun? \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Oh my gosh, it\u2019s so funny because this is something I, like, I want to talk about more than anything. So, I started training jujitsu about three some \u2013 three and a half years ago, maybe.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Nice.\n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  And that is something that has completely, absolutely changed my life. So, for the first year, I was like, I\u2019m not going to talk about this. I\u2019m not going to post anything. I didn\u2019t talk about anything. I told the gym, I was like, I don\u2019t want anyone posting that I\u2019m even here. And it was, like, until I got my blue belt, I was like, then maybe I will actually post and say if it\u2019s something that I\u2019m doing. \n\nBut martial arts has become such a huge part of my life, almost even more than tech. Like, even when I was in Hawaii this past month, I basically was there. I did, like \u2013 I was just training jujitsu. I was doing \u2013 I started training light sabers, so doing, like, light saber combat and light saber things from \u2013 which stems from a martial arts called kali, which is a Filipino martial arts. And I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just \u2013it\u2019s so empowering and the amount of knowledge that is out there for these things, like we\u2019re talking about machining. I mean, I spend most of my time watching jujitsu videos like on YouTube. (Laughter.) So, it\u2019s like my entire algorithm is, like, oh, an unboxing and jujitsu. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  So I know a lot of people now, actually, who are like very into jujitsu and, like,  maybe the first time as an adult, like I know Anthony Bourdain, like, was into jujitsu and, like, I was a huge fan of his work. And I was like, oh, that\u2019s sort of unusual. Like, this tall, skinny chef guy is, you know, training martial arts. So, like, what is the attraction to that for you? \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  I mean, for me, I just felt, when I walked into that gym, I just felt I was at my lowest point. I felt incredibly weak. I felt just I was, like, depressed, like, it a super bad point in my life. And, like, I was like, I need to do something other than what I\u2019m doing. And then, when I walked into that gym, it was incredibly humbling because nobody cares who you are, what you do. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re on the mat, you\u2019re there to learn, you\u2019re there to train. And it\u2019s just, for me, it kind of puts so many things into perspective, mostly because I wanted to learn everything so incredibly fast. \n\nAnd, you know, as a white belt, like, you really \u2013 like, you think, yeah, I\u2019m doing such a great job. And then somebody comes in and crushes you, and then you just go home crying. You\u2019re like, oh, man, I know nothing. And it\u2019s like every single time, it\u2019s like every time you level up and you learn something, that just causes another problem. But it\u2019s just such a vast variety of things that you learn. And it\u2019s so empowering when you actually are able to start leveling up and actually learning things. \n\nAnd it\u2019s honestly one of the most rewarding things that I\u2019ve ever done. And I think I learned the most when I got injured for the first time because I was going too tough. I wanted to learn everything so fast. And that taught me to slow down and kind of enjoy the process. Like, you\u2019re not going to learn everything in this first year. So, if you keep getting hurt, you\u2019re not going to progress. So, it\u2019s like that injury taught me to kind of figure out what else I could do when I couldn\u2019t be training. \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I started the other martial arts, Kali, which is more kind of, like, hand-to-hand combat with, like, various sticks and different weapons. I was doing that while I was injured. And then it\u2019s kind of \u2013 that sort of has played into my life a lot, where if there\u2019s a problem that I\u2019m having, I\u2019m like, okay, I myself cannot do this, but what else can I do to work around that issue to make it work? So, it\u2019s like martial arts has taught me so, so much about, like, myself, and it\u2019s just such a rewarding experience. \n\nAnd I think from that, my biggest piece of advice to anyone is, like, have a hobby that you do outside of anything. And just go, set phone down and just be. And I mean, that took me like 13 years to kind of figure that out. (Laughter.) And, you know, when I did, I was like, this really is life changing. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  That is super awesome. And with that, thank you so much for talking with us today. This has been really super interesting. I\u2019m such a huge fan of what you do. \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Thank you.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  It\u2019s just awesome to have you out there in the world. Thank you so much. \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Thank you. No, I appreciate it. This was really fun. Thanks for having me. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Super cool. \n\nJUSTINE EZARIK:  Awesome.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  So that was Kevin\u2019s conversation with Justine Ezarik. You know, listening to her talk about her story, I was struck again and I kind of admit, I\u2019d kind of forgotten-- our career paths are remarkably similar. We\u2019re the same age. We got started online about the same time. Obviously, she went more in the video direction. I took a more written approach, but it was so interesting just, I think, hearing about A) how she got into tech and B) just the story of her career, and I was honestly kind of struck by it \u2013 A) again, because like I said, it was similar to mine, but is also just not the typical story that we hear a lot of people who are interested in tech. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, and I\u2019m always inspired by that and just sort of fascinated how people even get the courage to go do these things. So when you are charting a new course, it is so easy for everybody around you to sort of dismiss what you\u2019re trying to do to say it\u2019s stupid or silly, or that you\u2019re going to fail and summoning the courage to go do the thing anyway because you believe in it is just, I mean, it\u2019s inspiring and like to see it work. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  It is very encouraging. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  No. One hundred percent, you know, I mean, like I remember when she used to \u2013 back when Justin.tv, which is \u2013 which became Twitch, but back when it started, it was it was livestreaming, usually what\u2019s now known as IRL streaming. But that was basically what it was. And she would live cast her life, and it was completely new and there weren\u2019t many people who were doing it. Justin Kan was doing it, she was doing it. And then to just see the business that she\u2019s built, you know, like, not only has she continued to be a creator and influencer and put out great content, but she\u2019s actually \u2013 and I think that this is applicable even for people who might not want to be on \u2013 on that type of creative thing, the business that she\u2019s built has been really inspiring and really amazing to watch come together. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, and I can say when Justin.tv started and when she and Justin were doing this stuff, you know, they had a camera strapped to them 24 by 7 we\u2019re broadcasting their life. I didn\u2019t really get it, and I certainly did not appreciate that they were figuring out a template for a way for people to assemble a whole bunch of technological components in a new way to reach an audience. And, and like so much of what I consume now \u2013\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Is that stuff.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  It\u2019s, it\u2019s exactly that stuff. It\u2019s, it\u2019s not the, you know, 24 by 7 IRL stuff, but it is like little episodic views into people\u2019s lives, whether it\u2019s someone who is a cooking enthusiast or, you know, like I like watching people practice playing classical piano.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Yeah. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  It\u2019s like it\u2019s just these things that you get to see that you just wouldn\u2019t otherwise. And like, they are the ones who pioneered this stuff, it\u2019s just great, I think. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  No, I totally agree, because the technology obviously is what allowed that to become more democratized and allowed people to be able to do that. But then you had the personalities and the people who were willing to A) put it out there and show, yes, this can be compelling. And then I think, you know, there were a number of people who were doing those things at the time. Very few of them have stayed around, let alone have grown into, you know, big brands. And so that\u2019s another thing to not \u2013 not that that has to be the goal, but I think it\u2019s been really impressive to see, with Justine, especially since she started, you know, in her twenties, had the foresight to say, okay, I want to make this into a career and I\u2019m going to figure out a way to make this into a business because it wasn\u2019t a business then and there wasn\u2019t a path that you could follow to make that into something that you could actually turn into a career.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, and I think the really interesting thing is like, we honestly all owe them a debt of gratitude, I think, because the fact that they pioneered this stuff and they created not a small business ecosystem around streaming meant that a whole bunch of technology was in place when the pandemic started, where we all sort of kind of turned into streamers over the past 18 months. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Yeah, yes. No, that\u2019s been the joke I\u2019ve been making with my friends is that like we\u2019ve all become, you know, Twitch streamers over the last 18 months because we had to, and I had a slight advantage over some other people because I already \u2013 I\u2019ve always had camera stuff and I\u2019ve done that sort of thing. I had audio equipment and some video stuff, but certainly not to the extent of, you know, people like Justine and others. And it was interesting, you know, when I got up to speed, I\u2019m sure that you found this too, you know, I almost found myself becoming a consultant for like friends and family on how to do their own setups. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  And I thought about people like Justine, and I was like, you know\u2026 not that she needs to, and she\u2019s doing plenty well on her own, but it\u2019s like the stuff that she does we\u2019ve now seen a direct one-to-one way where it\u2019s not just from a consumer standpoint, it can actually be an enterprise or, you know, a standpoint, you know, it (crosstalk), and there\u2019s so many different things where once you have figured out how to get the process down \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  It can be incredibly, incredibly useful. But it can also really kind of change the game for things and open up access to opportunities and into resources that people might not otherwise have had and.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Oh, yeah.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  And, and so, you know, seeing that and seeing how that can become more accessible to everyone, I think is awesome. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, I totally agree. And I don\u2019t know whether this was the case with you from last spring, but when I was trying to get my AV game into a better state for prolonged remote work or for being able to do TV interviews \u2013\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Or keynote conferences or whatnot, like the way that I figured this stuff out is, I went and watched a bunch of videos \u2013\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  From gaming streamers to see what they were doing. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  No, that \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Because they were the pros. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  No, that\u2019s exactly what I did. I did the exact same thing, and then I went to like YouTubers that I liked, who I knew had like a fast turnaround system. I was like, okay, you know, many of them put their gear in you know, the description boxes, which was very useful and to say, okay, what\u2019s your setup? And, and fortunately, a lot of them would do behind-the-scenes streams. I\u2019m like, okay, this is how I set it up. And I was like, yep, this is what I\u2019m going to take on, because even though the context is different and the content might be different, this is what we want to achieve. And, and so it was great to have those examples out there because we all had to kind of become home broadcast studios. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, it\u2019s super cool, a strange and fascinating world.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  A strange, fascinating world, indeed, and Justine has been such a good influencer, and I like that, you know, she is conscious about the fact that she is a role model for the next generation coming up, like your kids, right? Because they see her as somebody who has done this and has been successful and has also been true to who she is as a person. \n\nYeah, and she\u2019s sort of fearless with what she does.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Like she is \u2013 you know, more so than most of the rest of humanity has figured out who she is in public, but she\u2019s been relatively fearless in the way that she has embraced opportunity and technology and business, and we even chatted a little bit. It, it\u2019s not like the things that she\u2019s pioneered have remained in stasis.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Like, you\u2019ve got a bunch of new stuff coming along like TikTok, for instance, and that won\u2019t be the end of it either.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  No. No. Well, this is actually what\u2019s always been \u2013 what\u2019s been impressive to me, about here, is that she has lasted for this long, because again as I mentioned, early on, like in the Justine.tv, like live, you know, life streaming days, you had a number of people and most of them have fallen off. And then every time a new platform comes out, again, you kind of get the next wave of \u2013 you have people, like you know, Vine was big, and there were a lot of people who were Vine stars and some of them were able to translate, some of them weren\u2019t. But what\u2019s been impressive about her is that she\u2019s been able to master these different networks and stay relevant.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  But also stay true to who she is as a creator and as a person.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, and that is a super interesting thing because not everybody is able to do that. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  No. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Some people are not interested. Like you look at Mark Rober and \u2013\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Mark makes one, high production value, you know, 20-minute-ish video a month.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And like, he has figured that out, and it\u2019s awesome. He\u2019s, he\u2019s almost like the, you know, the modern moral equivalent of MythBusters, right? He\u2019s sort of figured out how to do that on his own and be the entrepreneur of that. There are some people \u2013 like I forget who they are, but like, there\u2019s a TikTok star right now who got up to a hundred million followers and got offered a TV show. Not clear that that\u2019s going to \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Charli D\u2019Amelio, yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  In that direction, yeah. And so, you know, like these people like Justine who can navigate multiple generations of technology, multiple generations of media, multiple \u2013 you know, different ways \u2013\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Multiple generations of audiences, frankly, right? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, yeah, for sure. So it\u2019s just impressive. And like she has such an easygoing way about her. You know,  she\u2019s just super impressive.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Totally agree. It was a great conversation and it\u2019s great to seed someone like her out there. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  All right, well, that\u2019s it for the show today. You know that we always love to hear from you. Please send us your comments or questions any time at behindthetech@microsoft.com and don\u2019t forget that you too can be an influencer. That\u2019s right, so please, tell colleagues and friends about the show. Thanks for listening. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  See you next time. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\n"}
