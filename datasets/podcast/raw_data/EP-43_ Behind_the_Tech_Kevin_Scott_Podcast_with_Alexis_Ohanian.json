{"episode": "EP-43  Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Alexis Ohanian", "text": "HOOK: I hoped people would say, \u201cI read it on Reddit.\u201d I don\u2019t think anyone to date has, but that was the dream.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we\u2019re going to get behind the tech. We\u2019ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what\u2019s happening today. Stick around.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello, and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Christina Warren, Senior Developer advocate at GitHub.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And our guest on the show today is Alexis Ohanian, and he is known for so many things in the tech world, but perhaps he is best known as being the cofounder and the executive chairman of Reddit, which he launched as part of the very first Y Combinator class back in 2005, and today he\u2019s running a venture firm called 776. In fact, he was also once my Lyft driver.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Wow, that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s awesome. I mean, like Alexis may be the \u2013 you know, the \u2013 the king of coincidences as far as guests go. So, he and I overlapped at the University of Virginia, when he was an undergraduate and I was a PhD student in the computer science department. \n\nSo, I don\u2019t think I was ever his TA, but there is a distinct possibility that my wife was his TA given that he was a history major, and my wife is \u2013 was a history PhD student there while he was a student.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: That\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s amazing, and I \u2013 I\u2019m so looking forward to the conversation that you two are going to have because he is so interesting and has done so many things over the last, you know, life 15 \u2013 16 years or so, so I \u2013 I can\u2019t wait to hear what you talk about.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: For sure.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Alexis Ohanian was the cofounder and Executive Chairman of Reddit, which he launched as part of Y Combinator\u2019s first class in 2005. In 2010, he cofounded Initialized Capital with Garry Tan with notable early-stage investments and Coinbase, Patreon, Ro and Instacart. He returned to Reddit full time in 2015 to help lead it as an independent company, eventually stepping down from the board in protest in 2020. Last year, he created 776, a firm that operates like a tech startup deploying venture capital. Alexis is married to tennis superstar Serena Williams, and they have a four-year old daughter. We are so glad to have you on the show today, Alexis. Thank you for being here.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Oh, thank you for having me, Kevin. This is going to be fun.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, yeah, I\u2019m really psyched to talk about so many things, but we love to start these conversations by going all the way back to the beginning. So, I know, like me, you are a UVA alumni, but how did you get interested in technology and programming, computer science as a kid.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Well, I guess I have you all to thank a little bit for this. I remember \u2013 gosh, I remember the day, I managed to successfully convince my parents to buy a computer, and it was a 486SX25 \u2013 25? I mean, it was an early one of the DX.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Faster processing power, more processing power. It wouldn\u2019t let me play a few games I wanted, but anyway, I wasn\u2019t going to complain. This was a huge investment for my parents, huge. Neither of them had any idea what to do with a computer, and I\u2019ll never forget \u2013 I mean, these were the \u2013 even just the most basic thing of getting, I guess it would have been Windows 3.1 started, made me feel like a hacker, because you\u2019d be sitting there DOS, and you\u2019d just be like, okay \u2013 and as a kid, I must have been, ah, let\u2019s see \u2013 8, 9, 10, someone can fact check how old I was, but like \u2013 you know, as a kid, you\u2019re sitting in front of this screen that your parents have no idea what to do with \u2013 I mean, neither of my parents ever used it. They were confused by it, but you know, credit, they had the foresight, but you just I don\u2019t know I couldn\u2019t help but feel like a little superhero.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Because I was like, oh, man, I can do things my parents don\u2019t understand, like this is kind of bad and fun and cool, and like who knows what I could do with this thing.\n\nAnd, and then before long, I started playing videogames. I remember Scorched Earth was one of the ones that was preloaded on there, and I\u2019m playing this game as a little, you know, a few-pixel-sized tank, you know, launching nukes and all these other bombs, MIRVs. I remember I was \u2013 okay, and I\u2019m watching this all happen, and I\u2019m like, this is so cool, like, so this is a videogame, like this is fun, and it wasn\u2019t long thereafter that I\u2019m like, okay, well, wait \u2013 there\u2019s code that makes this work, and you know, because it was such a pain in the ass \u2013 and now I\u2019m really getting into trouble here on the Microsoft podcast. \n\nIt was such a pain in the ass to deal with things like drivers \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, yeah \u2013\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: \u2013 and everything else that you really had to earn it, just to get your games to work, often. And because of that, I really started to think about, well, okay, well what makes these things work? And then it\u2019s like, okay, it\u2019s programming. You get a couple of books out of the library, and the only programming class my high school had\u2014shout out Howard High School\u2014was Pascal \u2013\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: And so, I took it every year, because it was the only class, and the teacher was like, \"Alexis, you\u2019re still in this Pascal class, like why?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \"Well, because I want 45 minutes every day to be on the computer, and I\u2019m just going to \u2013 this is all I can get here, so this is all I\u2019m going to try to take.\"\n\nAnd it was through this concept of, \"Hey, I can create stuff,\" and I think, probably like a lot of kids my age, I wanted to be a game developer because of that, but thankfully \u2013 thankfully, at least for my career trajectory, I got a book on HTML and was like, \"Oh, cool, I can build websites,\" and there\u2019s always a part of me that loved the design element, and frankly, I just loved the immediate gratification.\n\nAnd so, like \u2013 at the same time, I downloaded the Quake II source code and was like, \"Oh, man, I can build my own Quake II mod.\" It was much easier for me to then, at the same time, just fire up the GeoCities website and build a Quake II fan page, and be like, \"This is my fav \u2013 I love the railgun,\" and like, you know, animated GIFs, and marquee all this just obnoxious graphics, but it \u2013 that immediate satisfaction of like, \"Oh, I can write code, have a thing in front of me, and anyone in the world can see it,\" was a drug.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Now, I didn\u2019t realize that the page counter at the bottom was a pageview counter and not like a unique visitor counter. It took me a while, because I was like, \"Oh, my god, there are thousands of people looking at my Quake II website.\" It was just me reloading, but this drug in a you know, probably at that point ninth-grader \u2013 tenth-grader was so powerful, and I just fell down this rabbit hole of \u2013 now, before long, I was building websites for total strangers that I met on the message boards who didn\u2019t know that I was like a ninth-grader. \n\nThey just knew that I could do a thing that they couldn\u2019t. I had a skill that they didn\u2019t have, which is building websites, and I would do it for nonprofits, and I\u2019d do it for companies that were paying me money. It was absurd, right? And that, you know, compared to all the schoolwork I was doing, seemed so much more important and so much more relevant, right \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Like why am I doing this random schoolwork? I get to go home and a thing that is a real skill that has real value, today, and no one judges me for being a kid. They just \u2013 they know I have a valuable skill they don\u2019t have. And, and it just started this, this feedback loop that I just \u2013 I never broke free from. And even though I majored in history and business at UVA, I still was programming. I was still taking courses there. I was a history \u2013 my mom found me community college classes, back at HCC, Howard Community College, that I would take in the summer, just to get better \u2013 back then, it was like Java, and I was taking like 3DS Max classes for 3D modeling. There wasn\u2019t I could not get enough of it, and I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just such a \u2013 it\u2019s my happy place.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: And even to this day now, and I barely write any code these days. Even if I\u2019m just designing product for 776 that we\u2019re doing or working with a founder through product decisions and whatnot, even that \u2013 it\u2019s just my happy place. It\u2019s where \u2013 they call it the zone of genius, where you just feel like you\u2019re doing exactly what you need to be doing... my flow state.\u201d \n\nIt pisses off my wife sometimes because I can fall down that rabbit hole and just be lost for hours.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: But I\u2019m like, \"I\u2019m in my flow state. You can\u2019t ruin my flow state.\"\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: And, and it\u2019s something that I just \u2013 like I said, I feel so grateful that that computer landed in front of me at such a young age, and that  my parents gave me the freedom to just dive in, and, yeah, once I got the internet connection it was just game over.\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think you\u2019ve said a whole bunch of really important stuff. And one of these things is \u2013 so Satya talks sometimes about this notion of falling into the pit of success. And, you know, what he means is like, you know, sort of finding that thing that starts a feedback cycle that just makes you want to do more and more of the things that create more and more success. \n\nSo, you know, like, as a kid, you didn\u2019t know that you were falling into this pit of success. And like, there was a whole bunch of timing, but I wonder, you know, now that you have a kid, and you think so much about community and you care so much about the technology world, and I wonder about this all the time to like, what should we be doing more of to get kids or people in general to fall into one of those technological pits of success? \n\nI mean, I guess it\u2019s sort of your job now as a venture capitalist and an incubator of companies, like you\u2019re trying to teach people that.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: For sure. There are definitely things I think about in the context of being a father that I\u2019m trying to \u2013 I\u2019m trying to sow those seeds of curiosity and interest. So, I play a game that Olympia really likes, right now, called Papa Robot, and it\u2019s just \u2013 she\u2019s four, so just to level set here. We\u2019re not programming quite yet, but when she\u2019s playing Papa Robot, you know, Papa can follow very simple commands, like forward, left, right, back, and she\u2019s learning how to move me around.\n\nAnd I take it very literally, right, very, very literally. So, I\u2019ll walk into a wall, and she\u2019s learning how to move Papa Robot around in a way that, like you have to understand how to talk to a computer. And I was inspired by a \u2013 I think it was an Instagram reel or a TikTok vid, or one of these things that was \u2013 went viral, of another programmer asking his kids to write down how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and he did the same thing \u2013 I mean, these are older kids, but you know, they\u2019re laughing their faces off because they\u2019re like, \"Papa, like how come you didn\u2019t \u2026 you know, remove the lid of the peanut butter??\u201d And well, it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t write down, you know, remove lid of the peanut butter, you just said get the \u2013 like put peanut butter on bread.\n\nAnd so, the papa is putting the jar of peanut butter literally on the bread, and it\u2019s even those little, fun exercises that I want to try and create \u2013 I want to create these opportunities for those sort of dots to connect, and for her to be like, okay,  I have to talk to computers differently than I talk to Papa or other people. And, and so, I\u2019m keen on \u2013 and look, there\u2019s dozens of great startups that are doing versions of games for kids to learn programming, all kinds of offline and online ones, and \u2013 and I do hope \u2013 I mean, gosh, especially right now, Kevin. \n\nIt\u2019s, it is such a massive, massive, massive advantage to be fluent in just really any part of technology, I mean, generally curious about technology at a young age because this generation is going to \u2013 like, if you are a part of this movement, you will benefit so much as a career, as a lifestyle. Like it\u2019s, it\u2019s this technology is going to afford great, great outcomes to the people who are connected to it and able to take advantage of it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: And unfortunately, in a lot of cases it\u2019s going to leave behind a lot of folks who aren\u2019t. Creating those success pits for people to fall into where they find themselves really generally enjoying and curious about the things that they\u2019re learning and the things that they\u2019re doing. I mean, it\u2019s the best feeling on the planet. \n\nI have had hard days, for sure, at work, but they still haven\u2019t been as hard as like my sister who is a nurse.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: I could never do her job. I would last one week, and her job is vital, and \u2013 and none of us are \u2013 are building robots to do that job anytime soon. I joke with her. I\u2019m like, \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually possible,\" because if the robot were capable of doing all the things, she as a nurse does in a day, it would have to be so self-aware that it would look around and be like, \"There\u2019s no way I\u2019m doing this job. Bye.\" \n\nThis is when they decide to just take over, because it requires a deeply empathetic human and a creative human, and a strong human to be able to do all that work.\n\nBut I look at the work that I do, and every single morning that I\u2019ve gotten up, since I graduated from UVA, I\u2019ve looked forward to the work that I\u2019ve done because it somehow touched a nerve of passion, and I don\u2019t take that for granted at all, right?\n\nI saw both of my parents work in jobs that they kind of liked, but they needed to do to pay the bills.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: And it\u2019s such an amazing time right now because so many people in our generation who have just realized the thing that they just love doing gets to be the thing they do, for a living, and it touches so many parts of culture now, and business and everything. Technology is at the heart of it. \n\nSo we need to do more, and I like leading this new generation and funding this new generation of CEOs because they\u2019re so much smarter than I was. They\u2019re so much further along than I was coming out of college, because like \u2013 you know, 2005, startups were still kind of weird and nuanced and different, whereas today, they just come out with so much more expertise, so much more ability, so much more foresight.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, so \u2013\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: It\u2019s a whole new world.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Another thing that you said that is super interesting is you described this state that you \u2013 sorry, I\u2019m going to wait for my air compressor to stop running.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Are you mining a bunch of bitcoins back there?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: No, no, I literally \u2013 my, my shop here \u2013 or my office is in the middle of a machine shop, so I have a seven and a half\u2013 horsepower rotary screw compressor that just decided to cycle.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: I love that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s an awesome thing to have because making things in this shop is a little bit like meditation for me. Yeah, so there, the compressor is off.\n\nI mean, but it\u2019s one of those things where I have a hard time actually doing meditation, like the \u2013 I you just sort of look at me, and like I was never wired for like sitting very quietly and reflecting on, you know, my state of being, like not a thing I can do easily. \n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: I hear that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But like, going to do something where I put my hands on a thing, and I am just like completely and utterly absorbed by what it is that I\u2019m doing, like that\u2019s good stuff, which sort of brings me back to this thing that I was going to bring up. You mentioned a few minutes ago that you described some of what you were doing when you\u2019re programming or making products as being in that flow state, to your wife, and like your wife is like an elite athlete, arguably the greatest tennis player of all time. \n\nSo, like, she must understand this notion of like being in the zone, and like being in the zone and being in flow state are sort of the same. They\u2019re very similar phenomena.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: A hundred percent. So, yes, but here is the unfair advantage I have. Like, I can react to when I am most suited for that state. So, right? She has to show up. Whenever they say the match is going to start, and it\u2019s not even always a consistent time, because if you\u2019re not on first, it\u2019s whenever the previous match finishes.\n\nSo, she has to train \u2013 she\u2019s had to train her body and her mind to get into that \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: \u2013 when the time calls for it, and do it in front of millions of people, et cetera, et cetera, it\u2019s way harder. And I get to do it, and most of us get to do it on our own schedule, right? Because I block times in my day, because I have never exercised that muscle of like, \"Oh, I\u2019ve got to get into the flow state,\" right, got to get focused, so I\u2019m terrible at it, but I have the freedom of being able to let the muses kind of come to me.\n\nAnd so, I can be sitting there, thinking about a problem. I can go for a walk with my dog. I can go feed the chickens. I can come back and be like, \"Oh, it\u2019s on,\" like, let\u2019s go, headphones in, and it\u2019s such a privilege to be able to have that ability.\n\nSo, I get to float around my workday being like, \"This is amazing,\" whereas, for her, getting into that state is a part of doing the job, and it\u2019s one more reason why she is who she is.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Because she\u2019s got to show up for it, and it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, I have to ask her if there\u2019s a hint of jealousy there because sometimes it shows up for me, I\u2019m not as much of a night owl as I used to be, but it would definitely show up for me, at like\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Nine-thirty or ten o\u2019clock, Olympia is in bed, and I\u2019m like, \"Babe, I have to get up, like I\u2019m not doing anything shady, I\u2019ve just got to get in front of my computer and get to my office,\" because like \u2013 it\u2019s on, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: And, and that\u2019s just not a thing that \u2013 it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not \u2013 there\u2019s not a 10 p.m., like, \"Hey, Babe, I\u2019ve got to go and hit some balls on the tennis court,\" type \u2013 you know, energy \u2013 it\u2019s not \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And that\u2019s super interesting, like I never thought about that before. I guess I am similar to you, like, I can tell you what times of day I\u2019m more likely to be able to get into flow state than not. It used to be that I was \u2013 and maybe all of us were like this, I was a night owl. Like I would stay up until like 3 or 4 a.m., like sleep until the middle of the day.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Yeah, yeah?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, I remember when I was \u2013\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I begged and pleaded my PhD committee to schedule the oral part of my qualifying exams for an afternoon because I was terrified that if they scheduled it in the morning, I was going to fail.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: You\u2019ve got to sleep. No, oh, man, well, I\u2019m glad it worked.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But so, like, I mean, it must be an incredible thing to be able to turn it on or to, you know, like create the conditions where you can sort of get into it on, on command.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: For sure, but it\u2019s also taxing. It makes the relationship, at least as I\u2019ve seen it, it makes the relationship to it very different.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: And I don\u2019t know, outside of athletes, I haven\u2019t worked with many folks who can do that, who can get into it, and that\u2019s part of the reason why I hope we can create \u2013 I mean, I think about this a lot with our org design, and \u2013 and just even as we think about meetings, as we think about, like things within our organization. I\u2019m default assuming. Maybe this is the wrong thing, that people are just like me, but that it is much better if we create an environment where folks on our team have the freedom and the bandwidth to be able to find those states as it makes sense for them.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Rather than trying to prescribe it, because I just \u2013 this is one more reason why I think folks who \u2013 athletes in particular, and but anyone who has to conjure up and create that environment on command is just operating at another level.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Because, I know, if you told me, \"Alexis, the only time you\u2019re going to get is like when I tell you when the bells rings, like you have to start being creative and doing your best work,\" I mean, that sounds like hell, right? That sounds like a terrible, terrible work environment.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, but I think what you just said, like \u2013 anybody who has ever been able to get themselves into a flow state knows that you\u2019re so much more productive and it\u2019s so much enjoyable than anything else, so being in an environment that prevents you from getting into it is just so frustrating.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: It\u2019s toxic, yeah, it\u2019s terrible. PG had a really good essay about this. It\u2019s the difference between, what did he call it, managers and engineers? And, and that always resonated with me in a big way. And even as I became a manager, I just \u2013 I still very much have this tension because I don\u2019t want \u2013 like, I know it\u2019s an important part of the job. I know it\u2019s, and I like other humans. I\u2019m not like opposed to it, but I still think about those windows of my day, and I still think about that time where I\u2019m like, \"I have to make sure that I\u2019m creating these opportunities for me to have a window,\" where I think I\u2019m likely to get into that state, and then also not beat myself up if I\u2019m staring at a screen for 20 minutes and it\u2019s not happening, and just say, \"Alexis, dude, get up, take a walk,\u201d like it\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s a weird dynamic, and then also trying to create an environment for others to have that as well, while still having, you know, a high-functioning org, is \u2013 it\u2019s a wild balance, but the best companies do it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Let\u2019s jump back a second to college. So, you didn\u2019t major in computer science, like why did you choose history and \u2013\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: You know, I don\u2019t think I was cut out to do the engineering school, and maybe this is a problem of design. You know, you were required to enroll in the engineering school the first year.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: And I, it\u2019s not that I have commitment issues, I really didn\u2019t want to limit myself, and yes, you could take classes in the college in addition, but like and I\u2019m sure there were some double-majors who did engineering and \u2013 and something in the College of Arts and Sciences, which (sorry this is very inside baseball) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: But I was just showing up. I had no idea what to expect at college. I mean, neither of my parents really went to college. I didn\u2019t have older siblings. I was just like, \"Well, okay, I\u2019m at school now. This is fun.\" And I didn\u2019t want to be pigeon-holed, and frankly, I just didn\u2019t I couldn\u2019t commit, and I figured, you know what, I can still take CS classes, and I still enjoyed doing it for fun, but I really loved history.\n\nI took \u2013 this actually ties into the firm. So, the first class that I took, the first history class I took, the first year, the first semester, was Ancient Greek History, and I loved it. It was amazing. Professor Lendon \u2013 I mean, I was regaled, every day, from start to finish, in class, like it was awesome. And I actually declared my history major, first semester, first year.\n\nThis is why I know I don\u2019t have commitment issues. It\u2019s just I needed to be sitting in that class and \u2013 and just be hit by this, and be like \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: \"This is so fun,\" and \u2013 and you know, 776 is the year, BCE, is the year of the first Olympic games. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s awesome.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: So, it all kind of comes together, but I loved it, and I think \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m actually \u2013 I\u2019m friends with President Ryan, who is amazing, he\u2019s the President of UVA, now, and I\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019ve had some conversations about this, where I\u2019m like, \"Dude, what if \u2013 I know it\u2019s a radical thing. I know the university has been around for a while, I don\u2019t want to disrupt TJ\u2019s vision for it, but like, what if you really reimagine this thing from first principles and say, like, why are they even here?\"\n\nThey\u2019re here, students, to like figure stuff out, to find hopefully that passion, and then hopefully come out of this thing with the opportunity to, pay off their student loan debt, and have a career that is fulfilling and satisfying in all the ways that it can be. And I don\u2019t know.\n\nI mean, I\u2019m obviously happy with the way things turned out. I don\u2019t think I would be the founder I am if I hadn\u2019t been a history major, so there\u2019s my endorsement for the humanities.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: I think it\u2019s helped me tremendously in every one of my jobs, but no, I wasn\u2019t cut out for the engineering school.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, you were there from \u201801 to \u2013\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: 2001 \u2013 to 2005 \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, so it\u2019s hilarious. It\u2019s highly unlikely that I would have been your TA in any of the computer science classes because \u2013\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: But maybe.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: By \u2013 by \u201801, I was almost through, I wasn\u2019t TA-ing anymore, but it is \u2013 it is possible that my wife, who was a history PhD student could have been one of your TAs. That\u2019s just crazy.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Amazing. Gosh, what a wonderfully small world.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s a wonderfully small world. So, you went from UVA to having this idea to like go create a company, like did you have the idea for Reddit, and then you went to Y Combinator, did you got to Y Combinator and like discover the idea for Reddit there? Like how did all of that happen?\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Oh, yeah, well credit to PG and Jessica for rejecting us, spoiler. So, I had a run a forum in college, so I had this phpBB forum. It was called Eyeswide.org \u2013 hopefully, noone is going to way-back machine that, and it had maybe like 500 members, a pretty active community of people just talking about, like news and politics, philosophy, very like angsty college kid type stuff, and I loved it. And I had been doing community building as like a Quake II clan leader, as an EverQuest skilled leader, and I just loved it.\n\nI mean, I officiated a wedding. It\u2019s funny, everybody is talking about the metaverse. The metaverse for me started in like \u201898 \u2013 \u201899,when a buddy and I officiated a wedding in EverQuest.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Nice.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: For  some of our guild members, and I mean, I was just this high school kid, I didn't even know anything about the people themselves, other than their \u2013 you know, their screennames, but like there was this world of community that I deeply understood through high school and college that I honestly never thought could be a business, and at the time, my cofounder Steve had seen \u2013 you know, Sheetz Gas Station, had those touchscreens, even back in 2004, that would let you order food without waiting in line.\n\nAnd so, he was remarking to me about how much he hated waiting in line for those, and how he wished he could place the order from his phone, and I\u2019m like, \"Dude, that\u2019s a good idea,\" and I\u2019m like, \"We could call it My Mobile Menu, or MMM, for short,\" and this could be like a business. And at the time I had \u2013 well, just before that, I had walked out of an LSAT because I, like a foolish history major, thought I should be a lawyer, studied for a whole year for the LSAT, and then I get there, and 20 minutes into it, I just put down my pencil, and I get up, and I leave.\n\nBecause I was hungry, and I wanted to go to the Waffle House on 29, more than I wanted to finish the LSAT. And I\u2019m sitting there eating that waffle and I\u2019m like, \"Gosh, I really should not be a lawyer.\" I just walked out of the Waffle \u2013 or I\u2019d just walked out of the LSAT to go to a Waffle House, like this is not my calling, and realized I had to be something else.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s a good Waffle House, though. \n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: It\u2019s a great Waffle House, and I \u2013 you know, it changed my life, seriously, and because I went back to my dorm, and I said, \"All right, I want to start a company,\" and recruited the smartest person around me to go do it. And so, MMM was going to be this way to order food from your phone, skip the line, but it\u2019s 2004, so there was no smartphone. It was going to be text-based.\n\nI\u2019d worked in a Pizza Hut through high school, and so they had a little printer in the back, and I was like, \"Oh, they\u2019re already taking \u2026\" They were already basically printing out orders, and we just had this coming through text, and we\u2019d come up with some clever way \u2013 you won\u2019t even need verification. It would just be like the last four digits of the cellphone, whatever, you can work it out.\n\nI did the worst job of CEO\u2019ing this because I talked to all of the restaurateurs on the corner. And I was like, \u201coh, hi, you know, I\u2019m going to be graduating next year from UVA. And I\u2019ve got this idea for a company called My Mobile Menu. You interested?\u201d and they all said, yeah, because, you know, they don\u2019t want to crush the hopes and dreams of college kid. \n\nAnd so, in my head, I\u2019m like, \u201coh, my God, I\u2019ve just closed like 30 customers!\u201d But they\u2019re \u2013 that deal was not done. There was nothing other than, yeah, that sounds good. And \u2013 but in my naive CEO mind, I was like, oh, man, we\u2019re killing it. \n\nWe go up to Boston to hear, during our spring break, senior year, fourth year, to hear Paul Graham speak. And he gave this talk called \u201cHow to Start a Startup,\u201d and we went because it\u2019s like this is the perfect thing for us to be hearing. This guy, Paul Graham\u2019s a pretty prolific writer and successful startup founder in the first dot com boom. And afterwards, I went up to him and basically said, hey \u2013 probably called him Dr. Graham. \n\n\u201cHey, Dr. Graham. It\u2019d be so worth buying you a drink to tell you our pitch about our startup. We came all the way up from Virginia.\u201d And I think he was surprised that we made it all the way up from Virginia, frankly. And he was like, \u201cOkay, sure. Whatever, weirdos who came all the way up from Virginia to hear me talk. I might as well let you get me a drink.\u201d\n\nAnd we sat down at \u2013 it\u2019s now gone, but the Cafe Algiers in Harvard Square. And over a cup of coffee, not a drink, I pitched him on it. And I made it like 10 seconds into the pitch, and he just gets so excited. He just talks for the next 20, 30 minutes and he\u2019s so hyped about it. And he\u2019s like, \u201cThis is the future of ordering...everything.\u201d And we left and he was like, \u201cYou all have got a pretty good shot,\u201d and we felt great, and a few weeks later, followed up with him.\n\nAnd he said, \u201cHey, look, I\u2019m going to be announcing this thing soon. You should apply.\u201d And a day or two later, he posts on Slashdot that Y Combinator the summer founders program was taking applications. And we applied, we get invited up, gave the best pitch of my life, I felt. And PG calls me that night and he says, \u201cWe\u2019re rejecting you.\u201d (Laughter.) And I was feeling so good. And I was like, \u201cDude, you called us up here, and \u2013\u201d anyway\u2026 \n\nWe were already drinking, so it was good. We were celebrating prematurely and drinking, and then it went right into misery drinking, which was helpful. And \u2013 and then, on the train back, PG calls and he says, \u201cLook, still don\u2019t like your idea.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cThanks. Why did you call me just to tell me that?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cBut, but, if you change your idea, we\u2019ll fund you because we like you two and you know what? Let\u2019s see what you can do.\u201d And so, I was like, \u201cLet me get back to you.\u201d I had to play it cool. And we talk it over, and obviously, we were going to do it. \n\nSo, I get off at the next train stop, get a train back to Boston, call Paul back and say, \u201cLook, Paul, all right, we\u2019ll do it. You\u2019ve got to fly us back home, though, because we missed our train.\u201d So, that was the little negotiation. He\u2019s like, \u201cWhatever, fine.\u201d \n\nAnd then we get up and meet PG at the office, the early YC office, and we just talk. And to PG\u2019s credit, you know, he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, what do you do all day to solve a problem that you have?\u201d And I was telling him about this forum that I had started, and he was like, \u201cOh, well, how do you like \u2013 how do you like Delicious?\u201d And I was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s Delicious?\u201d \n\nAnd it\u2019s funny, Josh is now in LP. And, you know, it\u2019s \u2013 Delicious in many ways was like the OG Pinterest. If they had just made it a more graphic-forward interface, it\u2019s just bookmarking. It\u2019s the same thing, but you know, at the time, Delicious was this great social bookmarking app where you could just sort of see what in aggregate people were saving for later. And it had touched on something that was very interesting because that turned out was good content, a lot of the time. It was reference material, but it was a pretty good signal to noise filter. \n\nAnd PG was like, \u201cWell, what if you just improved upon this and find a way to get people to submit links they think are interesting?\u201d And I\u2019m thinking back to this forum and I\u2019m like, yeah, okay, this could work. Cool. All right, yeah, sure, we\u2019ll take your money. (Laughter.) \n\nAnd to PG\u2019s credit, he was like, \u201cJust build a front page of the Internet.\u201d That was his mandate, and it was a good slogan and gave us a check. (Laughter.) He handed me this check for $12,000 and I\u2019m just, like, awestruck. I\u2019m like, my God, I can\u2019t lose this. I\u2019ve got to get this to the bank immediately. And we flew back to Virginia and got started on Reddit.\n\nAnd shout out, Alderman Library. That is the place where I came up with the name, registered the domain name. I hoped people would say, \u201cI read it on\u201d Reddit. I don\u2019t think anyone to date has, but that was the dream.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s awesome. So let\u2019s just jump ahead to what you\u2019re doing today. So, you have this fund called 776, and you\u2019re doing a bunch of interesting stuff under this umbrella, and I\u2019d love to talk about a bunch of it. So, there\u2019s the funding entrepreneurs. There is the incubating companies. And then you\u2019ve done something super interesting just over the past couple of weeks, I think, which is this Titan Fund, where you are empowering other investors, sort of like the Sequoia Scout Fund, you know, on super steroids. \n\nSo, like, why do all of this stuff? Like, you\u2019ve already, like, been super successful on a bunch of dimensions. So, like, talk about 776 a little bit.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Dude, Kevin, I\u2019m very motivated. You know, two years ago now, so in the middle of 2020, in the wake of George Floyd, I\u2019m looking around and I\u2019m realizing, like, I have a responsibility to a little girl who\u2019s, at the time, I think she was two and a half, who is obviously Black \u2013 my wife is also Black \u2013 and who is going to have, I think, very hard questions for me when she gets older and she kind of looks back on a lot of the stuff over social media and the rise of that, the good and the bad. \n\n\nAnd, you know, right now, today, you know, still literally today, she thinks my job is pancake maker. (Laughter.) And  that\u2019s such a beautiful thing, right? You know, she thinks I make pancakes. That\u2019s  how I make a living. I mean, I make pretty good pancakes. I do, like, custom artwork and stuff. It\u2019s every Sunday.\n\nBut I realized, like, I have a chance right now to spend the rest of my working years doing something that I want to be great at and also in a way that really aligns with my own values, and just, frankly, makes her really proud. And I realized, you know, at a certain point, despite being the face of this company, the founder of this company, I was still one vote out of five on a board. \n\nAnd I just realized, you know what? I want to be aligned. I want to make sure everything I\u2019m doing feels right and I put myself in a position where I can just, if I have an opinion, a strong opinion about a way we should do something, that I can be able to do it. And the path to doing that was starting this firm, you know, in addition to resigning from the board and some other stuff.\n\nLike, you know, 776 is a\u2026 We really do like to think of it as a technology company that deploys venture capital. I want to do this job of investing ten times better, not only in the returns, but the way that we do it, the way we support our founders with money, with resources that they can use for everything from coaching to therapy to, you know, every  dollar that we invest in an early stage company, 2% of it is accessible. We set that aside in addition for the founders to use for whatever they need for their wellness, personal development. \n\nWe\u2019ve had founders, you know, they\u2019ve used it for a vacation. They\u2019ve used it for a babysitter so they and their partner can go out for a date night. We\u2019ll pay for the dinner, too. They\u2019ve used it for coaching. They\u2019ve used it for therapy. They\u2019ve used it for whatever they need because for an early stage investment, your founders are everything, right? Even though we are investing in the founders, we\u2019re really doubling-down on the company because those founders are going to be in a better position to be more successful, be more effective.\n\nAnd candidly, it\u2019s something I wish I had had. When we started Reddit, two months into it, my then-girlfriend had a pretty serious accident, was in a coma for about five months. I spent a lot of time with her. She recovered, thankfully, fully from it. And a few months after that, you know, my mom was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. \n\nAnd so, in the first six months of Reddit, as a first-time CEO, as like a dumb kid right out of college, my entire world is turned upside down. You know, we had raised \u2013 this was a very different time \u2013 we had raised 60, six, zero, thousand dollars at YC demo day. So, we had a total of $72,000 in the bank. (Laughter.) And yeah, our burn rate was low. It was just two dudes sharing an apartment, but even the smallest expense felt like it was \u2013 it was massive, right? And so, all you\u2019re doing is trying to keep burn low. \n\nAnd so, now, I\u2019m looking at \u2013 and we\u2019re not paying ourselves a salary. So, I\u2019m looking at AirTran flights back to Baltimore to see my mom, from Boston. And it\u2019s, you know, probably a couple of hundred dollars. And I\u2019m like, gosh, do I really need to take this trip? Like, yes, okay, I need to take this trip, right? I can \u2013 I can take a few of these and sort of justify.\n\nAnd it\u2019s like just to have known \u2013 this is not to slight Y Combinator. This was the first batch; they were figuring out what they were doing. But now, with the benefit of hindsight, I can look at this and say, all right, like what a difference it would have made to know that there was money sitting aside that I could use and take those trips home, and not have to worry about our burn being hurt by it, and just not even have to have that little extra bit of trauma of like, well, jeez, what do I pick, spending time with my dying mother or spending time here with the company and not wasting this money? \n\nAnd so, that\u2019s the benefit now, having gotten a few gray hairs and seen a few things. You know, we\u2019re trying to do it even better. And again, it\u2019s not just because it feels good, even though it does. It\u2019s because I think it actually will generate more returns. And that\u2019s exciting because we want to be doing stuff that is sort of pushing \u2013 pushing the whole industry forward, I hope, because if we have success doing it, it will force everyone else to do it simply because it becomes table stakes to get the best founders.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I think it\u2019s so awesome that you\u2019re doing that. Like, having done a startup myself, there\u2019s really not much that prepares you for it. Like, you go in, and relative to what you need to know to be successful, like, you know nothing. Like, you\u2019re doing all of this stuff for the first time. \n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Nothing. (Laughter.)\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: You\u2019re, you have this incredible sense of urgency. Like, if you find any success, like all of a sudden, things are moving almost faster than you can handle. Like, you have a life that\u2019s going on outside of it. You have all of this expectation. So, investors give you money and employees trust you with their career. \n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Trust you with their future. Yeah!\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Your users, like, start loving your product. And like, nobody\u2019s there to, you know, unless you are lucky enough to find good mentors or to, like, have investors like you who actually care about the whole person like, you\u2019re just sort of winging it, man.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Yeah, yeah. And to your point, that\u2019s part of the \u2013 I mean, look, that\u2019s part of the magic, right? So, this is why I\u2019ll always have so much respect for the builders, for the creators, for the founders, because, like, having been on that journey. It\u2019s an irrational way to make a living. It\u2019s an irrational way to make money. Like, don\u2019t start a startup for any of those reasons. Like, start a startup because you just can\u2019t imagine doing anything else, because to your point, it is \u2013 it never leaves you, right? You\u2019re never clocking out.\n\nFor so many founders, it becomes such a part of their identity. And so, now you\u2019re talking about something that is \u2013 like, it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s multiple people, it\u2019s software, it\u2019s customers. It\u2019s all this other stuff. It\u2019s not you, but yet it\u2019s inextricably a part of you. And its failures are your failures, and they feel ten times worse \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 because our, you know, whatever, monkey brains just process pain worse than we do success. \n\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful thing. It is an absolutely beautiful thing when it works, but it comes with a ton of trauma, even if things, you know, quote unquote, go well because there\u2019s no such thing as an overnight success. And even the companies that you see being wildly successful had plenty of nights where there was no sleep, where you\u2019re suffering because you just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to work out. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, so I \u2013 I think it\u2019s incredibly awesome that you\u2019re trying to innovate in ways to help founders, like, be complete human beings. Like, that\u2019s just awesome. \n\nALEXIS OHANIAN:  I want better stuff. I think we all do, and I especially feel like\u2026 So, this generation of founder, the Gen Z, they\u2019ve grown up in the shadow of social media. So, they\u2019re a lot smarter, like I said, than I was because they\u2019ve seen the good, they\u2019ve seen the bad. They\u2019re more \u2013 I think they\u2019re a lot more thoughtful. They\u2019re playing a longer term game than we were because they\u2019ve seen, you know, 15 years of the first startup boom. \n\nAnd \u2013 but my biggest concern is I do see this sort of nihilism. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s cynicism. Like, there is also a vein of like, well, why bother? Like, the earth is screwed, right? Everything\u2019s going to hell in a handbasket. And yes, we have huge, huge problems that we need to solve. But the part I think is so important, especially right now and for this coming decade, is to make sure that we have people building to solve problems, and we\u2019re supporting those people who are building to solve problems, because, yeah, we have some huge problems we need to solve. \n\nBut the only way we will solve them, the only way we will improve things is by building, is by creating, is by doing. And I want to see that culture win. I don\u2019t want to see the culture of nihilism and, like, well, to hell with it win, because we don\u2019t get better stuff from that, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: And I mean, similarly, we just announced \u2013 so, I just funded the first $20 million of a foundation that I very creatively named 776 Foundation that I started for basically our version of a \u2013 well, similar to a Thiel Fellowship where telling college students 18 to 23, if you have a big swing idea, like a big, hairy audacious idea for climate in particular, you should apply. We\u2019ll give you 100 grand, take a couple of years, bring you into our network, etcetera, etcetera.\n\nAnd, like, I know this is an existential threat. I know it disproportionately affects communities of color, marginalized communities broadly. So, like, let\u2019s get as many of the best and brightest from all over the world to be part of this cohort. And we\u2019ll just give you money, resources, network support and just see what the hell you can come up with, because I \u2013 you know, every time I see a TikTok video go viral of some kid who\u2019s just depressed about the state of things and, you know, doesn\u2019t want to have any children or doesn\u2019t want all \u2013 like, that\u2019s not the energy that\u2019s going to help us solve this. \n\nIt\u2019s going to be the folks who inspire us and make us go like, oh my God, how did you figure out a way to capture carbon and do this thing, or how did you create this movement that accomplished this goal? Like, that\u2019s what we need.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I could not agree with you more strongly. And like, I mean, you as a historian should appreciate this. Like, technology has always been the instrument that we use to create the future that we want, you know, and like, inspiring that impulse to, like, figure out how to take the things that we know how to do, how to, just sort of jump off cliffs and try to invent things that we don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to work yet, like really is the way that you shape the future.\n\nAnd the \u2013 defining who the \u201cwe\u201d is who is doing all of that stuff is also super important. Like, it can\u2019t just be a bunch of tech companies, and venture capitalists and urban innovation centers in the coastal United States. Like, you know, you have to have \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: A whole bunch of people feeling inspired to go create this future. \n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: And shout out. You all are going to be carbon negative by 2030? Is that what I saw?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, that is our goal. I think \u201830 we\u2019ve got multiple milestones in there, so, and like, we\u2019re thinking about our emissions comprehensively, like everything from the carbon emissions that come from datacenter energy consumption all the way out to the emissions that come from running your PC. \n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Wow.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, we\u2019ve got a complicated set of goals. And like, it\u2019s going to require us going out and inventing a whole bunch of technology. And like, honestly, it\u2019s going to require that a whole bunch of these kids that you\u2019re funding right now create some innovative stuff, because there isn\u2019t a way that we\u2019re going to achieve our climate goals through energy abstinence. Like, that just isn\u2019t going to work. So, like, we\u2019ve got to make things way more efficient and we\u2019ve got to figure out how to get carbon out of the atmosphere. And we\u2019ve got to\u2026 I mean, like, there\u2019s a whole bunch of technological push we\u2019ve got to have.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Yeah. like, and this is where I know I\u2019m high on this drug because I get to enjoy it every day, because all I do is talk to founders and CEOs, whether I\u2019m hearing their pitch or whether we\u2019re working because we funded them. Like, there really is not a day that goes by where I don\u2019t leave a conversation feeling a little bit more motivated, a little bit more inspired, a little bit more curious. And I wish I could inject this in the veins of everyone \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Because, gosh, like, we don\u2019t have a choice. We have \u2013 to your point, we have to innovate our way out of this. And I love that. It\u2019s not energy abstinence that\u2019s going to do it, it\u2019s technology that\u2019s going to help us.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, and look, this thing that you just described, I think you even mentioned it before, like, we \u2013 there\u2019s a psychological result out there. I\u2019m sort of forgetting the paper and the author. But yeah, we react some multiple, like three or four times more intensely to pessimism and negativity than we do to optimism and positivity, which means you\u2019ve got to have a lot of optimism and positivity to overcome the pessimist. \n\nAnd like, it\u2019s not to say that the pessimism isn\u2019t unwarranted. Like, there\u2019s \u2013 you know, like I \u2013 I\u2019m a short-term pessimist all the time. I\u2019m an engineer. Like, you have to \u2013 you have to \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 to be an engineer, you have to be pessimistic.\n\nBecause you just sort of look at all the broken crap that\u2019s around you. And like, the idea is you\u2019ve got to go fix it. (Laughter.) But like, you also have to be, like, long-term optimistic. Otherwise, what\u2019s the point? And I am super long-term optimistic.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Like, why bother? Yeah, we\u2019ve got to be, and this is \u2013 you know, it\u2019s not going to come without a ton of hard work, but we have to be.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Otherwise, like you said, what\u2019s the point, man?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: We are \u2013 I think we\u2019re past time, but I have one more question I wanted to ask you, if you had a second.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Please.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So you obviously are just involved in a ton of stuff, and you\u2019ve got a wife and kid, so like, you know, lots of demands on your time. I am curious, amid all of these things that you could choose to spend your time on, like what do you do for fun or, like, in your spare time, if you have any?\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: That is the one that gets sacrificed. It\u2019s like, right, career, family and friends, I think is what I was told when I was getting married. And \u2013 and career and family definitely are crushing it right now. You know, actually and this is not \u2013 this is going to sound like a shameless plug. AOE4 is the one I\u2019d say there\u2019s like maybe an hour a week where my buddies and I will get on Discord. We\u2019ll play. I\u2019ll occasionally watch some highlights on YouTube, but \u2013 but that\u2019s mymy pure Alexis time, is AOE4.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Which is great because I do \u2013 look, I get a lot of satisfaction. Most of my childhood friends, we\u2019re all parents now, so we\u2019ve all had to recalibrate except for, like, one of them, who\u2019s probably never going to have kids and just always play video games and smoke weed, which is, you know, that\u2019s his lifestyle choice. He\u2019s great \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 but we find these little moments, and  I\u2019ve just found the best part of becoming a father has been really, and this is the thing I wish I could pop \u2013 I should popularize more with this whole business dad thing. It\u2019s actually made me better at work because it has forced me to really prioritize my time and be way more regimented.\n\nNow, the downside is my calendar is just absurd in terms of, like, I will block everything. I\u2019m switching over to something we\u2019re building internally. I used to use a freelancer time tracking app to log my time during the day so that I could see at the end of the week how I was spending my time. Like, how much time that I spend in internal meetings? How much time did I spend literally for family time? This is how unromantic. (Laughter.)\n\nSo, I\u2019d wake up on a Sunday morning and be like, \u201cGood morning, babe,\u201d and roll over \u2013 Olympia\u2019s running in the room \u2013 and then open the app and start the family time timer just so that I could understand, like, how much time am I allocating to the things that I care most about, my family and work? And you know, everything is always out of flux. It\u2019s either one or the other and trying to balance. And then, like I said, an hour a week or so for AOE, and that\u2019s my fun time. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That's awesome. \n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: It\u2019s good, really. I\u2019m a holy Roman Empire player. I feel like, you know, I could use a few buffs here and there. I feel like we need some more late game support, but that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not going to use this podcast as a soapbox for my Age of Empires requests. (Laughter.) I'm just going to put it out there.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter.) All right. Well, we will let it be out there for sure. (Laughter.)\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Okay, good. (Laughter.)\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome. Well, this was such a great conversation. Thank you for choosing to carve out a brick of your time to chat with us today. It was great.\n\nALEXIS OHANIAN: Of course. My pleasure, Kevin. My pleasure.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right. Well, that was Kevin\u2019s conversation with Alexis Ohanian. So, that was so fun. I really enjoyed hearing the two of you talk, and \u2013 and I know a bit more about Alexis\u2019 background and kind of his story than \u2013 than some of the other guests we\u2019ve had on the show, because I was around and doing some of the same things in those times. But it\u2019s just so interesting to think about, how kind of his interest in video games and websites and \u2013 and communities, online communities ultimately led him to \u2013o what he built at Reddit and now what he\u2019s doing at 776.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think the thing that Alexis really is extraordinary at is understanding community dynamics. I mean, it\u2019s sort of what Reddit is all about, and I think it\u2019s sort of what his venture capital firm is about. It\u2019s how he invests; it\u2019s how he thinks about promoting the next generation of entrepreneurs and tech founders. Like, it\u2019s really sort of an incredible world view or, like, point of view to, you know, focus all of your energy through.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, no, I couldn\u2019t agree more. And I think, yeah, community is such a core thing when you look at his \u2013 his career and also with what he\u2019s doing, going forward. And I do feel like it, like you said, I think it\u2019s a really great lens and frankly, a not common lens that we see a lot of times in tech. \n\nI\u2019m curious, you know, from your perspective, you mentioned at the top of the show, you know, that he was a history major and he talked about that. I wonder what kind of role \u2013 the type of person who has that sort of interesting look back at the past has, I guess, when you think about the lens of community and what you want to build, going forward.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I think it is so important. I mean,  we\u2019ve talked about this before on the podcast, but there are so many different ways to come into a career in the technology industry. It is not just say, like, hey, I learned how to program when I was ten years old and, like, got a computer science degree and was attached to a screen, 24-by-7 the first 25 years of my life. \n\nHe like just this really incredible proof point that you can have a really interesting worldview, like this whole idea he started when he was a kid, like being more excited about communities, and making things for communities and curating communities than code, although he wrote a bunch of code as well. And, like, coding is a good superpower to have in your repertoire. It\u2019s just not the ultimate superpower and it\u2019s not the only useful thing that you need to know to be successful. I think he demonstrates that really quite well.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, no, I think so. And I mean, what\u2019s interesting is that, at least like the way that I kind of gathered from your conversation, is that he said he saw code as a way to facilitate doing the other things he wanted to do, building communities, you know, having kind of those interactions rather than necessarily the end all, be all, which I think is really fascinating. I think it also makes for a really good founder and \u2013 and then, you know, a really good investor.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and to your point, like history is a really, really important teacher. I think people get confused about history sometimes, that it\u2019s sort of the memorization of a bunch of dates and names. Like, history is like, a really disciplined way of looking at what humans have accomplished and, like, what that tells us about what we\u2019re likely going to do in the future. \n\nAnd it\u2019s really I think a useful set of skills to have, like a way of thinking about the world that\u2019s really great if you\u2019re trying to make a company, and like, you want to have your company have a rich context that it\u2019s operating in, in society. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I think that\u2019s really true, and I also feel like, he\u2019s obviously, you know, mentoring the next generation, you know, Gen Z and what people are calling Web 3. But I feel like his experiences in Web 2.0 have to be, I would think, if I were in an upcoming founder\u2019s position, I would love to have someone like him with his experience and also his historical kind of ability, as you mentioned, to look back on context and place things in the right place. I would love to have someone like that as a mentor you know?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, for sure. You know, one of the last things that we talked about was the importance of trying to not just, you know, financially invest in these entrepreneurs, but to, like, really invest in, you know, encouraging people to be optimistic and to sort of use the lens of technology to look at the future and to believe that they can use these really powerful tools that we\u2019ve created to go solve the problems that are important to them. Like, that\u2019s such an important thing for folks to be doing for Gen Z and, you know, the younger generations that are going to come in behind them.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Absolutely. I couldn\u2019t agree more. I\u2019m really glad that we have people like him who are helping guide that through.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right. Well, that is all the time that we have for today. Thank you so much to Alexis Ohanian for spending time with us.
