{"episode": "EP-66 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Sal Khan", "text": "SAL KHAN: Let\u2019s make it so the teacher can see what the students are doing if they\u2019re under 18. Let\u2019s make it so our AI doesn\u2019t cheat, so that we can support students in, say, writing an essay, making the student do the work, but acting as an ethical writing coach. And if the student goes to ChatGPT or someplace else to get their essay written for them and brings it into our system, then our system, when it talks to the teacher, is going to say, well, you know, Kevin and I didn\u2019t work on this essay together. And by the way, it\u2019s not consistent with his other writing. We should double-click on whether Kevin really did this work. So I actually think the AI can actually be used to undermine AI cheating itself.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer and EVP of AI at Microsoft.  \nToday, tech is part of nearly every aspect of our lives. We\u2019re in the early days of an AI revolution promising to transform our lived experiences as much as any technology ever has. On this podcast, we\u2019ll talk with the folks behind that technology and explore the motivations, passion, and curiosity driving them to create the tech shaping our world. Let\u2019s get started.\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m co-host Christina Warren, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub.\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott.\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And I\u2019m super, super excited for our interview today. We are going to be talking with Sal Khan, who is the founder and CEO of Khan Academy, and he\u2019s a major leader in education access. He just published a book called Brave New Words: How AI Will Revolutionize Education and Why That\u2019s a Good Thing.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, you know, Sal is one of my favorite entrepreneurs. You know, and like, I don\u2019t even know whether Sal would characterize himself as an entrepreneur, like, you know, maybe more as a, you know, educator, you know, someone who really, really cares about equity and, you know, the overall social good. \nBut like, he has, as an entrepreneur, done this extraordinary thing, which is over the course of, I guess, like it\u2019s got to be close to 20 years at this point, really building this amazing education brand, Khan Academy, and, like, doing really incredible work to try to get high quality education into the hands of every learner in the world who wants access to it. \n\nAnd you know, like I think about, you know, growing up as a kid in rural central Virginia and, you know, like, I had this real thirst for knowledge, and it was a real struggle to get your hands on it, you know, back in the 1970s and early \u201880s. And, you know, I just think about all of the kids in the world who have been benefited by Khan Academy, and it\u2019s just tremendous, you know, thinking about the positive impact that has had.\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I completely agree. I remember when I first heard about Khan Academy and, you know, I was kind of \u2013 I think I was probably kind of skeptical about the idea, right? Like, okay, well, how good could this be? And then you, you know, looked at the content and started to meet people who worked there and who were instructors and also meet people who learned things from it. \nAnd just from my own perspective, this was before I even moved into tech, I was so impressed, as you said, because A) the ambition is huge, but I think B) even more importantly, it\u2019s one of those rare cases where you see something that has really achieved a lot of what it set out to achieve and in providing access to everyone. \nAnd it\u2019s great that the situation that you had when you were a kid is not the case for kids today, right, that because of technology and access and because of people like Sal, more of that is available than ever. So I\u2019m really looking forward to this conversation between the two of you. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, for sure.\n[MUSIC]\nKEVIN SCOTT: Sal Khan is the founder and CEO of Khan Academy, a nonprofit educational organization that offers free lessons in math, science, humanities, and SAT prep, as well as tools for parents, teachers and districts to track student progress. He holds three degrees from MIT and an MBA from Harvard Business School. \nToday, Khan Academy has more than 165 million registered users, is used in more than 190 countries, and is available in over 50 languages. Last year, Khan Academy launched Khanmigo, an AI-powered personal tutor and teaching assistant powered by GPT-4. This school year, 65,000 students and teachers piloted Khanmigo across school districts in the U.S. Sal, thank you so much for joining us today.\nSAL KHAN: Thanks for having me, Kevin.\nKEVIN SCOTT: So we always kick these episodes off by starting with people\u2019s early years. So when did you realize that you were interested in science and technology and engineering?\nSAL KHAN: Oh, it goes back a pretty far. The earliest memory I have, you know, I was always I liked Legos and I liked building stuff, and I had a fascination with transformers and cars and drawing robots all day. I remember even when I was very young, I used to, you know, in the \u201880s, they called us latchkey kids. You know, my mom would be at work and my sister and I would come on the school bus and, you know, we just watched the afternoon cartoons, and I remember just having stacks of pieces of paper, and I would draw some combination of bridges, cities, cars and robots. So maybe that was an early \u2013 I used to like to draw though, too. \nAnd then I remember when I was seven, my uncle doesn\u2019t remember this, but he was very young at the time, and we were living with them, and he was doing some math. And I said, oh, what is this? And he says, oh, this is calculus. \nAnd I\u2019m like, oh could you teach it to me? And he says, no, no, you know, you\u2019re only seven, you know, blah, blah, blah. I\u2019m like, oh, it looks interesting. What do you need this for? \nI remember this conversation clear. I remember it was like right in his bedroom. And he said, oh, well, you know, I want to be an engineer and this is really important. And I said, well, what do we engineers do? And he said, well, you know, everything around you an engineer had a influence on or built it and designed it. And I said, well, then I want to be an engineer. \nAnd then \u2013 he doesn\u2019t remember any of this. And he said, well, if you want to be an engineer, you should go to MIT. He just said that randomly in like, whatever, 1983 to me. I had no idea what it stood for, where it was. But I remember that\u2019s when it got into my head that that\u2019s where I wanted to go to school.\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s awesome. And you were seven?\nSAL KHAN: I was seven. I didn\u2019t know what I was thinking, but it kind of, you know, manifested itself then.\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s awesome. And so, other than your uncle, like were your parents engineers or mathematicians or scientists?\nSAL KHAN: No, not really, not at all. My \u2013 you know, my family had a little bit of a tough start in the \u2013 you know, it started very traditional. My dad had come in 1968. He was a physician, comes to New Orleans, does his residency at Charity hospital. 1971 he goes back to Bengal to get an arranged marriage to my mother. They come, \u201872. They have my sister \u2013 sorry, \u201873 they have my sister and then \u201876 they have me, and then they get divorced. And, you know, so he\u2019s kind of out of the picture. \nAnd so, my mom was not into math or science at all. You know, I had this one uncle that  you know, he was probably the only person in the family that was all \u2013 at all inclined in this direction.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, it\u2019s one of the interesting things \u2013 theme across all of these conversations that we\u2019ve had on the podcast over the years that like the power that those influential people in their lives have, you know, whether it\u2019s an uncle or a teacher. \nAnd, you know, I think, you know, I wonder, you know, part of the story that probably everyone knows about you at this point is like you started Khan Academy because you had like a younger relative who was looking for some help with math tutoring, and I, like, wonder how much your impulse to help him would have been different if you hadn\u2019t had that seminal moment with your uncle when you were young.\nSAL KHAN: Yeah. You know, you never know. I think that was probably most influenced, if I have to guess, you know, and I forgot this, but some classmates from college, they had some time capsule from our dorm, and they just unearthed it. And I didn\u2019t realize, but I guess I was talking about education even then, because I predicted about myself and some people independently predicted about me that Sal will have started a school because he\u2019s always talking about that there\u2019s a better way to teach people. So apparently I was talking about that in the \u201890s.\nAnd if I were to trace the roots of that, if you go all the way back to high school, I was maybe not a surprise to a lot of folks, the president of the math club. And we used to run these tutoring sessions, and they became pretty large scale, and the school actually made them a formal part of the school, where any student in our high school who had a C or lower in their math class had to go to this student-run tutoring that I ran with the other members of the math club. \nAnd I remember seeing that, that just when I was able to give one-on-one tutoring or some of my other peers were able to give one-on-one tutoring to some of these students, most of them started racing ahead. Some of them joined the math club, even though they were, you know, a few weeks before, about to fail. \nAnd so, that only reinforced my belief that, like, maybe there\u2019s a better way of doing things. And so, I \u2013 even when, you know, it was my fianc\u00e9e at the time, and then my now wife, she used to sometimes complain like, you know, I\u2019ll \u2013 people like you, you have such this education, you have this passion for learning, but you\u2019re working at a hedge fund; how are you helping people? How are you? \nAnd I always used to tell her, I was like, well, I\u2019m going to do this as long as I enjoy the hedge fund job, it\u2019s intellectually interesting, but I\u2019m going to do this until I can afford to start a school on my own terms. That was what I used to tell myself as my way of giving back. \nSo it was always in the back of my mind. So when my cousin needed help, or at least I thought she needed help, I a little part of me wanted to help her, and another part of me wanted to start testing some of these ideas that I had kind of tested in the past to see if it would work again.\nKEVIN SCOTT: But I want to go back to your like, high school math tutoring experience. So, like, this is super, super interesting to me. So when I was a PhD student, I taught computer science to college kids. So I was the TA for, you know, University of Virginia\u2019s sophomore computer science course. Like, I taught a graduate seminar, and, like, I was an instructor at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, and, like, taught a couple of classes there. \n\nTeaching is really hard, like really, really difficult. And I think, you know, folks in engineering and science, like we don\u2019t always do a great job preparing teachers for teaching, you know, those materials.\nAnd part of what makes it hard is like it\u2019s really different teaching, you know, like a super, highly motivated, super well prepared A student versus, you know, a C student. And like, it\u2019s not because one is smarter than the other. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s just a different bag of tools that you have to go deploy to, like, get someone to learn the way they need to learn.\nLike, how on God\u2019s earth did \u2013 and, you know, sometimes, like the harder thing is like not teaching the A student; it\u2019s teaching the C student. So how did you figure this out when you were a high school student? Like that seems extraordinary. \nSAL KHAN: Well, you know, who knows? Who knows how good I may or may not have been. But if you think about it, I think to become a really good tutor, and it\u2019s a little bit different if you\u2019re running a large class versus tutoring, but there\u2019s really two skills ideally that you have, and they\u2019re somewhat orthogonal. And that\u2019s maybe why some \u2013 you know, you don\u2019t see maybe them happening in combination a lot. \nOne is I think it\u2019s super important that you know the subject matter, like, you know, forwards and backwards, that you\u2019re excited about it, that you have a conceptually deep understanding. \nAnd then the other one is that you have a good sense of modeling what\u2019s going on in the other person\u2019s mind. It\u2019s called almost like a intellectual empathy, I guess you could call it. And those are two different things. \nAnd you know, I think especially when you go into some math topics, you oftentimes might \u2013 well, you know, sometimes there are people who are really good at one, like they\u2019re really good at the pedagogy and the modeling and the empathy, but they don\u2019t have, to your point, like a PhD level of the understanding of the math, etcetera, etcetera.\nAnd so, there\u2019s only so far they could go in like saying why this is cool or how it connects to other things, or why this formula is really just a repackaging of this other formula. \nSo I think, you know, for just random flukes of I was the kid growing up, I\u2019m sure you were too, that when a formula was given, you\u2019re like, well, why does that make sense? Let me prove it to myself.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\nSAL KHAN: You know, wait, that seems pretty similar to this other formula I saw in my chemistry class. Is that the same formula? You know, PV = nRT, why does that make sense? Instead of just me memorizing, oh, it makes a ton of sense. Like, why don\u2019t they just tell us that? It\u2019s just, you know, pressure times volume is going to be the number of molecules times some constant times the \u2013 like okay, that makes intuitive sense to me. \n\nSo I think you do that, and at the same time, you, you know, try your best to listen and empathize and understand what\u2019s going on in someone else\u2019s mind. And you have a good shot.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, for me, like, I think you and I were probably like a little bit alike, at least. \nThe thing I will say, like, I was always pathologically contrary. So, like, I had this relatively narrow set of things that I just wanted to know everything possible to know about the things. And so, it was super easy, you know, like, you were just \u2013 you threw anything into that funnel and it was going to get digested. \nAnd then I had things that I wasn\u2019t interested in, and if you couldn\u2019t very clearly explain to me why the concept you were teaching me mattered, like what reason do I have for internalizing this? Like, I would just completely ignore it, you know. And so, like, I was super contrary about like, chemistry, for instance, which I wish I hadn\u2019t been.\nBut like, I do think it\u2019s really interesting to me, like, even watching my kids, like they learn differently than I learn. And so, like, figuring out how to adapt your teaching style to like this, you know, real diversity of learning styles that people have is it just seems hard.\nSAL KHAN: Yeah, although, you know, I\u2019ve obviously tutored many cousins, and, you know, now we have a school out here, and I\u2019m \u2013 I don\u2019t, you know, teach daily, but I observe a lot, and I\u2019m also a parent now. Yeah, I think the motivation one is definitely a big one. And I think especially with parent-child dynamics, there\u2019s all sorts of baggage that gets involved there.\nBut generally speaking, yes, for that student that you kind of described as like the C student, there\u2019s usually \u2013 and Nadia was in that category in 2004. There is a lot more foundation of rebuilding someone\u2019s confidence. \nI fundamentally think the reason why most people say, why do I have to learn this, this doesn\u2019t matter to me, it\u2019s really to protect their self-esteem. It\u2019s usually because there\u2019s something a little bit frustrating about that subject matter, and they\u2019re saying, well, I don\u2019t need to learn this anyway. \nBut, you know, like, you know, many of us, I used to enjoy playing basketball when I was in P.E., but I never said, why am I putting an orange ball through a hoop 10 foot in the air? You know, I\u2019m a five-foot-nine Indian kid. I don\u2019t see a lot of kids like me in the NBA. But I was interested because I could engage, even though I was, you know, usually the last or second to last person to be picked. So I think the same thing is true in most \u2013 in most topics, like, you know, kids disengage to protect their self-esteem.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I\u2019d love to get your perspective on this. So I think one of the common things that I see or have seen with the students that I\u2019ve taught over the years, and like the same is true with engineers, and I see it with my children, is it\u2019s very easy to believe that when you encounter something hard where you\u2019re not immediately good at the thing or you don\u2019t immediately, you know, just get it, that you can tell yourself a story that, oh, I\u2019m bad at this thing. And it\u2019s usually nonsense. \nLike, I saw it with my oldest daughter. Like, she, for reasons I just don\u2019t even understand, like the child is super bright, when she was in the fifth or sixth grade, she had, like, convinced herself that she wasn\u2019t good at math. And like, clearly it was incorrect. I mean, it was hard, because like, she was in advanced math classes and it was difficult and like, she had other things that she took that didn\u2019t seem as difficult to her, like that she learned more quickly. \nAnd now she\u2019s like, you know, two years ahead of grade level in advanced math, and like just super excited about it, and like, math is her favorite subject, math and, you know, chemistry.\nPart of that is like her just overcoming this story that she was telling herself that like, hey, I\u2019m not good at this and like, you know, flipping the narrative in her head. Like, I don\u2019t know, like how often you encounter this in the students that you teach.\nSAL KHAN: Yeah. I mean, that was going on for sure in Nadia\u2019s head, and she was about 12 years old at the time. And, you know, I\u2019ve read some research about this and it fits what I observe is that most people\u2019s identities or perceptions of themselves tends to start to become more rigid around middle school at age 10, 12 \u2013 well, more like 12, 13 years old. \nAnd unfortunately, I think for, you know, probably a lot of just societal, cultural reasons, you know, things associated with gender, whether or not it\u2019s true or not, a lot of young women, unfortunately, start to believe that about themselves, and I think sometimes people project that onto them. \nAnd you know, so I remember when I was first working with Nadia, a lot of that was exactly like, you know, even the most basic question that she clearly knew how to do, she would always answer it with a question. You know, it was like, what\u2019s two to the third power? Eight? I\u2019m like, are you sure? And then I just taught her to just have more conviction, to be more confident, to just be a little bit more like, okay, I\u2019m sure. Or if even, you know, I either know the answer, here it is, or I don\u2019t know the answer and just say that confidently, I don\u2019t know the answer; let\u2019s understand this. And that made a huge difference. \nAnd then when she started to see that as we worked and gave her more practice and she was able to fill in her gaps, and frankly, one of the things I did, and I find this is useful even with my own kids, when they \u2013 or all kids, when they\u2019re feeling underconfident, because the students who are struggling, they\u2019re always feeling like they\u2019re behind. It\u2019s very hard when you\u2019re always feeling like you\u2019re behind, is I teach them something that their peers haven\u2019t learned yet. \nSo I remember \u2013 I forgot what the subject was, but, you know, Nadia, she was learning unit conversion, etcetera, etcetera. She was struggling. But then I started teaching her a little bit of algebra. I taught her a little bit of negative exponents, which her class had not seen yet. And then that one, that actually came to her quite intuitively. \nAnd I said, you know, by the way, you\u2019re not even supposed to learn this till algebra two. And she\u2019s like, really? And I\u2019m like, yeah, like your classmates don\u2019t know this stuff yet. And that \u2013 that kind of changes. Okay, so maybe it\u2019s just the unit conversion, which was, you know, causing her to underestimate herself.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, that\u2019s super interesting. I did a similar thing with my kids. Like, my favorite thing to do with them, and I started this when they were really young, is like, I would drop little nuggets of number theory on them, just because it\u2019s beautiful, right? And like, you know, again, it\u2019s one of these subjects, you know, that most people, you know, like, they only take if they\u2019re a math major. And, you know, like they tell themselves, ah, this is hard. Like, I don\u2019t think number theory is hard at all, like and it\u2019s like one of the most beautiful branches of mathematics. \nAnd so, like, I would explain these things to my kids, and they would get them and then I would tell them it\u2019s like, yeah, you know, this is like junior level college math major stuff. And they would just be shocked that they got this thing that was like, quote/unquote advanced. \nAnd so, like, you know, it always made me wonder, like, you know, pedagogically with mathematics, like, you know, there\u2019s this routine that we run kids through and like, I don\u2019t necessarily know if it\u2019s even the right routine. \nLike, I \u2013 you know, just me, for instance, like I never loved analysis. So like, all of the calculus and, you know, complex numbers and like, I took it all, but like, it just wasn\u2019t my thing. Whereas like, all of the discrete math and like, I really didn\u2019t love differential equations until I took numerical optimization. And, you know, so like, if I can write programs about like calculus, like I love it, but like, if I\u2019m sitting down and, you know, trying to remember my integration formulas, like, I don\u2019t love it.\nBut I love, you know, graph theory and combinatorics and number theory and like, abstract algebra, and like, I just wish we had a richer repertoire that we, you know we gave, we opened up for kids, you know, because wherever you can find beauty in like, this abstract thinking I think is like, you just latch onto that and let people go.\nSAL KHAN: I couldn\u2019t agree more. Get people into it before \u2013 and I was just talking earlier today to our team about, you know, they asked about have I \u2013 is there some other countries that you\u2019ve observed that do things well?\n\nAnd you know, one realization that I didn\u2019t know going through the U.S. system, but the U.S. system has only gotten, I would say worse since you and I went through it, which is there\u2019s been a bloat of standards. \nAnd what happens, like you go into the minutiae of every possible way of, let\u2019s say, in seventh grade understanding proportional relationships. And you spend, you know, a month on every way with story problems, not story problems, tabular data, this and that. \nAnd so, one, it creates a lot of standards. You don\u2019t get this sense of progression. If proportional relationships isn\u2019t your thing, you\u2019re kind of stuck in that desert for a very long time where you could get discouraged. \nAnd I was talking to one of the teachers I know, and she was saying how in Russia they have about half the standards, and it\u2019s almost a strict subset of the U.S. standards. So it actually, one, it allows more people to master the concepts that they are learning. I talk a lot about in, you know, my various books and when I give talks, you can give people all these standards, but the reality is the majority of kids in America, when they go to college, these are the kids who graduate from high school and then go to college, they place into remedial math, which is essentially seventh grade math. \nSo what good were those hundreds of standards in algebra and geometry and pre-calc and calculus? No one was learning any of it. While in places like Russia, places like Singapore, they have a smaller set of standards, but they really make sure that people master those standards, and those students do a lot better on average. \nAnd it also gives you a sense of velocity. Like you\u2019re not in this, like, never-ending, we\u2019re just doing proportional relationships until, you know, for the next three months that you get to survey some things, some of which not only do you get a sense of progress, but use some of the things that you might take interest in, like you mentioned.\nIf I had my druthers, I absolutely would bring the beautiful stuff much faster into early \u2013 and I actually \u2013 even some of the algebra stuff could be very beautiful. And I\u2019ve seen, you know.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Very beautiful.\nSAL KHAN: Kindergartners can understand the idea of an unknown. Like, they have problems with blanks. And you just say, instead of using a blank, just use X, and like, oh. \nLike I did it with my own kids, or negative numbers, or, you know, even like, oh, i is the square root of negative one. That\u2019s wacky. Like, they love stuff like that. But we don\u2019t expose it to them. And but yeah, especially like things like number theory, etcetera, that gets really cool.\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s super cool, and yeah, just beautiful ways to explain the stuff as well. \n\nSo, anyway, let\u2019s go back to you in high school. So you obviously were, you know, a math enthusiast in high school. You\u2019re tutoring math. Like, your uncle planted this seed that, you know, you\u2019re going to go to MIT, which you took. When you got to MIT, like what did you decide to major in and why?\nSAL KHAN: Yeah, when I applied, I wanted to be a theoretical physicist. I was one of those kids, like I want to understand the big questions. You know, what is the nature of reality? \nAnd I\u2019m still interested in those big questions, but once I got there, you know, this was \u201894 that I started my freshman year, obviously computers were already a thing. I\u2019d luckily \u2013 when I was in high school, I took some dual enrollment courses at the University of New Orleans. And there was a professor, Dr. Santanilla, this was the summer before I went to MIT, he saw that my family, we couldn\u2019t afford a computer. And I was interested in computing. And so, he gave me a research fellowship, essentially so I could get access to his computers. He actually paid me a little bit, too. But that\u2019s the first time that I really had full access to, like, good, like, powerful computers. And I taught, you know, some more powerful programming techniques, etcetera. \nAnd so, by the time I got to college, I started to get really enamored with, well, instead of, you know, being a theoretical physicist and all of what that entails, what if I could \u2013 there were two areas of computing that were really interesting to me at the time, you know, this notion that you could create a reality versus just study a reality, and the idea of, you know, this very \u2013 perhaps even a bigger question than the nature of reality is the nature of consciousness or intelligence. And obviously, that\u2019s becoming a very big question even more so these days. But I got really interested in artificial intelligence back then. \nKEVIN SCOTT: And this is \u201894, you said?\nSAL KHAN: This is \u201894, \u201895. And so, I switched to be a computer science and math major. And I mean, it\u2019s almost both directions. I said, well, math is even purer than physics. Physics to some degree is based on our perceptions of things, although not fully. Obviously, at some point it just boils down to math, and, you know, we conceptualize it with our perceptions. And then \u2013 but I said, you know, computer science seems like a lot of interesting things in it these days.\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, you just mentioned, you know, something that sounded like computer graphics and virtual reality, and like you mentioned AI. So, like what in particular in computer science, like when you were an undergraduate and then, like, through the rest of your education, like where you really focused on? Like, what were you drawn to? \nSAL KHAN: I mean, just right at the beginning, I remember there was this like lottery system where you could pick your freshman advisor, and I saw who was there, and I saw that Henry Patrick Winston, who\u2019s head of the MIT AI laboratory at the time, and one of the his advisors was Marvin Minsky. And, you know, they were kind of like the founders of the field, to some degree, of AI. So I actually sought him out, and he was my freshman advisor. And he taught the class, you know, Intro to Artificial Intelligence. \n\nSo that was definitely that was a pretty big draw, but I was also really drawn to these ideas of, you know, that first summer after my freshman year, I got an internship at the Media Lab to kind of create, like an image processing library, which at the time, I thought was like, the coolest thing in the world. Obviously, we take all of this stuff for granted now. Our phones can, you know, edit images way better than anything we could have done back in 1995. But, you know, both of those were really interesting to me.\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, you\u2019re going through MIT. So like at some point, like you\u2019re having to think about like, all right, like I\u2019m getting this computer science degree, like, what am I going to go do with it? So, like, how did you think about managing your career?\nSAL KHAN: Yeah. And if I\u2019m honest, I probably looked kind of relaxed from the outside, but by the time junior, senior year came around, I was pretty angsty around this. Like, what am I going to do with my life? \nAnd on one side, there was definitely a financial consideration. You know, my mom, I remember filling out her taxes the year before I went to college to get financial aid, and she made like $16,000 a year. You know, she was essentially working, like, pretty, you know, hourly, you know, manager at a convenience store or cashier type of job. So I was like, it\u2019d be pretty irresponsible for me to, like, not help the family in some way. \nAnd, you know, but I did say, well, maybe I want to do a PhD, but I wasn\u2019t personally I used to tell people, if there was like a PhD in everything, that\u2019s the one I would want to do. Because, you realize that \u2013 or if there was one that was more focused on maybe education and less focused on \u2013 not education in the sense of you can get obviously a PhD in education, but one more focused on the learning of computer science or the learning of mathematics in particular, that could have been interesting.\nBut I was \u2013 and people will tell you, I thought I was going to be pre-law for a little bit. I thought I was going to go to med school for a little bit. I was an MCAT instructor for the Princeton Review in 1997. Like, I had no idea what I was going to do. \nAnd then I thought I was just going to stick around and get my masters. They had this like five-year program where you can just do another year. And this was 1997, \u201898, my senior year, and I learned of a few people who graduated the previous year who came out to Silicon Valley and, you know, were getting paid $70, $75,000 a year, which back then seemed like a ton, and which it actually was pretty good back then, in the late \u201890s. And I was like, wow, that\u2019s like five times what my mom is making. Maybe I should do that. \n\nSo I accelerated. I was like, oh, I could just jam some more courses in, in the next two terms, finish the masters, and then I applied out of cycle, and I ended up, you know, moving out to Silicon Valley to be a product manager at Oracle.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Nice. And how was that? Like, how did you \u2013 and like, that\u2019s an interesting time. Like, this is like internet boom. So it is all good times in \u201898 and like, the world is changing and everything\u2019s growing fast. So what was that like? \nSAL KHAN: Yeah, it was. It was. One, you know, it was a bit of a \u2013 if I\u2019m honest, a little bit of a culture shock going from a university environment to a large corporation, a large corporate environment. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yep. \nSAL KHAN: You know, things don\u2019t move quite as fast as you hope for them to move. There\u2019s a lot more of like getting buy-in, etcetera, etcetera. \nSo, you know, and at the same time, to your point, there was all this sexy stuff going on with startups, and people my age were, you know, becoming millionaires overnight, seemingly. \nSo yes, I lasted there about 13 months, and then I worked at one startup for three months, and then I ended up working at another startup for the next 13, 14 months until the NASDAQ collapsed. And then I said, maybe I should go to business school.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Which I think is what a lot of people did. Like, a ton of people who, like, went to B-School or went back to get their PhD when the stock market collapsed and the air went out of the bubble. I mean, did you enjoy B-School?\nSAL KHAN: Yeah, you know, it\u2019s fascinating because I think I was a little bit of an intellectual snob coming out of undergrad at a place like MIT, where, you know, they really pride themselves on like, you know, it\u2019s really intellectually intense and not everyone\u2019s going to make it type of thing. \nAnd, you know, you show up at business school, and they kind of \u2013 when I went there, there was no grades. They would grade you, but they\u2019d kind of tell you what you would have gotten, but everyone essentially will graduate. \nAnd, you know, I used to joke that MIT\u2019s motto was \u201cmens et manus,\u201d which means hand and mind or mind and hand. And I used to joke that Harvard Business School\u2019s motto should be mind and mouth, because \u2013 and I say that actually in a nice way, because the whole \u2013 everything is case based. They\u2019re like religious about case based. So it\u2019s all about talking. It\u2019s all about you show up and for three hours that day you\u2019re just talking to each other.\nAnd you know, coming from a more like intellectually, let\u2019s call it hardcore engineering environment, I\u2019m like, oh, what is this? This is easy. \n\nBut once I left there, I realized how much a lot of that stuck with me, that I remember a lot more of those conversations than I do \u2013 I can\u2019t even tell you all the courses I took in undergrad, much less what was in them, but I remember a lot of conversations. Even now in, you know, my job at Khan Academy, I \u2013 there\u2019s a moment, and I\u2019m like, oh, this is just like that one case I saw 20 years ago.\nSo I thought it was a great experience. And I like the way they did it. It was you know, I call it high school done right. Like, especially at HBS, it was everyone had assigned seats, it had mandatory attendance. There was actually even a little bit of an implicit dress code. Like, you don\u2019t dress like a typical college or grad student. You had to, like, show up and, you know, dress decently. The professors all wore, you know, suit and tie. \nLike it was \u2013 there\u2019s something about it that I kind of enjoyed. And it forces you to build a community. It forces you to interact with people that would have been otherwise different than you. \nYou know, I met and became very close friends with people who are very different than me, people who were, you know, Navy Seals. I did not know any Navy Seals. Now, I was becoming good friends with Navy Seals or, you know, people who are \u2013 you know, there was a gentleman in my section who was a Catholic priest. He ended up marrying performing the ceremony for my wife and I. I think it\u2019s the first time in world history that a Catholic priest married, you know, a Shia and Sunni, at least nominally. \nBut, you know, it\u2019s just that exposure and you know, being able to talk through a lot of scenarios was I actually thought it was a very \u2013 I really enjoyed the experience.\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, after B-School it was Wall Street?\nSAL KHAN: Yeah, I remember I was in this class the second year called Capital Markets. And once again, you know, B-School is not famous, especially HBS isn\u2019t known for being particularly quantitative. And capital markets was known as the most quantitative class that they had there. \nAnd I did become a little bit of a closer in that class, where the professor, who actually had a similar background, he \u2013 you know, his undergraduate was in engineering. He was a former engineer, and then he went and got a PhD in business. I remember his name, Professor George Chacko. \nAnd I remember one day after class, I went and I said, you know, Professor Chacko, I love this class. Like, what should I do with my life that does this? And he said, oh, you should work at a hedge fund. And I said, oh, that sounds good; what\u2019s a hedge fund? He explained it to me and a little bit was the financial. You know, I had another set of whatever, 100 and something thousand dollars of debt coming out of business school, on top of the $40 or $50,000 of debt of undergrad. And I learned that one could make decent money at a hedge fund. So I said, okay, I\u2019m going to work at a hedge fund. \n\nAnd then it was a horrible job market. This was, you know, 2003. And I probably got rejected 40 or 50 times by different \u2013 I had no background. My resume looked good to be a product manager at a tech company. My resume looked good to maybe even be a tech VC. My resume did not look good to be a hedge fund analyst. \nBut eventually this one guy, Dan Wohl, who was starting, he was just creating his fund. He was just one guy. He actually liked my resume because I had no background in finance. He was a little bit of a contrarian that, you know, he thinks the best investors are not thinking like all the other investors. So he gave me a shot.\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s awesome. And let\u2019s, you know, get to, you know, Khan Academy now. So like at some point, like you\u2019re doing this job for a little while. Like, you have this experience with your is it your niece or your cousin?\nSAL KHAN: Cousin. Cousin, yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Cousin. So you have this experience with your cousin. Like, how do you go from, like, a job on Wall Street to, like, wanting to do something that\u2019s very, very different. \nAnd like, you know, the thing that I will say to all of our listeners, like building businesses in education is really super hard. It, on the one hand, is like one of the most noble things that you could aspire to go do. And on the other hand, it is just an incredibly difficult market to be successful in. So you know, talk a little bit about that decision and like how it went in the early days. \nSAL KHAN: Yeah, you know it was 2004, a year out of business school, I\u2019d just gotten married, family from New Orleans was visiting me up in Boston, and I learned about Nadia needing help, or I thought she needed help. I tutor her remotely. That starts to work out. \nAs I often joke, I became a tiger cousin. I called up her school. I really think Nadia should be able to retake that placement exam that was putting her into a slower math track. They let her take it. She was then able to place into an advanced math track. I was hooked, I started tutoring her younger brothers. Word spreads in my family, free tutoring is going on. Before I know it, I\u2019m tutoring 10, 15 cousins, family, friends. \nAnd I was enjoying this, you know? And once again, this wasn\u2019t the first time we talked about me tutoring in high school and etcetera. But having a background in tech, and I think, you know, I\u2019m sure you do this all the time, you\u2019re always like, okay, I think I\u2019m adding value now. If only there were ways to scale or automate parts of this. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nSAL KHAN: And back then, I used to look for practice problems for my cousins, and there were random websites that had a few here or there but not a lot. And so, I said, well, I can create something that generates problems for my cousins, and a way for me to keep track of them so I can see how they\u2019re doing. So I created that. That was the first Khan Academy.\nAnd it\u2019s funny because after the \u2013 my experience at a startup in the late \u201890s, I had convinced myself, talk about talk tracks, that I am not an entrepreneur. I do not have the emotional fortitude to be an entrepreneur, especially a tech entrepreneur. \nAnd when I was building the software, a lot of my friends, especially my friends from business school, they\u2019d come to me and say, why are you working on this? How are you going to monetize this? What\u2019s the business model? \nAnd I didn\u2019t even want to answer their questions. I was like, nope, this is a family passion project. This is just a fun, little piece of software that I\u2019m making. Stop asking me questions about the business model. Stop being such a cynic!\nAnd then one of the friends said, well, this is cool, but how are you scaling your lessons? I said, I\u2019m not. He said, why don\u2019t you make them as YouTube videos? I said, that\u2019s a dumb idea. YouTube\u2019s for dogs on skateboards, cats playing piano. But I gave it a shot and my cousins famously told me they liked me better on YouTube than in person. So I kept going. And they liked the pause, the repeat. You know, I think hopefully they like me in person, but, you know, coaching them and mentoring them. But they liked the on-demand version. \nAnd so, I kept going, and still psychologically, I\u2019m saying this is just my hobby. My day job is the hedge fund; I enjoyed it. This is my hobby. One day, I might start a school or something, and maybe that school could leverage this software that I\u2019m making for my family. But I started. The more that I started getting feedback from my family, and then the more that other people started using it, discovering it on YouTube, or discovering the software, I naturally did say, well, maybe, maybe this could be for millions of people one day, billions of people one day. \nAnd if you fast forward to 2008, that\u2019s when I incorporated Khan Academy and I set it up as a nonprofit. And part of it was almost just to protect it from what I had seen, like the excesses of the dot-com boom and even my own mental. I was like, you know, this is a project that is \u2013 I don\u2019t care whether \u2013 how much money I make, as long as I can keep doing this thing. \nAnd I was thinking about all the people who were using it and getting value from it, and that they wouldn\u2019t have gotten value from it if I at some point tried to monetize them or do a freemium offering or something like that. Or at least that\u2019s how I thought about it. And so, yeah, I set it up nonprofit, mission: free world-class education for anyone, anywhere. \nAnd there\u2019s an irony here. In business school, the only class that I think I would have failed if they had grades was a class called Social Entrepreneurship, where I was super cynical about it. I was just like, you know, most of these nonprofits, it\u2019s more about PR. You know, I remember writing that, a whole essay about some, you know, bike ride that, you know, was to cure some disease. And I\u2019m like, is this really going to cure the disease? And I didn\u2019t realize that the professor had actually created that nonprofit. So anyway, that \u2013\nKEVIN SCOTT: Whoops.\nSAL KHAN: And, you know, now I actually see. Even if the money raised from that bike ride really isn\u2019t going to cure the disease, it does build awareness for the disease so I\u2019m much less of a cynic now than I used to be, but it\u2019s an irony that I am now a nonprofit founder. That\u2019s my life. \nBut and starting a nonprofit, just talking about starting a business, it\u2019s starting a nonprofit in any space is actually harder in many cases. If I wanted to be for-profit, I was living out in Silicon Valley at that point, there were VCs that were already coming to me as like, oh, I found your stuff pretty good. You know, I\u2019ll write a check right now; you can go start the business. It was tempting. There was no model, really, for a tech focused nonprofit. In fact, the few foundations I would talk to really didn\u2019t understand it well. \nBut anyway, I took the plunge in 2009, quit my day job because I frankly couldn\u2019t focus on anything else and tried to see if we could get at least some philanthropic support to get off the ground.\nKEVIN SCOTT: So. I mean, in retrospect, incredibly good decision. I mean, the amount of impact that Khan Academy has had on the educational system is really profound. \nBut I\u2019m just sort of wondering, like, how long did it take you to really realize that like, you know, this is going to be a really big deal in the world versus just, you know, being in the grind of like, oh my God, like, I gotta figure out how to raise money to, like, hire employees and, you know, like doing this as a nonprofit? Like, I can\u2019t issue equity to, you know, engineers like in the same. So like, I mean, it\u2019s sort of a \u2013 I\u2019m guessing it felt very challenging to go do.\nSAL KHAN: Yeah, that first year, I can laugh about it now, it makes for a good story. But it was \u2013 it sucked. It was \u2013 you know, I was \u2013 our first child had been born. My wife, who\u2019s a physician, was going through fellowship. So she was making a little bit of money. But we were living out here in Silicon Valley. We were renting a larger house. My mother-in-law had moved in, too, so we needed more space. And so, we were digging into our savings about 5,000 a month. Those savings were supposed to be for a down payment on a house, which as many folks know out here in Northern California, even in 2009, it was not an easy proposition. \nAnd four or five months into that, I literally wasn\u2019t sleeping. I was super stressed. I was crabby all the time. I was not in a good place, honestly, because of stress, Like, what have I done to my family? Like, I would look at my child and I\u2019m like, what have I done? Like, I gave up a \u2013 and, you know, even at dinner parties, if it was a venture-backed, like people kind of understood that in Silicon Valley. But it\u2019s like, well, you know, I started a nonprofit, and I\u2019m doing these videos, and people just give you a look like, this guy\u2019s the most irresponsible husband and father that I\u2019ve ever met. Like this guy is, you know, and you can tell when people are thinking that about you, and it doesn\u2019t feel good. Let me just say it, put it that way. But at the same \u2013 \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and like, and a bunch of people listening to this podcast may think that you\u2019re exaggerating, but like, I assure you, everyone, like you\u2019re not. Like, there is like, this very weird hierarchy thing that goes on in Silicon Valley, and like, it just does not make things easier at all.\nSAL KHAN: Oh, yeah. I mean, you notice. You know, a year ago, you went to HBS, you were working at a hedge fund. There\u2019s a certain energy you get from people where they\u2019re interested in you in certain ways. \nAll of a sudden, you\u2019re some guy making YouTube videos. And this was well before, you know, anyone knew about people making money on YouTube or any kind of celebrity of being on YouTube. And now you\u2019re popular if you\u2019re doing something on YouTube. But the \u2013 back then \u2013 and you\u2019re a husband and you\u2019re a father, and people look at you like you are an irresponsible person. I was telling myself, like, what have I done? \nYou know, and as I mentioned, I grew up with not a lot of resources. So, like, one of my things, I never wanted to be in this situation, especially my family, to be in the situation that we are, you know, we had to deal with the scarcity that I had to deal with when I was a kid. \nBut the only thing that kept me going, frankly, was, you know, my wife and I, we looked at our finances, okay, I can do this for maybe a year, max. And maybe I could go back if they\u2019ll take me. But I would also get these letters from people all over the world saying how it helped them. And that\u2019s the thing, I was like, well, this thing is scaling. There\u2019s people who are getting real benefit from it. \nAnd then it was about 10 months in that I started to get, I would say, like, real \u2013 and we got some national publicity. So that was a shot in the arm. It was, ironically, about the financial crisis, because I\u2019d made a bunch of videos about credit default swaps and mortgage backed securities. So they started putting me on national television to explain these things. \nBut it was in May of 2010 that we got our first real donation. It was $10,000 from Ann and John Doerr, a name some folks might recognize. And I had lunch with Ann, and she was shocked to find out that that was the largest donation. She was like, how are you supporting your family? And I was like, I\u2019m not. \nAnd then when I went home, I remember her texting me, you know, you really should support your family. I\u2019ve just wired you $100,000. And so, that was a huge \u2013 you know, obviously the money mattered. I could start paying myself a small salary, but the real, you know, Ann and John, you know, they are serious people who wouldn\u2019t just write a check willy-nilly. So that was a shot in the arm. \n\nAnd then you know, connecting it to your world, a couple of months later, I ran a little summer camp just because I was all \u2013 I never thought online learning is a replacement for physical; I always thought it was a complement. So I was running a physical, in-person summer camp. I was doing a stock market simulation with a bunch of middle schoolers. And I get text messages from Ann, which you can imagine I now take very seriously. And she wrote, \u201cI\u2019m at the Aspen Ideas Festival in the main pavilion, Bill Gates being interviewed by Walter Isaacson, Bill Gates talking about Khan Academy last five minutes.\u201d \nAnd I\u2019m like, what is this? And I boot the nearest seventh grader off of a computer. I actually was able to find the footage of Walter Isaacson interviewing Bill gates. Walter just randomly asks, \u201cBill, what are you excited about?\u201d Open question. And Bill says \u2013 and people can look up that video, Aspen Ideas Festival, Bill Gates, Khan Academy, you know, you\u2019ll find it. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yep.\nSAL KHAN: And Bill just says, \u201cWell, you know, there\u2019s a site called Khan Academy. I\u2019ve been using it with my kids. I\u2019ve been using it myself. There\u2019s this guy, Sal Khan. His wife let him quit his job. He creates these great videos.\u201d And I was like, what? Like Bill Gates is like, not only using it, he\u2019s actively using it. He\u2019s like a super user of this. He knows who I am. And that, I remember showing that video to my wife, and I was like, is this happening? Like, what do I do? Do I call him? How do I call him? Like, what\u2019s the protocol here? \nAnd then it was two weeks later. Larry, who\u2019s you know, runs Bill\u2019s office called, and you know, I was about to record a video. I see it\u2019s a Seattle number, like, hello, and it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, this is Larry, Larry Cohen. I work with Bill gates. You might have heard that he\u2019s a fan.\u201d I\u2019m like, yeah, I heard that. You know, we\u2019d love to fly you up in the next few weeks if you have a chance, to learn how we might work together. And I was looking at my calendar for the month, and it was completely blank. And I said, yeah, you know, I think I can make time to fly up and meet with Bill. \nAnd, you know, we had \u2013 obviously, you could imagine, it was an ultra-surreal experience for me. But that obviously, just the fact that a very serious person like Bill took this seriously and found value in it was a shot in the arm. \nAnd then obviously it was both the Gates Foundation and Google in the fall of 2010 that each gave on the order of about $2 million each over a two-year period to, you know, allow us to become a real organization.\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s really incredible, I mean, incredible that \u2013 startups have this in general, like, I call it, time on the runway. It just takes a while to get an idea fully baked and to, like, make your first version of your product and to launch it and to learn from it and get, you know, things into a state where they can be like a really scalable product. And like, you spent a while on the runway like, you know, in sort of harsh conditions. Like, I think it\u2019s like really, really amazing and commendable. \n\nSo, you know, once you had more resources, because I think the really extraordinary thing about Khan Academy is like, how effective you all have been at getting leverage, like, you know, using the assets that you had access to, to like, very effectively get more learning into the hands of more learners.\nAnd like, I do want to actually get to AI here in a minute, but, you know, 2010 is sort of, you know, well, well, well pre-Generative AI or even the beginnings of the deep learning boom that, you know, sort of happened in 2012 or so. \nSo like what were you using those resources to help scale back then?\nSAL KHAN: Yeah, you know, my view was, you know, I was able to see when I tutored my cousins \u2013 it really helped. Even going back to those high school tutoring sessions, that really helped. And so the idea is, could we use technology to scale up that type of personalization and mastery learning? I didn\u2019t have that word in my vocabulary at the time, but that\u2019s what we were doing, mastery learning, which was coined by Benjamin Bloom in 1984. It really is this notion of if you haven\u2019t learned something well yet, especially if it\u2019s something foundational, you should have the opportunity and the incentive to learn it well. It\u2019s that simple. And that\u2019s what a tutor can do. If you\u2019re a teacher with a class of 30, it\u2019s very hard, if Kevin has a gap, to stop the whole class to teach Kevin. \nSo the whole True North of Khan Academy has always been and continues to be, our mission is free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. The free, anyone, anywhere part, that speaks to scale, that speaks to low cost, you know, low marginal cost. \nBut then we \u2013 I intentionally, or at least subconsciously intentionally put that world class in there. I did not want that to be a tradeoff between low cost and scale and world class. And what does world class look like? Well, it\u2019s personalized. It meets you where you are. You know, I write in my book, Brave New Words, like Aristotle was the tutor of Alexander. That\u2019s what world class looks like; you have Aristotle as your tutor. And so the idea was always, could you approximate that and scale it and make the marginal cost close to zero, so that you can give it hopefully away for free?\nAnd we did that with videos and exercises and even early forms of AI with things like recommendations and teacher tools. We think teachers are a very important part of this ideally. Some places kids don\u2019t have teachers, so we still want to support them, but ideally the teacher is very involved in this.\nBut then obviously when we first saw, especially, you know, this is summer of 2022, OpenAI reaches out to us and shows us, you know, this is probably around the same time that you saw it. We were probably one of the few people in the, you know, world to see that level of generative AI, to see GPT-4 months before even ChatGPT existed. I was like, wow, this could get us that much further to this ideal of scalable world class.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So let\u2019s talk a little bit, you know, before we run out of time about, like, what your vision is for generative AI. And, like, you\u2019ve written you know, this book, Brave New Words. You know, people should go buy a copy. Like, it\u2019s a tremendously good book. \nBut, you know, I think one of the, you know, interesting things about Generative AI in education is some people\u2019s kneejerk reaction to it has been, oh, my God, like, this thing is bad, like let\u2019s get it out of the classrooms, it\u2019s just going to help students cheat. And like, you\u2019ve got a very different take on it, like, I think, you know, informed by all of the leverage work that you\u2019ve been trying to do over the years with the core of Khan Academy. So talk about that a little bit.\nSAL KHAN: Yeah, big picture, even broader than education, technology just amplifies human intent. And if your intent is to be evil, you will find ways to make the technology evil. If your intent is to be lazy, you\u2019ll find ways that technology can empower your laziness. But if you want to learn, or if you want to help people learn, there\u2019s always ways that technology can be valuable. You know, the same video technology that might, you know, have people watch not so great stuff, we can also use to teach them. And so, it\u2019s all about how do you mitigate the harms and maximize the benefits. \nAnd I tell everyone who is a well-intentioned person, just checking out and running the other way, that just means only the bad folks or the lazy folks are going to be using technology, especially now with these very powerful technologies like generative AI. \nAnd so, it\u2019s obvious things like teaching \u2013 cheating, and then, you know, there\u2019s issues sometimes with AI potentially around maybe bias, errors, hallucinations. What if students want to use it for unproductive ends, they want to, you know, help making a bomb or something like that or they want to harm themselves. \nSo what I told our team at Khan Academy is like, look, those aren\u2019t reasons not to work with Generative AI. Those are reasons to just put guardrails around it and turn those into features. Let\u2019s make it so the teacher can see what the students are doing if they\u2019re under 18. Let\u2019s make it so our AI doesn\u2019t cheat, but it can Socratically nudge you in the right direction. \nLet\u2019s make it so that we can support students in, say, writing an essay, making the student do the work, but acting as an ethical writing coach. And if the student goes to ChatGPT or someplace else to get their essay written for them and brings it into our system, then our system, when it talks to the teacher, is going to say, well, you know, Kevin and I didn\u2019t work on this essay together. And by the way, it\u2019s not consistent with his other writing. We should double-click on whether Kevin really did this work. So I actually think the AI can actually be used to undermine AI cheating itself. \n\nSo any tool can be used for good or for bad. And so, that\u2019s kind of like the big theme of the book. Here\u2019s all of the ways that it can be used well, here\u2019s all of the fears and risks that people have, but here\u2019s how we should mitigate those and actually turn them into benefits.\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, you know, maybe last couple of questions here. So what is your advice for people, as they\u2019re sort of thinking about maybe not even just AI, but like, you know, we have an interesting future headed our way because some technologies like AI are developing like really, really quickly. \nYou know, you have done a really tremendous job in your career using technology to, like, help yourself. You know, so like, computer sciences was your gateway into, you know, big Silicon Valley companies and startups and, like, eventually into, like, a hedge fund. Like, technology is sitting at the center of this nonprofit that you\u2019ve created, is having big impact. Like, what\u2019s your advice to people you know, for the future?\nSAL KHAN: You know, my advice is, and I write about this in the book, you know, there\u2019s people who think, \u201coh, well, the calculator exists, kids don\u2019t need to know arithmetic. Or computers exist, you know, it\u2019s one less thing that you have to learn how to do. The internet exists, search exists; you don\u2019t have to learn knowledge anymore.\u201d And now with AI, people are like, well, \u201cdo people even need to learn how to write?\u201d etcetera. But I always point out, if you look at any of these inflection points of technology, it has accrued the most benefit to the people with the deepest skills. \nAnd so, I think the answer is this is a reason to double down on, for sure, the traditional skills, the math, the reading and the writing, but also now augment that so that you learn how to creatively use these tools that can really amplify you, I mean, giving you almost godlike powers to do things that, you know, would have looked like science fiction even five, 10 years ago. \nSo \u2013 and I also write in the book, like this isn\u2019t like a nice-to-have. It\u2019s an imperative now because the status quo, unfortunately, most people aren\u2019t going to be in a position to leverage the AI because the AI is better than...you know, we\u2019re already seeing the AI is operating at the 80th percentile of the LSAT. Like, I would be worried if I was a 50th percentile lawyer\u2013 of where this is going. Now, if I\u2019m a 1 percentile lawyer, I know that there\u2019s certain things, yeah, the AI can help me draft a contract, etcetera, but I have certain expertise. I\u2019ve fought certain cases. I know the nuances that no AI can have. You\u2019re going to be superpowered. You\u2019re going to be able to get the AI to write your contracts. Maybe you\u2019ll hire fewer paralegals or whatever. But your expertise is going to be magnified even more. While if all you could do is draft a boilerplate contract, you\u2019re going to be in trouble. \nSo more people \u2013 I think, you know, the job market is going to broadly become kind of bipolar. The knowledge economy, if you want to be in the knowledge economy, and that\u2019s probably where the bulk of the value of AI is going to accrue, you need to upskill even more. And hopefully maybe you can use AI to help you get there, use Khanmigo, use, you know Khan Academy. \n\nI think there\u2019s also you know, people shouldn\u2019t panic. I think even if you can\u2019t be a 1% lawyer, I also think there\u2019s going to be a lot of, let\u2019s call it very human work, that as we have a more abundant society, we should have more resources so that we can have, you know, more caregivers, more people to fight loneliness, more people to, you know, provide help to the sick or to the elderly, whatever. So I think there\u2019s actually going to probably be work there, too.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Cool. Well, last question that I ask everyone is, you know, you have super interesting work that you\u2019re doing in your day job. Like, what do you do for fun? Like what, you know, what\u2019s your recreational activity?\nSAL KHAN: Some combination watching \u2013 you know, hanging out with the kids and the family, you know, dinner with the family and, you know, hiking. Maybe most people do not \u2013 might have a mixed view of whether this is fun or not but meditating. I always look forward to getting a good 20 or 30 minutes in. It tends to clear my mind. I always end up in a better mood after that.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And bonus question, like this really is the last one. So you mentioned like when you were a kid, like you spent a bunch of time drawing trucks and robots and, you know, like watching afternoon cartoons in the \u201880s. So what was your favorite afternoon cartoon?\nSAL KHAN: Oh, I mean, I think it\u2019s probably either Transformers or He-Man. I mean, the number of times that I\u2019ve stood on top of a table with a broomstick saying, \u201cI have the power,\u201d and, you know, hoping that something would happen to my body.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Excellent. All right. I think that\u2019s just as good a closing point as any. Thank you so much for being on the podcast today. And more importantly, thanks for doing the work that you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s just super important. \nSAL KHAN: Great. Thanks so much, Kevin\n[MUSIC]\nCHRISTINA WARREN: What a great conversation with Sal Khan. So, you know, kind of a \u2013 there were so many great aspects of that. I mean, I think kind of at the beginning, and you talked about this with him, but just the fact that \u2013 and you\u2019ve talked about this with other people over the years that we\u2019ve done this podcast, too \u2013 but as you said, kind of the importance of having that one person in your life who can kind of help unlock or put an idea in your head of maybe what\u2019s possible or what you can do, I think that can be so powerful. And I think that\u2019s especially powerful when we think about education. Do you want to talk more about that?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, I think we touched on it in a bunch of different ways in the conversation. So there\u2019s, you know, his uncle, who was obviously such a big influence on him, you know, both in terms of being that role model, like doing this interesting thing that, you know, that he was able to attach interest to when he was such a little kid, and like, also at the same time, who wasn\u2019t dismissive about like a seven-year-old\u2019s interest in this thing, you know, like nothing saying, you know, this isn\u2019t for you or this is too hard. It\u2019s just sort of patiently explaining things to him in the way that, you know, he can understand as a seven-year-old and then planting that seed that, you know, okay, well, you know, you want to be an engineer. You know, it\u2019s very easy to, like, look at a seven-year-old and laugh at that.\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like even well-intentioned people, like to hear what for the seven-year-old is a very earnest expression of interest and laugh at it, that can leave as much an indelible mark on how you think about yourself and your future as encouragement does. And so, he was lucky enough to get the encouragement. \nCHRISTINA WARREN: You\u2019re right.\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, like, I think that\u2019s just a beautiful gift to get and, you know, just to think about what he\u2019s created, it\u2019s almost like paying that forward to, you know, like \u2013\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes.\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 tens or hundreds of millions of kids in the world, you know, like Khan Academy is basically saying to like every child, it\u2019s like, this is not too hard for you. Like we\u2019re going \u2013\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes.\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 we\u2019re going to help you understand.\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I think you nailed it. I think you\u2019re right, it is kind of the perfect, you know, paying it forward gift, right, and I think it\u2019s a reminder, I think, for all of us not to immediately kind of diminish or dismiss, you know, a kid\u2019s earnestness or anyone\u2019s earnestness, but also to, you know, it\u2019s not too hard for you to understand. I think that\u2019s especially important, as we do move into, you know, new worlds with AI, to \u2013 to borrow the, the pun from his book.\nSpeaking about AI, which was part of the conversation towards the end of your conversation, one of the things that I was really impressed with about what he said was about how when we look at the power of these tools, and obviously there\u2019s a lot of concerns, and many of them are valid \u2013 and we need to be careful about how things are being used. But the fact is that throughout history, you know, these tools have accrued the most benefit for people who have the deepest skill sets. \n\nAnd him saying that I think is a way to reinforce the importance of learning basics and learning fundamentals and that, yes, just because we can do things faster and maybe we can do things at another level, doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t need those other skills, too. \nI thought that was really, really profound, and I think a really good way of framing how this is not an either/or situation. This is something where the people who \u2013 I\u2019ve seen this myself just in the last couple of years with Generative AI, where genuinely the people who get the most out of it are the people who are already very good at what the tool is being used for. \nAnd \u2013 but I really like that frame, and I really liked thinking about thinking this isn\u2019t a replacement. If anything, this is more of an opportunity for why you need those fundamentals and to get people excited about learning to begin with.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, 100%. I mean, look, this has been, as you pointed out, true for a very, very long time. And like, you can go back into the historical record and like, sample any other like technological revolution and like, you know, one of the things that\u2019s true about technology revolutions is people who lean into them, who try to learn as much as possible about them and try to unleash their imagination about how this technology could be used to do useful things for other people, like, really have tremendous benefits accrue to them. \nBy the same token, you know, folks who are hesitant and resistant and who like, try to shove the, you know, these breakthrough things into a bucket and, like, ignore them or make them go away, like sometimes are ones who, you know, struggle a little bit. \nAnd so, I think it\u2019s actually the way that he framed it is beautiful. Like, AI, if anything, means that there\u2019s even a bigger need for learning than there was before. It\u2019s not a thing that says, okay, well, like now this thing knows everything, and I don\u2019t have to learn anything because it\u2019s going to do all of my thinking for me. Like, no, no, no, no, like \u2013\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 not at all.\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, not even close. And in fact, it\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s like really to get the benefits, I think many times you really do need to have an interest and knowledge about what the AI is helping you with. \nI mean, obviously it\u2019s great if you\u2019re new at something, and it can be really useful in a learning context. But it just in terms of, you know, an automation context, it\u2019s that\u2019s going to be most useful for people who can really get the benefits of what that\u2019s doing. We\u2019ve talked about that before on this podcast, about kind of even opening up people to do \u2013 then solve, you know, harder problems or different problems. \n\nBut no, I really like that approach, and I look forward to \u2013 I ordered his book while your conversation was taking place. So, you know, everybody out there should just definitely be checking that out, because I think there\u2019s a lot of people who are very, I think, quickly to dismiss the role that AI can have in improving education, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily true.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, I\u2019ll tell the story here that I\u2019ve told I think on stage at our big developer conference when Sal was there with me. But my 15-year-old daughter is using the free version of ChatGPT to take these biochemistry papers that she otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to understand because she\u2019s in the ninth grade \u2013\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 dumping them into ChatGPT and then asking the AI to explain some of the concepts in there that she doesn\u2019t understand yet. \nAnd like, I have watched and pay very close attention to people who are trying to learn, both as a teacher and as someone who, like, hires a lot of people at a bunch of different, you know, stages of their career, where, you know, learning is very important to their job. And like, I have rarely seen such an acceleration in learning and, like, you know, just honestly, the fearlessness that it\u2019s given this kid that, like, she doesn\u2019t have these arbitrary barriers standing in between her and a thing that she\u2019s trying to understand. Like, you know, the AI doesn\u2019t make fun of her, like it doesn\u2019t tell her to go away when her questions are incessant, like it doesn\u2019t make her feel bad because she doesn\u2019t understand some jargon that she hasn\u2019t learned about yet.\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right. \nKEVIN SCOTT: And like, she just sort of feels empowered by it. \nAnd like, the thing that I tell to everyone is every student can have that because, like, she didn\u2019t ask anyone\u2019s permission to go do any of this. She signed up for the account. Like, the tool is free. \nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, all you need is an internet connection. And, like, granted, not everybody has an internet connection. \nCHRISTINA WARREN: Sure.\nKEVIN SCOTT: But if you have an internet connection and like, at least a, you know, mobile phone or a tablet, you know, you can do exactly the same type of learning acceleration as my 15-year-old daughter.\nAnd so, the thing that you really need is just awareness. And so, you know, and a willingness to go use these tools in an ambitious way. And so, like that\u2019s the encouragement I think I would go give everyone. It\u2019s like, just be curious about what\u2019s possible and like, let yourself use these things and see, you know, how they\u2019re going to help you.\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I think you nailed it. I was going to say curiosity, right, like having an awareness, having a curiosity and being willing to do that, I think you nailed it. And that can unlock so many things for so many different types of people, but especially for kids, especially \u2013 or for anyone who\u2019s learning. Let\u2019s not even limit it to kids, right? I think anyone who\u2019s wanting to learn anything, being able to kind of unlock that, and to your point, yeah, not have to be afraid, oh, will I be made fun of, am I asking this in a weird way, am I being annoying, I don\u2019t understand this enough, you know, do I \u2013 or, you know, what time in the world is it? Do I have someone who I can ask these things to, right? It\u2019s great to have access to that, and that can unlock other things. Okay, well, now that I know this, well, what about this other thing? And what could these two things do together? Unlocking curiosity, I think, is one of the \u2013 that\u2019s why people learn, right, is why people are continuing to go through that process. And anything we can do to lower those barriers, I think is great. \nAnd obviously, I think that aligns so super well with the work that the Khan Academy is doing and is going to continue to do. And I\u2019m grateful that people like Sal, you know, did all the work that he did and shifted his mindset to saying, okay, is there a better way and is there a more accessible way to start giving access to more people, you know, more content and more learning resources. And here we are, you know, like you said, almost 20 years later, and it\u2019s really fantastic to see. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \nCHRISTINA WARREN: Awesome.
