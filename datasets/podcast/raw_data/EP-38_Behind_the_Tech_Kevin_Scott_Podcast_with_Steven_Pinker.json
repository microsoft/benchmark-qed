{"episode": "EP-38 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Steven Pinker", "text": "STEVEN PINKER: It isn\u2019t as if this universe contains some force called progress. That\u2019s kind of mystical. In fact, if anything, the universe tries to grind us down. It\u2019s constantly throwing pandemics at us, and \u2013 and natural disasters and entropy, things wearing down, and falling apart and rotting. To the extent that life gets better, it\u2019s only because people have applied their ingenuity to try to make it better.\nWe\u2019ve invented antibiotics and vaccines, and intergovernmental organizations, and liberal democracies. Brain children that fight back against a pitiless cosmos, and allow us to increments of well-being. So, ultimately, rationality matters for ascertaining the good things in life.\n\n[MUSIC] \n\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone.  Welcome to Behind the Tech.  I'm your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we're going to get behind the tech.  We'll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did.  So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what's happening today.  Stick around.  \n\n\n[MUSIC] \n \nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello, and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Christina Warren, Senior Cloud Advocate at Microsoft.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Our guest on the show today is Steven Pinker. Steve is a cognitive psychologist. He\u2019s a psycholinguist and popular science writer, and he\u2019s authored 12 books, including his 2018 publication, Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, and I\u2019m  sure that you\u2019re super, super excited to talk about this, Kevin, his 2021 book, Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters.\n\nSo, given the world that we\u2019re living in today, these are very relevant topics to explore.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: They are, indeed, extremely relevant topics, and so I\u2019m super-excited to be chatting with Steven in general. I\u2019ve been an enormous fan of his work for the longest time. I remember reading his first book, The Language Instinct, when I was in graduate school, and I \u2013 I think I\u2019ve read every book that he\u2019s ever written. They\u2019ve had enormous influences on me because \u2013 you know, hopefully what we\u2019ll see in this conversation is he writes books that explain really complicated things to very wide audiences of people, but also in a way that gives them a toolkit for dealing with thinking about navigating the complicated things themselves, so it isn\u2019t just, say, like hey, let me explain this, you read it, done, walk away. Like, you walk away with tools that you can then use in your daily life, and let me tell you, we all need some tools for helping us deal with the balance between rationality and irrationality right now in 2021.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: We definitely do. We definitely do. So, I\u2019m super-excited to get into our conversation with Steven. \n\n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Our guest today is Steven Pinker. Steven is a psychologist and the Johnstone Professor of Psychology at Harvard. His research focuses on visual cognition, psycholinguistics and social relations. He\u2019s an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, a two-time Pulitzer Prize finalist and a recipient of nine honorary doctorates. He\u2019s a frequent contributor to the New York Times and The Guardian, and has authored 12 books, including his latest, published this September, Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters. Welcome to the show, Steven.\n\nSTEVEN PINKER: Thank you. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, we \u2013 we always start these conversations by digging a little bit into folks\u2019 background and you have such a distinguished career. I\u2019m \u2013 am interested in what your childhood was like and when it was that you knew that you were interested in science and a career in science?\n\nSTEVEN PINKER: I grew up in Montreal in \u2013 I\u2019m a baby boomer born at the peak of the baby boom in 1954. I was part of the Jewish minority within the English minority, within the French minority of Canada, so three times a minority, I suppose. It was a \u2013 I was always curious, a voracious reader, always interested in science, but I developed a \u2013 a particular interest in human nature, partly because when the \u201860s happened, and I \u2013 I was too young to be a direct participant in the campus unrest, but it was very much in the air, and there were older brothers and sisters who were part of the \u2013 the campus protests, and there were all kinds of ideas in the air. \n\nEvery \u2013 everything was up for grabs. How should we organize society? Should we be communists, should we be anarchists, should we be Ayn Rand objectivists, and all these debates kind of hinged on conceptions of human nature, are people naturally cooperative? And will they just share in the best interests of everyone so you don\u2019t need money or \u2013 and property and laws, or are people inherently violent, and so you need a police force within the country and armies to protect from \u2013 from outside threats.\n\nSo, human nature as the root of political philosophy was very much in the air. I had \u2013 my own family, we had \u2013 we had conversations around the \u2013 the dinner table \u2013 friends, and classmates were constantly in debate and argument. When I got into college, I wanted\nto study some aspect of human nature. I sampled the various disciplines, sociology, humanities, philosophy, biology. But psychology seemed to have \u2013 kind of was a sweet spot of raising profound questions about what makes us tick, but also offering some prospect of answering them with experimentation and data.\n\nAnd I was particularly excited by the cognitive revolution. Again, I was a little bit out of synch with the times, and it happened before I got to college, but still \u2013 still a bit ongoing, and that is the replacement of the behaviorism that had dominated psychology in the middle decades of the 20th century that made mental contents almost taboo. It was considered \u2013 under the behaviorist regime, it was considered unscientific to talk about memories, plans, rules, images, beliefs, desires. \n\nIf you were going to be a scientist, you could only study things that could be measured and that meant stimuli that impinged on an organism and the organism\u2019s responses. \n\nWell, that was kind overturned by \u2013 in part by the \u2013 the rise of computer science and the realization that here we have completely non-mystical, understandable devices, computers, you know, and they had plans and programs and memories and feedback loops and mechanisms that allowed them to be intelligent. Maybe that offered a set of conceptual tools where you could study the workings of the human mind, scientifically.\n\nSo, that was my intellectual odyssey. I majored in cognitive psychology, went on to graduate school in cognitive psychology and \u2013 and that has been the field I\u2019ve identified with, ever since.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, one of the really extraordinary things I think about what you have chosen  to do with your career is you\u2019re a \u2013 a prolific writer, and I \u2013 I think the first of your books that I read was The Language Instinct, and I \u2013 I \u2013 I think, at least in my opinion, you\u2019ve done this really incredible job combining ideas that hadn\u2019t been combined before and/or presenting very complicated things in ways that give people toolkits for thinking about a particular aspect of our lives and the world.\n\nAnd so, like the language instinct, I was just \u2013 yeah, I never thought about this idea that our psychology was an evolutionary process. I remember reading it as a computer science PhD student, and I was like, wow, this is a really interesting lens through which to think about psychological processes. And you\u2019ve written a whole bunch of other books that have influenced me in that way, so I \u2013 you know, I really enjoyed, The Sense of Style, which is a completely different book that tries to give folks a set of tools for, you know, dealing with this complex process of explaining things to other people and writing and finding a voice.\n\nAnd, and I think maybe with this new book that you\u2019ve written, like it might be the most needed book I\u2019ve seen in a very long while because not only does it go into this notion of, you know, what rationality and irrationality are, and like why we should want it, but it gives a very \u2013 what feels to me like a comprehensive set of tools that we can use for dealing with all these irrationality traps that we\u2019re faced with, right now.\n\nSo, I mean, just as a meta thing, how did you decide that you wanted to spend so much of your time writing these books, and like how did you find your \u2013 I don\u2019t know, your sort of voice and your approach to writing?\n\nSTEVEN PINKER: I always was receptive to feedback from the world, even before I started to write books for a wide audience, when I was confined within academia, and I had multiple lines of research going. I studied mental imagery and visual attention and shape recognition. At the same time, I studied how children acquired their first language, and \u2013 and psycholinguistics, and I just got a sense from the invitations that I got, the correspondence that I got, the reception of audiences, what did people find interesting, and where did I feel I was making a contribution? That is, doing something that other people were not, and that was one of the reasons why edged \u2013 gradually edged away  from visual cognition, just because there were many brilliant people in the field who were doing it better than I was, but what \u2013 whatever I was saying in trying to make sense of how kids learn to speak, people seem to find that interesting, and kept getting invitations for that, and \u2013 and I realized that that\u2019s where I had to devote my time.\n\nAnd while I was writing about language, with a focus on how children learn their mother tongue, right, you can\u2019t do that unless you have some idea of what a mother tongue is, so language development in children is intimately tied. Even though it was a branch of psychology, it was tied to linguistics because that\u2019s \u2013 tells you what it is they\u2019re acquiring. You know, you can\u2019t explain how kids learn something unless you know what it is they\u2019re trying to learn.\n\nAnd I \u2013 I sensed from people\u2019s curiosity about language \u2013 I mean, when I would be, you know, in a taxi or in a bar, and someone would say, oh, you know, what do you do for a living, I\u2019d say I study language and how children acquire it. And they\u2019d always say, oh, wow, that\u2019s really interesting, and they\u2019d have a question, why are there so many languages? Who gets to decide what\u2019s correct and incorrect grammar, how did language evolve, but I realized there was a \u2013 a need or at least a market, let me say, for the best explanation for the state of the art in understanding language, from \u2013 from a scientific point of view.\n\nAnd so, I wrote The Language Instinct, and it had chapters on language in the brain, the evolution of language, diversity of languages, correct grammar, kids\u2019 real-time speech processing, and \u2013 and then it got \u2013 to my surprise, because most academics when they cross over to a wide audience, their book just goes into the stores for six weeks and then it vanishes forever. \n\nThis one seemed to have an audience, and one thing led to another, so after having written a book that tried to tie together all the different aspects of language as a \u2013 a biological adaptation, an idea that I \u2013 I admit stealing from Charles Darwin, the natural question was, well, what are the other human instincts, if language is one of them? \n\nAnd that led to How the Mind Works, which is an exploration of everything else in the human mind, vision, memory, reasoning, concepts and categories, emotions, social relationships, humor, music and each one \u2013 I mean, it \u2013 having started out as a psychology major and being a cognitive psychologist, a lot of the topics were natural things to explain, particularly the chapter on vision, but an interest in evolution brought up all the topics that any biologist would ask about the organism that they study, but they aren\u2019t necessarily a major part of the social psychology curriculum, like \u2013 like mating and sex and violence, and so an interest \u2013 an evolutionary focus led to just those aspects of psychology that the whole world finds fascinating, even though they\u2019re not a major part of academic social psychology, and parts of How the Mind Works were on all of these kind of lurid aspects of human motivation and behavior.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s super interesting \u2013 I\u2019m a little bit curious. This may be a diversion from, you know, maybe the more important conversation that we should have today, but when you wrote The Language Instinct, it wasn\u2019t a foregone conclusion that it was going to be this success that it was. And having spent a little bit of time in academia myself, I\u2019ve \u2013 at least, in my part of academia, the academy doesn\u2019t necessarily value you writing popular science books. So, did you get a bunch of pressure from your peers that this was not a good use of your time? \n\nSTEVEN PINKER: I didn\u2019t. I wrote the book while I was at MIT, and they were perfectly happy with it. They \u2013 in fact, they would trot me out at alumni dinners and fundraising occasions as kind of the evening entertainment. It brought a lot of attention to the field, to the university, so they were just fine with it. \n\nNow there is \u2013 I was warned about the Sagan syndrome, referring to Carl Sagan, the charismatic astronomer who hosted the TV series, Cosmos, and appeared often on The Late Show with Johnny Carson \u2013 The Tonight Show, sorry, with Johnny Carson. He would appear in Parade magazine, the color supplement. It was tucked into Sunday newspapers when everyone read Sunday newspapers. So, he was a popularizer and he was denied election to the National Academy of Sciences, so the story goes, because his small-minded colleagues were jealous of his celebrity.\n\nNow, whether or not that was the reason, and I suspect it was, but I was warned, you know, if you ever want to get elected to the National Academy, this might be suicide. Anyway, I was elected to the National Academy years later, so it did not hurt me and neither MIT, where I spent the years when I wrote many of these books for a wide audience, nor Harvard, which I then moved to 18 years ago have \u2013 have had any problem with it. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, which is a really great thing because I \u2013 I think one of the \u2013 one of the things that I\u2019m often disappointed with is you have such a capable community of scientists and technologists who are working on the frontier of human knowledge and capability. And I don\u2019t think we spend enough time trying to explain the very complicated things that we do - to a wide audience. And I think that\u2019s one of the things that you\u2019ve just done incredibly well. And we should all be grateful that you have spent as much time as you have writing these things, because you could have had a perfectly reasonable and extremely distinguished career, never having written any of these books. \n\nSTEVEN PINKER: Yeah, I do feel that someone in our research communities should bear the responsibility of explaining what we do to the people who pay for it, the taxpayers, the intellectually curious people. And it is fascinating who isn\u2019t interested in how the mind works or in how language works. \n\nAnd so, traditionally, it\u2019s been journalists who will dip into a subject and explain it to a wide audience. And, you know, many journalists are brilliant people, deep thinkers, gifted apprentices, and they can master a field, but I think there is a role for people who are actually immersed in the field, who actually do the \u2013 some of the research, who attend the conferences, know the gossip, know the questions that are asked to \u2013 to try to put it together for a wide audience.\n\nNow, that does mean unlearning a lot of academic habits, not just writing defensively, like writing, hedging and fuzzing everything up so that, God forbid, no one can ever show you\u2019re wrong about anything. And that\u2019s what one of the big sins of academic writing, is that it is so defensive. The people \u2013 the main \u2013 I even, in my book on writing, The Sense of Style \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\n\nSTEVEN PINKER: I know that the \u2013 the first thing you\u2019ve got to do in writing anything is to have a model of the writing process. What are your goals? How do you imagine your audience? What is the fake conversational scenario that you are trying to simulate when people are \u2013 scanning a printed page? \n\nAnd for academics, the \u2013 and I got this from a wonderful book by Mark Turner and Francis-No\u00ebl Thomas called Clear and Simple is the Truth. They know that the model that academics write is to \u2013 it is a defense against any possible accusation or insinuation that they\u2019re naive about the methods and mores of their field. And that\u2019s how academics write. It\u2019s don\u2019t think that I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m naive, don\u2019t think that I\u2019m unaware of the possible criticisms and flaws, loopholes and exceptions. And that\u2019s one of the things that makes academic writing so turgid, and so \u2013 so wooly and bloated, is that no one ever says anything clear because they don\u2019t want to be convicted of naivete.\n\nWhereas the model that they explain and which I endorse, which they call classic style, is you\u2019ve seen something in the world, you, the writer, your reader has not yet noticed it. Your goal as a writer is to position the reader so that they can see it with their own eyes and the style is conversation. Now, that\u2019s very different from a self-defense against methodological naivete. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and \u2013 and The Sense of Style is, it\u2019s one of my favorite books on writing, and I wish that I had had it when I was a young Ph.D. student, because I think one of the weird things \u2013 and maybe this isn\u2019t true anywhere other than computer science \u2013 is that a computer science graduate education focuses a lot on the technical aspects of computer science. So, like, there\u2019s this canon of knowledge that I think most good programs do a pretty good job of stuffing into your head so that you\u2019ve got the right foundation for doing research. And even the mechanism of doing the research, if you get paired with the right advisor, gets you inculcated into you in \u2013 in a reasonable way. \n\nBut the thing that I think I got really lucky, I \u2013 I had a Ph.D. advisor who cared a lot about writing. But I \u2013 I think the way that many scientists learned to write is by reading a bunch of scientific literature. And most scientific literature is, like, I won\u2019t call it bad. Like, I think it does a job of \u2013 of conveying what it\u2019s supposed to convey. But, like, stylistically, the point that you were making, like it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not excellent writing. And so, if you\u2019re just pattern matching against the literature, like I know \u2013 I think it\u2019s very hard to learn how to be an excellent writer. \n\nSTEVEN PINKER: Well, I think that\u2019s right, and I think it \u2013 it is pattern matching with a literature, which is how writers acquire their style. In fact, that\u2019s how I start out The Sense of Style by confessing that I asked a bunch of good writers that I knew, beginning with Rebecca Goldstein, who I\u2019m married to, the famous novelist and philosopher, so which style manuals did you read when you were perfecting your craft? The most common answer was, none. (Laughter.) \n\nWhat they do is they read a lot. They read a lot of good prose and that kind of \u2013 that pattern matching, as you put it, serves as a \u2013 as a model, but also, through intensive reading, you just acquire lots of idioms, and metaphors, and tropes, and constructions and unusual, but perfectly apt vocabulary items, and you have them at your fingertips. \n\nSo part of the problem, you\u2019re right, is that that process can then be hijacked if the inputs to that pattern matching system is academic prose, but it\u2019s combined with, I think, as I mentioned, a different goal and communication, namely self-defense. And it\u2019s hobbled by what I call the curse of knowledge, a term I borrowed from behavioral economics, referring to the difficulty that [TCR 00:34:00] we all have \u2013 excuse me, the difficulty that we all have in imagining what it\u2019s like not to know something that we know. \n\nOnce you know something, it feels so obvious that you don\u2019t feel any need to explain it. So, you use abstract terms and no one knows what they\u2019re actually referring to in the world. If you\u2019re a psychologist, you talk about, you know, stimuli and, you know, what\u2019s a stimulus? Well, is it a Mickey Mouse puppet? Is it a flashing red light? And \u2013 and you don\u2019t feel the need to explain why you\u2019re talking about what you\u2019re talking about or what the reader should be imagining.\n\nSo, those are some of the other \u2013 other pitfalls in writing that often, academics fall into. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it\u2019s one of the things that I tell my 13-year-old daughter, who is a voracious reader and who enjoys to write, is as she\u2019s reading, [TCR 00:35:00] I tell her to pay attention not to just what is being said, but how it\u2019s being said, and to get opinions on both of those things. And \u2013 and I think I just \u2013 as she\u2019s more closely paid attention to the style of writing in the books that she most enjoys, she has become a better writer herself. \n\nSo, I think, you know, the thing that you\u2019re saying about choosing what you know, what prose and what literature you\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re reading and \u2013 and have modeling some of your style on that is, it seems to me, good advice. \n\nSTEVEN PINKER: Well, and \u2013 and when you come across a passage of prose that you are appreciating, like if you have the emotional reaction, wow, what a great sentence, what a great paragraph, what a great writer this is, to pause and savor the good prose and then try to reverse engineer it. Like, why is this \u2013 why am I having this reaction? Why I\u2019m enjoying this sentence so much? What is the writer doing? \n\nAnd I think good apprentice writers do that unconsciously, together with the pattern matching, just what in the \u2013 what the style manuals called the \u201cwriterly ear\u201d. Of course, it\u2019s not the ear, it\u2019s the brain, but it is this accumulation of patterns. But I think it also has to be a more active process of thinking, what is the writer doing and why does this \u2013 why does this pattern resonate so well? \n\nAnd I do remember many episodes of doing that when I (crosstalk/inaudible), wow, this writer, wow, she really knows what she\u2019s doing and how did she get away with it? What is she doing, what\u2019s the trick? (Laughter.)\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter.) Which \u2013 which is a good segue way into talking about your newest book, which I think is full of things \u2013 full of these quotes and passages where, you know, I will \u2013 I\u2019ve got a dog-eared and Post-it Note annotated version of your book, where you said a bunch of things that I think were very concise, beautiful ways of expressing some of the things that I\u2019ve felt for a long while. \n\nSo, let\u2019s talk a little bit about \u2013 about this book. So, it\u2019s titled Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters. And I think everyone should go out right now and buy a copy of this book and read it very carefully, cover to cover. So, maybe we can start at the beginning where, you know, you talk a little bit about why does rationality matter at all. \n\nSTEVEN PINKER: Yeah, it\u2019s an eccentric question, because you can\u2019t even think about it without having already answered it. (Laughter.) Namely, if [TCR 00:38:00] you\u2019re considering that question or any question, if you\u2019re seeking reasons, if you\u2019re seeking answers, you\u2019re already committed to rationality. It\u2019s what\u2019s \u2013 what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s too late to debate it, in the sense that once we have shown up and we\u2019re in the \u2013 we\u2019re playing the game of persuading, convincing, inducing reasons, we \u2013 we signed onto rationality. As long as we\u2019re not bribing people or threatening them or just having them mouth a catechism, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve already committed to rationality. It\u2019s just a question of whether you \u2013 whether you\u2019re doing it well or not. \n\nNow, you can also kind of step outside that \u2013 that paradox of \u2013 I compare it to lifting yourself up by your bootstraps or flowing into your sails. There is something paradoxical about using reason to justify reason, because you can\u2019t do something with nothing. But you can \u2013 then can ask practically, more pragmatically, well, what has the reason bought us? \n\nAnd one of the things is people who are more rational, in the sense that they are less likely to fall prey to the various fallacies and biases that cognitive psychologists have identified, do on average have better outcomes. They\u2019re healthier. They\u2019re less likely to get into mishaps, and romantic spats, and to lose their jobs and make foolish decisions. \n\nAs a society, the subject of two of my other books, which we haven\u2019t talked about, Enlightenment Now and The Better Angels of Our Nature, both of which try to document progress as a real historical phenomenon, a quantifiable set of trends, namely we live longer, our kids die less. We \u2013 we learn more, we have more leisure time, we fight fewer wars. There\u2019s less violence against women, there\u2019s less institutionalized bigotry. All of those things, how did we come to enjoy them? \n\nWell, it isn\u2019t that this universe contains some force called progress. That\u2019s kind of mystical. In fact, if anything, the universe tries to grind us down. It\u2019s constantly throwing pandemics at us, and \u2013 and natural disasters and entropy, things wearing down, and falling apart and rotting. To the extent that life gets better, it\u2019s only because people have applied their ingenuity to try to make it better. We\u2019ve invented antibiotics and vaccines, and intergovernmental organizations, and liberal democracies brain children that \u2013 that fight back against a pitiless cosmos, and allow us to increments of well-being. \n\nSo, ultimately, rationality matters for ascertaining the good things in life. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and rationality is not a super hard argument to make to a computer scientist. \n\nSTEVEN PINKER: (Laughter.) Right. Well, it\u2019s kind of mechanized. A computer is mechanized rationality, in a way. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And one of the things that I\u2019ve discussed with many other guests on this podcast is that if you don\u2019t have rational processes for making, creating, developing or understanding complex things, you really do get stuck pretty quickly. \n\nAnd, you know, so for instance, if the processes that you use to understand or construct things aren\u2019t rational, then they tend not to compose, which means that you really do have to hold way too much stuff in your head, which then limits the scope of the problems you can solve. So, you have to be able to stack your abstractions. And \u2013 and it\u2019s just hard to imagine how that happens without rationality. And, you know, also when things break or you encounter something that you don\u2019t understand, if you don\u2019t have rational processes to investigate what\u2019s going on, you \u2013 you just have a hard time fixing them. \n\nAnd so, you know, I think a lot of computer scientists, and scientists in general, sort of get this and almost take it for granted, but one of the things that we\u2019re seeing right now is maybe we can\u2019t take for granted that rationality is as important as it is. \n\nSTEVEN PINKER: Yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 well, the \u2013 the \u2013 I mean, what you\u2019ve just explained is, I think, it\u2019s exactly right. Problems are inevitable and problems have solutions, but we will never arrive at them unless we try to \u2013 to solve them. \n\nThere is a different mindset, though, which is that problems are the result of the malevolent designs of evil people, and that progress comes from defeating them, from \u2013 from destroying them, and that human history is a battle of good \u2013 good versus evil. We\u2019re on the good side and we should all try to demonize, marginalize, silence [TCR 00:43:00] defeat, annihilate the enemy. \n\nSo, yeah, that\u2019s a different way of looking at problems, everything from violence to inequality to economic stagnation to climate change. And, you know, implicitly and explicitly, I do believe that looking at our problems from a mindset of problem solving is more effective than seeking monsters to destroy. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. You \u2013 you actually, and it may be a little bit related to what you said, you have this beautiful quote towards the end of the book, where you say, \u201cOur powers of reason are guided by our motives and limited by our points of view.\u201d And then you go on to say in the same paragraph, \u201cImpartiality, the core of rationality, is a reconciliation of our biased and incomplete notions into an understanding of reality that transcends any one of us. Rationality then is not just a cognitive virtue, but a moral one.\u201d And like, I think it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s such a beautiful way of describing one of the reasons why rationality is important. \n\nSTEVEN PINKER: Yeah, and it\u2019s \u2013 it was a kind of epiphany that I had while \u2013 while writing the book, that if you delve into moral philosophy, into what actually \u2013 what do we mean when we say something is moral or immoral, right or wrong, it often \u2013 at least some moral philosophers would say that it ultimately is a matter of impartiality, as long \u2013 that in the sense that if you want something for yourself, then you can\u2019t very well deny it to others, at least not if you want them to take you seriously. \n\nAnd we all have to persuade one another to do what we want and not \u2013 to help us, not hurt us. Well, as long as you\u2019ve opened up that dialogue, you can\u2019t very well say, what\u2019s good for me counts. What\u2019s good for you, we can blow off because I\u2019m me and you\u2019re not. I mean, that just \u2013 that just doesn\u2019t fly. \n\nYou\u2019ve got to say that what\u2019s \u2013 you know, what\u2019s sauce for the goose, you\u2019ve got to endorse the golden rule, the categorical imperative, the choosing your position from behind a veil of ignorance. All of these conceptions of morality ultimately hinge on impartiality or objectivity, namely you \u2013 you can\u2019t rig the game to favor yourself. You\u2019ve got \u2013 everyone\u2019s got a go. All lives are equal. Everyone\u2019s interests count. \n\nWell, that\u2019s very close to the heart of morality. Maybe that is the heart \u2013 maybe that is morality, but of course, it\u2019s also the heart of rationality, namely the what\u2019s true is true. What\u2019s real is real. We are flawed primates. We have bigger brains than other \u2013 other apes, but we\u2019re still saddled with lots of limitations because of our hardware and our evolutionary history.\n\nWhat we often do when we try to become more rational is to climb out of our \u2013 our self-serving biases, our various myopia and shortsightedness, and to come to an understanding of truth as it really is, not as we want it to be. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and so, I \u2013 yeah, maybe \u2013 maybe related to that is you, in the book, spend a considerable amount of time talking about things like commons and public goods. You know, so at one point, you talk about this \u2013 these potentially poor judgments that we make because we set things like our social discount rate too high, you know, so we\u2019re, you know, we\u2019re being overly optimistic about the \u2013 about now, at the cost of the future. And you \u2013 you sort of go into the, you know, sort of psychology and logic of that \u2013 that flavor of bias. \n\nBut, you know, you also talk about things that I had never heard about before. So, you know, mechanisms for dealing with these \u2013 these sorts of potential bad tradeoffs that we might be making, you \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 it\u2019s sort of a funny, funny phrase or name for something, but this idea of libertarian paternalism, which is, yeah, to paraphrase you, using policy to sort of strap ourselves to the mass like Odysseus so that we don\u2019t succumb to the sirens of the now. And \u2013 but yet, you know, while you make it costly to unstrap yourselves, you still give people the freedom to unstrap themselves for the mass. So, can you \u2013 you talk a little bit about that idea? \n\nSTEVEN PINKER: Yes, it\u2019s a cheeky phrase, because it sounds like [TCR 00:48:00] an oxymoron. Libertarian paternalism, coined, I think by Cass Sunstein, my colleague at Harvard and who\u2019s coauthored books with Richard Thaler and Daniel Kahneman and \u2013 and others, often summarized by the single word, nudge. And this is the idea that governments can do a lot of good by changing the environment so that what people do out of inertia, laziness, defaults, falling back on their instincts also happens to be good for them. \n\nAnd \u2013 but that it is not a matter of, you know, totalitarian, Maoist coercion, like we will decide what\u2019s good for you and you will \u2013 you will do it and you will enjoy it. You will like it. But rather, you can always opt out by just doing what comes naturally, it will work out for you in the long run. \n\nThe classic example is opting out versus opting in for a defined contribution retirement plan. So, do you \u2013 you know, each of us could, at the end of the month, write a check or go to a website, put aside part of our paycheck toward our retirement, so, a wise thing to do because it compounds exponentially, so a little bit now means you could be \u2013 have a comfortable retirement. But, you know, every month, it\u2019s always more tempting to buy the bauble or the vacation or the \u2013 the indulgence. \n\nNow, a lot of employers, when you sign up, they say, well, how would you like it if we set aside, you know, five percent or 10 percent of your paycheck and put it in an account for you? You just \u2013 you never see it, and you don\u2019t have to do it. Better still, instead of giving people that option, they just say, if you don\u2019t do anything, if you click through all these pages, if you throw out the paperwork, you\u2019re in. If you do the work [TCR 00:50:00] of checking the box or I\u2019m clicking the \u2013 the tab, then you can opt out. But it\u2019s an eensy-weensy bit more cognitive work to do that. And so, people do tend to opt for the, I think, the withdrawal at the end of the month.\n\nLikewise, for organ donation, if when you renew your driver\u2019s license, you have to tick a box so that if you die in an accident and your \u2013 your brain is destroyed, but your body is okay, your organs can then save the lives of other people. Or you can \u2013 it happens if you don\u2019t do anything and you\u2019ve got to tick a box so that your organs are \u2013 are not eligible for donation. And a lot more people become organ donors when they don\u2019t have to do that onerous labor of ticking a box. \n\nAnd there are other examples, and it\u2019s a widespread \u2013 part of a widespread movement in government, sometimes called behavioral insights, or \u2013 or again nudge, to try to figure out ways of changing bureaucratic procedures, the way laws are stated, the way they\u2019re publicized, just the interface between government and the people, so that the things that everyone wants, like fewer accidents, better health, come naturally to people. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so you also talk about this notion of public goods games, which are prisoner\u2019s dilemmas with more than two players, and, you know, make what I think is a pretty convincing argument about how these might help us make better decisions when we\u2019re thinking about balancing these, you know, balancing communal goods versus individual interests. Can you say a little bit more about that? \n\nSTEVEN PINKER: Yeah, it\u2019s an example of one of the conceptual tools that I think every educated person should master. And the biggest motivation for writing Rationality is that I thought that there are a number of fairly straightforward mathematical, logical, philosophical computational tools that, like reading and writing, should just be at the fingertips of every thoughtful person, so that when they come across an example, they \u2013 they recognize it.\n\nAnd one of the chapters in the book is on game theory, which is one of those families of tools. And one of the scenarios in game theory, as you \u2013 as you explained, is called the prisoner\u2019s dilemma when it involves two players, or the public goods game when it involves more than two. \n\nAnd the idea is that, well, I\u2019ll just simplify it in the case of the public goods games and the way it\u2019s actually studied in the laboratory. Imagine that everyone is given an endowment. The experimenter gives you, you know, 10 bucks. You can contribute as much as you want to a common pot or keep it for yourself. If you \u2013 whatever you put into the common pot gets doubled by the experimenter and distributed evenly among all the players. \n\nNow, the best thing for everyone to do would be to contribute the max. You put in 10 bucks, you will walk away with 20. It seems like a no-brainer. Except that since it\u2019s divided evenly among everyone, if you were to hang onto your ten and everyone else contributed their 10 and then it was doubled and then divided, you know, say nine ways, then you\u2019d do even better because you\u2019d selfishly keep your own endowment, you\u2019d be a free rider, plus you\u2019d get the investment returns from everyone else. \n\nNow, everyone thinks that. Everyone thinks, well, I\u2019m not going to be the sucker and give up all my money, if any of the other guys could just hang on to theirs and get paid anyway. So I\u2019m going to do the logical thing and keep it for myself. \n\nWell, what seems to be the logical thing turns out to be the illogical thing when you consider everyone together, because then no one contributes and no one gets anything, so you end up with the worst outcome. \n\nSo that\u2019s a public goods game and that is what happens in the lab, that all things being equal, as people play multiple times and catch on to the benefits of free riding, everyone becomes a free rider and the contributions to the pot dwindle to zero. \n\nNow, it\u2019s kind of a model for a lot of social dilemmas, like should I consume fossil fuels? I get to be, you know, cozy in the winter and cool during the summer and go in a nice, air-conditioned car to work instead of sweating at a bus stop. It\u2019s like public goods such as, you know, a lighthouse or security cameras or a pedestrian overpass, I would benefit if everyone else pays for it, and I shirk on my taxes. But then if everyone had that freedom, the overpass would never be built or the lighthouse would never be built. \n\nSo it occurs over and over again. The most famous example or at least most famous parable might be the tragedy of the Commons, where every shepherd brings his sheep to graze on the town commons because he \u2013 he ends up better off with a fatter sheep. But if everyone does it, they could denude the Commons faster than the grass could grow back and then everyone\u2019s sheep starves. \n\nSo it\u2019s a whole \u2013 and, you know, everyone has an incentive to pull out the maximum number of fish. But if all the fishers do it, then the fishery collapses, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. \n\nSo it\u2019s a general dilemma of social life, maybe it\u2019s the dilemma of social life, and we\u2019re facing it now, above all in carbon emissions, both among individuals within a society, but even more acutely among countries on the planet where each country would be best off if it kept its economic growth going with the easily captured energy and fossil fuels and let all the other countries conserve and \u2013 and grow more slowly. But then, of course, the whole planet ends up worse off, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing this very week at COP26 in Glasgow. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, so I think that, and you know, this next thing to me feel like the two most urgent reasons why we need to figure out how to get people to embrace more rationality. So like there are these public goods things, and then there\u2019s this like really interesting section you have in the book where you sort of describe these two modes of being, so reality versus mythology. \n\nAnd like, I\u2019m going to paraphrase a little bit, and you can correct me if I\u2019ve got this wrong, but you know, the \u2013 it strikes me that the difference between living and reality is about direct connection, first-person observability, proximity. You know, and if you have those things, like you are, you\u2019re in this reality mode where you tend to make more rational decisions that have more rational interactions. \n\nAnd then if you have distance and indirect connection and lack of consequences and whatnot, like, you can very easily get into this mode where you\u2019re living in mythology, where, you know, you tend to have more irrationality influencing, both the decision you\u2019re making, but the \u2013 you know, the mood that you\u2019re in even. And so I wonder if you could say a little bit more about that. \n\nSTEVEN PINKER: Well, this speaks to one of the most salient aspects of rationality in our public discussions today, which is why do so many people believe such malarkey. Like, jet contrails are really mind-dispersing, mind-altering drugs dispersed in a secret government program. \n\nNow, the people who believe these things are not, you know, lunatics in every aspect of their lives. Presumably they, you know, they hold a job, they \u2013 they keep the gas in the car, and they get the kids clothed and fed and off to school on time. So, you know, where\u2019s the rationality? Where\u2019s the irrationality? \n\nAnd that attitude, you can\u2019t find out, no one knows, so let\u2019s believe what expresses our moral values, our deepest convictions, the glory of our tribe, the evil of the opposing tribe. \n\nThat\u2019s how a lot of people form beliefs, at least beliefs that don\u2019t directly impinge on their day-to-day lives. Now they can impinge on their day-to-day lives. There can be crossover as when someone refuses a vaccine out of the belief that it\u2019s a way for Bill Gates to implant microchips in people\u2019s bodies. So someone who refuses a vaccine for that reason certainly departed from what I call the mythology zone and their \u2013 their beliefs are infecting their reality zone. But I think a lot of them, people do keep them separate, and that\u2019s how they can get away with these outlandish beliefs. \n\nThe beliefs aren\u2019t things that they feel have to be true or false, or at least they don\u2019t have to be verified as true or false. You spread them because they state something that\u2019s more important than literal truth or falsity; namely, some moral conviction. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And what do you think we can do to get people to operate more in that reality zone? And like, I guess as a technologist, one of the things that I worry about is whether or not technology is allowing people to operate more in this mythology zone than the reality zone, than they otherwise would if there were no technology. \n\nSTEVEN PINKER: Yeah, and technology as a user experience is a kind of a form of magic, more and more so. The \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s a vital question. It\u2019s not an easy one to \u2013 to answer because it does go against the grain of the part of human nature that has beliefs as identity expressions rather than \u2013 than verifiable factual claims. \n\nIt\u2019s really the scientific revolution in the Enlightenment that instilled in us this rather unnatural conviction that all of our beliefs should be held because they are \u2013 they\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019re true or false \u2013 I mean, because they\u2019re true. That\u2019s not a natural way of thinking, but mainly because until the scientific revolution, and you couldn\u2019t find out. I mean, who knows \u2013 who \u2013 who could possibly have an informed opinion as to how the universe began or what was the cause of fortune and misfortune, or what really goes on in palaces and halls of power behind closed doors before there were, say, recordings and archives and historians, before there was science and cosmology and government records.\n\nThere, because you literally couldn\u2019t find out for most of our evolutionary \u2013 our recorded history, then belief that just affirmed your identity was the best belief you could have anyway, the only belief you could have, anyway. \n\nSo now we have the benefit of science, of government recordkeeping, of historical research, of sourced journalism, and the challenge is how to get people to realize that that\u2019s really a better way of holding beliefs than \u2013 than what makes you feel good about your side. \n\nAnd partly, it\u2019s that these \u2013 each one of these institutions has to constantly reestablish its own credibility by showing its methods, showing its work, confessing to mistakes, making it clear that journalism, at least when it\u2019s done right, is not just, you know, a bunch of guys saying something, but they \u2013 they have to surrender to the demands of editors and fact checkers, and they have to have sources for what they write. And when they make an error, they correct it and it humiliates the writer who wrote it. But they \u2013 they do it anyway because they\u2019re (inaudible) preserving the reputation for credibility of the institution, namely the newspaper. And the same with science and with government agencies. \n\nNow, that often doesn\u2019t happen, partly because institutions tend to get captured by political tribes of their own. So universities have drifted, and indeed almost captured as a branch of left wing politics, to the detriment to the credibility of science in universities.\n\nAnd to maintain a reputation for objectivity and accuracy, and for \u2013 to the extent that they can - to explain the methods like why are we recommending masks or vaccines or fasten your seatbelt or installing a smoke detector, I think there should be more of an effort on the part of various officials, whether it\u2019s corporations or governments or academia or journalism, to explain the basis behind their \u2013 their pronouncements. \n\nI myself, in writing Enlightenment Now was rather stunned to see graphs showing deaths from car crashes, deaths from fires, deaths from drownings all going down by a lot over the decades, occupational deaths. And the part of me that always bristled at safety-ism and all these annoying rules and regulations and safety interlocks, well, I\u2019ve kind of had second thoughts like, hey, these really save lives, they\u2019re not just government bureaucrats, but no one is aware of these data that you literally are much safer against getting killed in a car crash or getting electrocuted or drowning or dying in a fire than \u2013 than you were 30, 50, 100 years ago, thanks to all of these safety innovations. Now, if we\u2019ve known that they actually work, I think we\u2019d be less resistant, and so on for a number of other regulations and impositions in our lives. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, one of the fascinating things to me with Enlightenment Now, which is another fantastic book that everyone should go read, is that some of the criticism levied against it felt like there were a cohort of extremely well-meaning people who would like some of these processes that you are describing, like the vehicle-related mortality they ultimately wanted to be zero and that they maybe were feeling a little bit threatened by the amount of progress that we have made so far, that if we acknowledge the progress, then we will suddenly not have urgency to continue making progress. And I see some of that. I see that a lot, actually. And so I wonder if you know, like you\u2019ve \u2013 you perceive some of the criticism in the same way and, you know, like how you\u2019ve thought about addressing it. \n\nSTEVEN PINKER: Yeah, it is a kind of pushback that I get all the time. Not so much with, you know, say, car safety or swimming pool drownings, but when it comes to war, extreme poverty, racism, violence against women, all of which have shown progress, which strangely enough, progressives feel threatened by. \n\nIt has to be that that the world has never been worse than it is now, often because of the fear that if you say that things have gotten better, people will be complacent. Oh, the problem\u2019s solved, it\u2019s perfect. Let\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s not worry about it anymore. \n\nNow, I think it\u2019s the exact opposite. For one thing, we shouldn\u2019t make the blunder in arithmetic of confusing the claim that something has declined to something \u2013 to the claim that it\u2019s zero, and I get that all the time. You know, it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not like higher mathematics that if fewer people get killed in war now than they did 10 years ago, that\u2019s not the same thing as saying that no one gets killed in war, but people do that kind of autocorrect.\n\nAnd the - far from lulling us into complacency, for me, it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s the ultimate proof that activism and problem-solving and reform work, namely they\u2019re not just feel-good, bleeding heart causes. They actually succeed. We got the \u2013 the happiness, the health, the income of African-Americans really has gotten better since the early \u201860s. It doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t still gaps that we ought to rectify. But the \u2013 trying to alleviate the problems can actually work. The fact that poverty, when it\u2019s measured after government transfers and taxes has gone down, that is an argument for more policies that \u2013 that try to nibble away at poverty. Likewise for air pollution. Likewise for war and crime and so [TCR 01:08:00] on. \n\nI think it\u2019s ironic that it\u2019s often progressives who seem to hate the idea that progress has happened. For me, it\u2019s the ultimate vindication of a true progressive ideology; namely, we don\u2019t have to settle for what we have because our ancestors didn\u2019t and things got better. So let \u2013 let\u2019s try for more. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I tend to agree with you. I often describe myself to folks as a short-term pessimist, long-term optimist. And, you know, I know many engineers have this mindset because you \u2013 you wake up every morning and you \u2013 you\u2019ve chosen a career where your job is to go solve problems. \n\nAnd when you\u2019re in the middle of solving a complicated problem, it can seem overwhelming. It\u2019s like, oh, this is, you know, too intractable, I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m not going to be able to solve it. Like, you know, why isn\u2019t this already better? \n\nBut the long-term optimist piece of me is \u2013 is all about rationality, because for me, that maybe the most important thing about rationality isn\u2019t so much knowing a bunch of things or having a solved problem, but I\u2019ve got a process by which I can asymptotically get closer to objective truth or a solved problem or whatnot. \n\nAnd you sort of said it, you know, like, really beautifully, and I think this is a thing that we all need to have more of, which is this, you know, another quote from your book. So, the secular equivalent to this monotheistic belief is there is objective truth. I don\u2019t know it, and neither do you. But like, thank goodness we have a process to \u2013 yeah, which is painful that it\u2019s trial and error and we don\u2019t always get everything right and we have to go back and revisit and refine, but like that is the \u2013 yeah, that is the engine of progress, so to speak. Like maybe our own morality and that mechanism are the thing \u2013 are the two reasons why things have gotten better over time. \n\nSTEVEN PINKER: Indeed, and the idea of objective truth is an aspiration because no one knows when they have it and no one ever will. But we can do \u2013 do our best to get as close as possible to it. And by criticizing one another\u2019s hypotheses, keeping the ones that seem to withstand the criticism, learn from our mistakes, we still might be totally wrong, but the fact that we have decimated extreme poverty, the fact that we\u2019ve reduced deaths from war, deaths from drownings and burnings and child mortality and infectious disease, suggests we\u2019re probably not wrong about everything, because if we were, how did we make this progress? \n\nSo, and we still ought to be prepared to be surprised. A lot of our beliefs now no doubt will turn out to be false. So, we should be open to that, but also open to the possibility that if we follow the right rules, that over time, our understanding can come into greater correspondence with reality. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And \u2013 and you know, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re almost out of time here. There\u2019s so much good stuff in this book. And again, I just encourage everyone to go buy themselves a copy right now and read it. But like maybe the last thing that we can talk about in the time that we have it, which I think is, you know, the \u2013 the kernel of some good practical advice. \n\nSo, you know, later in the book, you say that when people evaluate an idea in small groups with the right chemistry, you know, which I think implied emphasis on the right chemistry, which is that they don\u2019t agree on everything, but have a common interest in finding the truth. They catch on to each other\u2019s fallacies and blind spots, and usually the truth wins. \n\nAnd I really do very strongly agree with that assertion that you made in the book, and I don\u2019t know if you have thoughts on how we can do more of that versus wasting so much of our energy not being in small groups with the right chemistry and like this idea that like, you know, it\u2019s worth it to have this painful interaction with one another to try to find truth. \n\nSTEVEN PINKER: Yeah, we have to be aware of our biases, like the my-side bias, the bias to steer the truth toward or steer assertions toward the truth that makes your side look noble and wise and the other side look foolish and evil, and our own confirmation bias, our own other self-serving biases, our motivated reasoning. \n\nSo that\u2019s the first \u2013 it\u2019s kind of the first step of a 12-step program to overcome \u2013 help trying to overcome the bias, and the other is to be \u2013 to submit to communities that have a higher interest in getting to the truth, like science with its peer review, journalism with its fact-checking and editing, Wikipedia with its community of editors that sign on to the pillars of Wikipedia, which is to objectivity and truth and sourcing.  It\u2019s bigger than any of us. None of us is objective or rational or wise enough to accomplish rationality on our own. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But it does seem that that \u2013 that that objectivity and the dogged, sometimes painful and uncomfortable pursuit of some kind of objective truth is really the linchpin for rationality, and if you sort of lose your desire to \u2013 to seek objective truth, and like this is one of the things I do worry a little bit about that I\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019ve seen more of than I\u2019m comfortable with over the past years. Like, we have blatant disregard of good science, but we also have the mythologizing of bad science, and both are sort of equally \u2013 equally bad. And I think we have to have a high degree of commitment to these truth-seeking processes and just acknowledge that they\u2019re messy. \n\nSTEVEN PINKER: Yes, they are messy, but as you say, even if you\u2019re a pessimist over the short term when looking at their messiness, you can be an optimist over the long term and seeing which claims do survive the rough and tumble of debate and falsification. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome. Well, Professor Pinker, thank you so, so much for taking time to talk about your career and your books, and \u2013 and especially this very important new book with us today. It\u2019s been a real pleasure talking with you.\n\nSTEVEN PINKER: Thanks for having me on. I\u2019ve enjoyed the conversation. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome. \n\n\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Well, that was Kevin\u2019s conversation with Steven Pinker. I have to say my brain is kind of going on overdrive thinking about what you were mentioning towards the end of your conversation about what the role the tech has in maybe either reinforcing some of these more negative things or potentially helping improve things, if that would be possible as well. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I do think that we have a bunch of roles in helping create a more rational world. And I think one of the things that tech folks tend to do is you just take rationality for granted because it\u2019s very hard to write software and do computer science and all of the things that we do unless you use rational processes for doing your work.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But we probably are, and I think you can definitely see it over the past handful of years, we\u2019ve taken for granted how much rationality exists in the broader world. \n\nAnd so I think we have a role to play in explaining complicated things, the complicated things that we do, better to a wider audience so that they can have more agency and you know, ability to fully understand how to integrate these things into their lives and make smart decisions about how to use the tools that we have. \n\nAnd then like, we also have to think, I think, in balance about whether the technologies that we are creating are leading to more rational thought versus less and like, that\u2019s a big, big deal at the moment. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, it really is. I mean, and it\u2019s interesting, that\u2019s kind of what I was thinking about as the two of you were talking was, how do we ensure that the things that we\u2019re creating are creating more rationality and not less? \n\nBecause, you know, earlier the two of you were talking about pattern matching when it comes to, you know, literature and language, but pattern matching is obviously a thing that we do with tech a lot too. And oftentimes, you know, we pattern match for things like engagement and for reactions. And sometimes those patterns will match to behaviors and, you know, inputs and stimuli that are not rational. \n\nSo I think it does bring up a lot of questions about what role tech can play in, as you said, both encouraging people to be more aware and maybe have more of an understanding about what the tech does, but I think it\u2019s also something that technologists need to think about in terms of what is their role in \u2013 in creating these systems and what is it reinforcing. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And then there still is this very important thing that is individual responsibility in a world that has a lot of technology and a lot of information flow and a lot of connectivity between people where ideas \u2013\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 move around super-fast because, you know, one of the things he does early in the book is he \u2013 he talks about this difference between System 1 and System 2 thinking. \n\nSo System 1 thinking is fast and intuitive, and it\u2019s what we use almost all of the time, and System 2 thinking is sort of slow and deliberative, and it\u2019s where you sort of look at a thing and you engage all of your rational faculties to try to get to objective truth.\n\nAnd we are so, so, so conditioned to be in that System 1 thinking. Like, he got me in the book in one of the traps. So he tells you what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s like, hey, like here\u2019s the System 1 and System 2 thinking and like, you know, the pitfalls. And then he ask us, I think, three chapters later as readers to think about these three questions and they\u2019re tricks. And like he\u2019s told you, he\u2019s hinted heavily to you that they\u2019re trick questions that he\u2019s about to ask. I read the first one and I\u2019m tricked. \n\nAnd, you know, I\u2019ve spent years trying to build up my rationality toolkit. Yeah, like, for god sakes, I have a \u2013 I have graduate degrees in computer science and mathematics. Like I\u2019ve spent years trying to \u2013 and still, I\u2019m tricked.  \n\nAnd so it is unsurprising that as innate as that System 1 intuitive system is, that like we\u2019re having a hard time with, you know, with propagation of misinformation, for instance. \n\nAnd, you know, like the thing that we all, I think, have to commit ourselves to doing is just slow it down a little bit and thinking just a little bit more deeply. It\u2019s like you read a thing. Like, why do I believe that this thing is true.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like why -- what is the evidence here that this is a thing that I should trust? \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I think -- I think you\u2019re exactly right, and I think that that\u2019s something we can all take from this, slow it down, start to think about things.\n\nAnd I\u2019m definitely excited to read this book. The conversation was great. Once again, Steven\u2019s book is called Rationality, what it is, why it\u2019s scarce, why it matters. So definitely check that out. \n\nThat does it for our show today. Thank you again to Steven Pinker for his insights and optimism. \n\nAnd next time on the podcast, we are going to do our 2021 Year in Review. And once again, what a year it\u2019s been, right? \n\nIf you have anything that you would like to share with us, email us at BehindtheTech@Microsoft.com.
