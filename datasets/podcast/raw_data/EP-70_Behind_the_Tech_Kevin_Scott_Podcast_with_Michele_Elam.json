{"episode": "EP-70 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Michele Elam", "text": "KEVIN SCOTT: Michele Elam is the William Robertson Coe Professor of Humanities in the English Department at Stanford University, and a Race and Technology Affiliate at the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity. Her work is informed by the understanding that racial perception and identification impact outcomes for health, wealth and social justice. \n\nHer most recent book project, Race Making in the Age of AI, considers how the humanities and arts function as crucibles through which to frame and address urgent social questions about equity and social justice and socially transformative technologies.\n\nShe teaches what sounds like fascinating interdisciplinary courses at Stanford, ones I really wish I\u2019d had the opportunity to take when I was an undergraduate student, and I get to work with her closely at the Institute for Human Centered Artificial Intelligence at Stanford.\n\nMichele, I\u2019m so glad to have you on the podcast today.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: I\u2019m so happy to be here. I look forward to talking with you. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, so look, we always start these conversations by going all the way back to folks\u2019 childhood, and, you know, how you got interested in the things that ultimately led you to choose the career path that you were on, or, you know, maybe what you didn\u2019t choose, and like, what just sort of organically happened. So tell us a little bit about, you know, your childhood and like, how you got on to the path that you\u2019re on. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: Thank you. I feel like we\u2019re already in a therapy session. \n\n(Laughter.) \n\nBecause the path chose me. It\u2019s so odd, really, how I got interested in this. I think about this all the time when I\u2019m teaching my students, who it always looks like they have a straightforward path to a major and then a career. But mine was really peripatetic. \n\nSo I was a humanities person. I wasn\u2019t a technologist. I wasn\u2019t particularly interested in math. I wasn\u2019t bad at engineering. My father was an astronautics engineer, and he worked on the Apollo 13 tracking system. And that influenced me a lot, because I remember him. He was a straight-up engineer, and he hated that the government was sending monkeys into space. He thought that was completely unnecessary. He hated the politics of the Cold War, the sort of politics informing.\n\nAnd at that time, you know, remember very early AI, it was in the \u201860s and \u201870s, it was mostly government contracts. He was working for Control Data and then very early artificial intelligence. \n\nAnd I was completely the opposite. I don\u2019t know whether it was just having a father for whom the world was a problem to solve. There was a whole engineering mindset that had full explanatory force for everything. You know, and when you\u2019re growing up, that totalizing view of the world always frustrated me. We were always at loggerheads. \n\nHe unfortunately passed away during COVID, not of COVID, but right before I joined the Institute for Human-Centered AI, or thereabout, and he would have been flabbergasted that I was sitting around the table. \n\nAs you know, that Institute, at least at the time I joined, had eight [Associate Directors]\u2013 it was very interdisciplinary, intentionally. So Fei Fei Li and John Etchemendy decided that they wanted, in addition to computer scientists and engineering, they wanted \u2013 I was representing arts and diversity, humanistic perspectives. We had someone in medical school, someone from law. She\u2019d taken sort of CP Snow\u2019s Two Cultures and blown it up, and she really wanted people sitting at the table. \n\nBut before then, that table didn\u2019t exist. And the cultural status, at least for my father, of being an engineer, doing things, making things, always seemed, unintentionally I\u2019m sure, by him or culture, to set technology and technologists above the arts, which are always seen as sort of ornamental, nice. You know, maybe they add local color to a product or something, and so, I was always frustrated by the different cultural statuses with that. \n\nSo all to say, it is bizarre that I am sitting here talking to you, Kevin, and I think we \u2013 if I\u2019m not mistaken, we actually met in Rome. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: We did.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: The Dialogues. And that was really what started, I would say, quite late in life, obviously, my interest in this, not just because Fei Fei and John approached me about it, but there was a conversation there with spiritual leaders, right, the Pope, the Pope\u2019s people who were brilliant, Eric, Father Eric Salobir, and \u2013 and other people, who were talking about spirituality and AI, and not in an apocalyptic or hallelujah way, but like, what are the bigger implications? \n\nAnd there was a conversation about storytelling, if I recall. And the people in the room, I think, were thinking storytelling like marketing, like, how can we tell the story better? And I was like, there are so many more narratives about technology than \u201850s science fiction by white, cis male authors. I mean, that\u2019s there too, but \u2013 and I think we connected over that too, because you have such an expansive imagination. So it was a weird way to come into, all to say.\n\nAnd then I think the other strange thing that happened, I think we had talked about this too \u2013 it was before facial recognition technology. It was literally I think 25 years ago, and a photographer had taken pictures of the faculty, and unbeknownst to me, had sold my image to Getty Images. The university didn\u2019t - I wasn\u2019t at Stanford at the time \u2013 didn\u2019t know either. And I started seeing hundreds of pictures of me out there. But I started being lightened and darkened. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: And my father-in-law saw me on the side of a Boston bus as the older than average, non-English speaking student going back to school. I was on Harvard\u2019s Rainbows, I was on a Hispanic Congressional Caucus website as a proud Latina moving in. So I became very interested in, one, the appropriation and commercialization of people\u2019s images. \n\nAnd I remember you telling me at the time, you\u2019re like, \u201cThat is nothing.\u201d It was like, you know, having your, you know, sort of proprietary relations with your own image is just the sort of start of it now because, of course, nowadays it\u2019s like, generated AI, generative AI, where you can create faces.\n\nBut it \u2013 both of those set me on a more cynical path, I think, to thinking about AI, and both because I was cautious because of my father\u2019s true believer commitment that engineers would solve the problems of the world, and then also the use of my image, and that weird sense of losing control of your identity.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, look, and I think it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to be cynical. I mean, it\u2019s sort of funny, like \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: Cautious.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, yeah, cautious, like, right, or skeptical, or pessi \u2013 you know, like I \u2013 the way that I describe engineers to most people is, and like, the way that I think about myself is I\u2019m a short-term pessimist, long-term optimist.\n\nAnd I think as an engineer, you kind of have to be, and it sounds like your dad was very much this way, so like, you, you know, by virtue of your acculturation, or, like, you know, the brain that you were born with, you kind of look at the world in terms of everything that\u2019s broken and what you can do to go fix it right? That\u2019s the impulse of engineering. And it\u2019s like a pretty jaundiced way to, you know, look at the world. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: I like the way you described it, though, because that, to me, seems also like an ethical way to look at the world. Because I remember my \u2013 it can be limited if we don\u2019t pair it with other ways of looking.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: There are different vocabularies and mindsets, yeah. But the way you just described engineering actually sounds very much like my father at his best, because he wanted to \u2013 he always would say, we shouldn\u2019t just make things because we can. We should make things because \u2013 and know what to do with them, which I realize is sort of antithetical to general intelligence. But he was very concerned with the social impacts of the things that we create and the social implications of them.\n\nAnd that that\u2019s what I hear when you say that then, too. There are problems in the world that engineering can address. I \u2013 you know, so I definitely appreciate that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I, you know, it\u2019s  really interesting. I want to go back to your father in just a second and talk about, you know, why it is that you think he may have held engineering and technology apart and above from, you know, the humanities or other things.\n\nAnd like, you know, and you and I both know in academia that there\u2019s \u2013 like always, everybody\u2019s got some stack ranking in their head of, you know, like, which thing is better than the other. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s even in the humanities, right, that \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: For sure.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 you know, at some point you\u2019re like, you \u2013 and like all of it is kind of silly, because, you know, the beautiful thing about being a human is like, we\u2019re all just playing, you know, our role. Like, hopefully we\u2019ve chosen to do the thing that we\u2019re especially good at, and hopefully we\u2019ve all got enough, you know, wisdom to understand that we don\u2019t know everything, and that we need, like, all of these other perspectives to come in and help us.\n\nYou know, particularly as engineers, like you can sort of look around and see that everything is broken, but like maybe you don\u2019t understand why. Like, maybe you don\u2019t understand, you know, that not all fixes to all problems are, you know, equal in merit. You know, maybe you don\u2019t even understand, like, what\u2019s worth fixing and what isn\u2019t. And like, that\u2019s where you need a lot of help from other people with different perspectives. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: Agree.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But, I mean, so like, how much do you think your father\u2019s perspective on things is just mindset that you\u2019re born with? Because I do think that there\u2019s some, like, really particular things about, like, an engineer brain. \n\nAnd like, how much of it is, like, you know, it sounds like he\u2019s, you know, like a Cold War, like post-World War II trained.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: I think, yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, like, a lot of it, like, culturally is like, hey, you know, like, we\u2019re in this existential, you know, battle, you know, and like, science and technology is the way that we win. And like, you know, here\u2019s the stuff that\u2019s important. And, you know, it\u2019s easy to, like, be in the middle of that, and like, you know, think that you\u2019re more important than you actually are.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: I \u2013 you know, he didn\u2019t quite have the hubris. I think it was, hopefully, I\u2019m not sure about the engineer\u2019s brain. It\u2019s like biology and also training. Because he\u2019d gone to Princeton, and which did have a liberal arts background then at the time, actually. But he, for him, I don\u2019t know if I can give this example. Well, this is \u2013 it was a sense of security and control. \n\nI was listening to a couple of your other interviews with Mira, for instance, Murati, and this sense of, you know, especially when the world is in chaos, it seems like a way of making sense of things that bypasses politics and bypasses sort of social issues, all the things that, at least I was growing, was particularly interested. \n\nI remember, to his great credit, he always wanted \u2013 I was the eldest \u2013 me to not take sewing class, which was we had \u2013 I can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s called, like home arts or something, and then \u2013 or you could fit \u2013 no, figure out how to fix a car, and, you know? And he was like, no, you need to be able to fix the car. And he would teach me these things. \n\nBut I remember him first instructing me at age 12, when I was pubescent. I know you have like, you know, they\u2019re older now, but young kids. So they\u2019re just coming into their own and their bodies. And he was like, here\u2019s the hammer and here\u2019s the nail and here\u2019s a screw and a nut. I can\u2019t remember how he described. And he\u2019s like, one is the male part, and one is the female part. \n\nAnd I was just like, this gendering of these tools is a problem, dad. And I was feeling it like kind of horrified, and that he was talking about male parts and female parts, and female parts were passive and male parts were active. And, you know, even at 12, 13, I could see the gender implication. For him it\u2019s just like, that\u2019s just how it is. \n\nAnd so it didn\u2019t take him to thinking about the way his own field incorporated social values. It was meant to be objective and neutral. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: And there was a lot in the training. You know this, too. And I have lots of engineering students, as you can imagine, at Stanford. That education has really started to change, because it used to be you had to just learn all the technical aspects, and then belatedly, maybe after you went into industry, you got to ask questions about the ethics or application. Students want to know now. Like they want, you know, they\u2019re interested in social psychology. \n\nYou know, I was just having a student talk to me about the Weizenbaum\u2019s Eliza Effect in relationship to the arts, and they want to integrate those questions about social psychology, whether or not they go and build a product, but like early on.\n\nAnd I think of my dad\u2019s era, it was very much, this is the domain of another field. You can deal with the social issues; we\u2019ll deal with the technical one. And I think he associated the social with political, that he didn\u2019t want to \u2013 that he also found muddying pure math and muddying pure \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: So I don\u2019t think he was \u2013 you know, I framed it like a battle. I hope it didn\u2019t feel like I was too cynical. But \u2013 because I really \u2013 I think I have \u2013 you know, there\u2019s a lot of talk about interdisciplinarity, and to your point, we need multiple perspectives. When you sit down at the table, which literal table, and \u2013 \n\nAnd I was luckily at HAI, we call it, as you know, the Institute for Human Centered AI. They were \u2013 we were all equal partners. However, the vocabularies, the way we talk about the world, the things we prioritize, the way we document our work, you know, in a \u2013 in a universe where the quantitative is so important, I found, I know my colleagues did too, the way to legitimize humanities and arts was often by through quantitative methods. We would start to use the same language and metrics that the engineers were to measure success or impact and things like that. \n\nAnd humanists were not humanist people in literature or theater or visual or performance art writ large, I\u2019m thinking of arts. We sounded very squishy talking about it. Like, it just \u2013 you know, the arts move us, and they\u2019re \u2013 you know, we had very vague language, or at least the way we talked about its potency, the arts potency didn\u2019t compute, literally, with some of my colleagues. \n\nSo I have come to really appreciate how hard it really is \u2013 and there\u2019s outsized money in technology in ways not in the arts \u2013 what it means to come with goodwill together and try and hear each other when we have studied differently, you know, learned differently and \u2013 and sort of speak differently about the things are important. \n\nI always found it \u2013 my father used to say, and then we\u2019ll get off my father, right? You know, the artist on the one hand, and art was often seen as sort of ornamental. He loved \u2013 he sculpted. \n\nAnd I do want to ask you, because you work with clay. Oh my gosh, you understand so much as a practitioner yourself, as an artist. \n\nBut he felt that the artist was, on the one hand, seen as sort of incidental, and he bemoaned that. He thought it should be more important. But then he also pointed out that the first thing that fascist or authoritarian governments did was get rid of the artists, because they\u2019re the ones that shape the cultural imagination. They\u2019re the ones that actually \u2013 and that\u2019s very powerful. At least, he saw they\u2019re both seen as irrelevant and yet a primary threat. And that always fascinated me. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s always \u2013 maybe this is getting a little bit too philosophical and squishy. Like, I kind of wish we had fewer of these categories that are like, about skills and professional identity, because, you know, like you\u2019re a writer, you are an artist, you\u2019re creative, but like, you also have things that you do, that you\u2019re an engineer, you\u2019re a problem-solver. Like, you have to use quantitative methods for things. And so, it\u2019s just kind of, you know, like, what context are you in, and, like what skill do you need to be able to manifest to solve the problem that you\u2019re working on? \n\nAnd like, you get a little bit \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: But do you feel like \u2013 well, I\u2019m super \u2013 you\u2019re totally \u2013 I mean, I think I know where you\u2019re going, but just, I would love that in that world, too. You authorized yourself to create. You do sculpture. You do clay, right? You work with clay. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I do.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: I only recently found this out about you because your Instagram post is amazing. \n\nBut there\u2019s a case where you took yourself seriously enough to do that. And I imagine, if you had decided to go into that as a profession, there is tension sometimes about that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and like, that\u2019s certainly when I was younger, I think this is one of the things, and I, you know, struggle with this with my children. So, you know, there\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s one thing, there\u2019s this joy that I find. Like, I just have curiosity about everything, and it\u2019s thrilling to go wallow in that curiosity.\n\nBut there, especially, I think, when you\u2019re young, like, there\u2019s a risk to, you know, casting the net too wide because there\u2019s some things that you want to do that are complicated, and you have to focus for a little while to get good enough at the, you know, like, a thing so that you can, you know, bring something to it. Like, it was hard, you know, to learn how to program well. You know, it\u2019s hard to do a bunch of things and, like, you just have to go put the time in. \n\nAnd, you know, and I think when I was younger, like that\u2019s how I invested my time. I, like, I sort of cast aside a whole bunch of things that were interesting me, because I was, like, no, I got to get good at this. Like, this is, you know, going to be my professional identity. Like, I have to focus enough to, like, you know, get into, you know, the \u2013 I don\u2019t even want to call it the elite, but like, I just want to be able to, like \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: For sure.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 at a high level, go participate with a bunch of other people who are working at a high level on this. And like, I want to be able to understand what they\u2019re doing and contribute.\n\nAnd yeah, like, I\u2019m not even saying that that\u2019s the wrong thing to do. It\u2019s sort of the advice I give to my kiddo, who, you know, my 16-year-old is a bio nerd. And, you know, like, she also, like, is interested in a gazillion different things. And I\u2019m like, look, you know, you have to, at some point, like if you care enough about this one thing, you have to invest enough of your time and energy in it to get good at it. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: You know, when you\u2019re talking, I\u2019m thinking, especially because the stakes are higher with our children, and I think with so many students that I see, well, like hundreds, you know, that tension between having deep expertise and taking the time, the duration to get good at something, whether it\u2019s in the arts, whether it\u2019s in literature, whether it\u2019s in engineering, is challenging because, for instance, you know, I\u2019ve always taught at liberal arts institutions, and that means that you have a level of expertise, but you are simultaneously also learning these other things.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: You know, I don\u2019t know if you recall, but a few years back, you know, the credentialing for engineering, our engineering majors is external. And if they could, they would grab these kids in utero and start training them. I mean, there\u2019s no profession, including my own, that wouldn\u2019t say, if you just laser focus on this and the other things can come later. \n\nI do appreciate that the opportunity with liberal education, arts education is that. And it\u2019s a balance. It\u2019s not easy, like, to find, you know, develop enough focus and real expertise to excel, not just get by, and yet also bring in, with enough \u2013 and not like, just casually like an elective, you know, an arts practice elective, and somehow students manage to do it. \n\nWe\u2019ve been thinking \u2013 some of that\u2019s a curricular thing, like can we make it so that we hold at bay whatever field of expertise it is that\u2019s saying, no, I\u2019m going to train you for this profession, which is problematic, not least of which, because it will change. \n\nBut also, you know, you said something earlier that I thought was so important. So you obviously had internalized this earlier, which was you wanted to create things that had it \u2013 that changed the world. And I think it\u2019s those places where arts and sciences connect as well then, too. \n\nYou know, Reid Hoffman, dear friend, talked about recently in a talk about that he thinks we\u2019re technosapiens, you know, that we\u2019re makers from the beginning. But I actually think we\u2019re storytelling=sapiens, because we are \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: A hundred percent.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: but they\u2019re not so far apart, if you think about it. We \u2013 not to flatten makers, and we\u2019re all makers or creators, which is to, in some ways, do a disservice to the expertise you\u2019re talking about also that is essential. \n\nBut I feel like we don\u2019t \u2013 to go back to your thing about we don\u2019t have to have categories, that\u2019s an example where we don\u2019t have to simply prioritize. We don\u2019t have to typologize, create typologies of, you know, of what we can do.\n\nYou know \u2013 you know, talking with you is always fascinating. I like the squishy philosophical actually, because it has real, practical implications when you\u2019re in school, just as you said, because a lot of the ways we teach disciplines and fields go back to the \u201850s or even before. And students, human beings are naturally, if they have \u2013 if school doesn\u2019t kill the joy of curiosity, want to know things, want to learn things.\n\nBut, you know, you mentioned, and I was thinking about this a lot when I found out that you do pottery, if you call it pottery \u2013 or do you call it pottery, the work that you\u2019re doing?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, yeah.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: Which is beautiful. You know, there\u2019s pictures of the kilns. \n\nAnd the thing about arts that I would love brought into technology more, and the woman I taught with before was the MacArthur Award winning artist, Camille Utterback, who reminded me of this too, is that the practice of artmaking is durational and iterative and recursive, and it takes time in that kiln. \n\nAnd so, what I have \u2013 partly what I would love to see more of, let\u2019s put it that way, is that the idea of size, speed, scale, efficiency, optimization, which works really well, I think, in startups and certain things, doesn\u2019t have to apply to everything, doesn\u2019t have to \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes, correct.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: Like, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re agreeing, so I\u2019m lucky you\u2019re agreeing, but I think it seeps into the way we talk about things. \n\nI was doing something on \u2013 well, I don\u2019t know what you think about that, because now you\u2019re\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: No, look, I \u2013 I \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: \u2013 creating beautiful art and (inaudible/crosstalk). \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: No, I \u2013 I violently agree. And like, I think, you know what the world needs from us is largely contextual. \n\nSo I was in Japan a few weeks ago, and, you know, no surprise, like I spent \u2013 it was a very interesting trip. So I spent the first half of the trip opening up Microsoft Research Tokyo, so like a new research lab, and like entirely focused on AI. And then I spent the last half of the week talking to a bunch of Japanese craftspeople, so potters, people who do Edo Komon, which is a dyeing practice for, like making kimono fabric, and, you know, folks who, you know, make traditional cedar barrels. And so \u2013 and like, you know, folks who make canvas bags, and so.\n\nThe vast majority of the people that I talked to on the last half of that trip have been working inside of the tradition that is their craft their entire lives, and like, the tradition itself is centuries old.\n\nAnd it\u2019s super interesting, like I think, you know \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: How do you reconcile those two things? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, I think, you know, Japan does a \u2013 you know, as a society, does a very good job reconciling the two, because on the one hand, they are more progressive than most places in the world, including in some cases, the United States, in adopting very, very advanced technologies, and like they can, while they\u2019re doing that, simultaneously revere tradition and hold on to like, these things that if the objective function for your society was economic efficiency, like they make no sense whatsoever. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: Yeah, I love that. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But in fact, they make a lot of sense inside of Japanese society, because, you know, if anything, they sort of look at the technology as purely a tool, like an instrument that\u2019s in service of, you know, Japanese people. And like, the art is like something that\u2019s in service of, you know, your soul or your spirit, or \u2013 \n\nMICHELE ELAM: Right. Right. Yeah. I love that. And I love that you said the word, revere. And the other thing in that description, it makes me realize I need to go to Japan, is that so much of AI is so future oriented. You know, it\u2019s always, it\u2019s like, unprecedented, supposedly, and never been seen, and history can get left behind, or it\u2019s seen as, you know, in an enlightenment, progressive upward arc of, you know, somehow we\u2019re getting more and more advanced, and then we can have an attitude towards the past and history as if it was more remedial or something we have to sort of get over. The way you just talked about Japanese culture as probably even revering the arts, in that sense, even more and tradition is beautiful. \n\nAnd you mentioned AI as a tool, too. You know, one of the things that has come up a lot is the idea that it\u2019s a tool, but it\u2019s not exactly neutral. I don\u2019t know how you think about that. But it does embed social values, the way language does, too. \n\nSo I love it as in its proper place, as a tool in service of it. I think sometimes we maybe say AI for good as if it\u2019s inexorably going to reconcile kind of for-profit motives with social imperatives. You know, it\u2019s a dance, I realize, but \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think calling AI or any other tool neutral is almost like a little bit of sophistry. It\u2019s kind of dancing around the issue that you really are getting at. Because, like, it doesn\u2019t matter, like, whether the piece of technology is neutral or not. Like, ultimately, a human being is going to go decide what to do with it, and human beings are absolutely not neutral. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: Yes. Well, I mean, it\u2019s interesting, because the implications of that do matter. So either it\u2019s \u2013 so if you think that \u2013 it\u2019s bad actors, you know, that it\u2019s not the technology, it\u2019s the misuse of technologies, that\u2019s one approach to solving technologies you might not like to see in the world, you know. \n\nAnd the other is what technologies when I mean social values get embedded, besides the example of my father, and male and female parts is, you know, what gets funded? Who\u2019s \u2013 who\u2019s in place to think this is valuable or not? And so, those you know...\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: A hundred percent I agree with that.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And, like, it\u2019s one of those things too that\u2019s context dependent. Like, one of the first projects that I worked on when I left academia and joined industry, like, a million years ago, is I built very early machine learning systems that made judgments about which content was adult or not. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: Ooh. That\u2019s fascinating. Yeah. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And so, you will find very quickly that that is, like very context specific. So like, what one country or society or culture finds offensive \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: Totally.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 another may find acceptable. And like, there are all of these \u2013 you know, and then there\u2019s some things where, you know, like, we all have just, you know, globally decided as human beings, like this is unequivocally, like, you know, in the category, and, you know, like, we have to treat it as such.\n\nBut, you know, it\u2019s sort of interesting and \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s eye-opening when you have to sort of confront these things, like as an engineer, because, you know, like, I was 30 years old at the time. I was, you know, like a little bit like your dad. It\u2019s like, alright, well, you know, like there\u2019s a reductive way of looking at all of this stuff, and like, the algorithm is going to be simple, and like, it\u2019s gonna \u2013 \n\nMICHELE ELAM: But I love that example. I think that\u2019s so moving, because, you know, beyond just content moderation, but, you know, at HAI they\u2019re doing work right now about if you recognize that certain technologies that were created amplify whatever bias, this is so not new to you but \u2013 or social agitation or whatever, then what are the ethics of moderating that, and how does that change across different cultures? And they\u2019ve been sort of looking at it in terms of political animus and also being having transparency, who are the moderators of it? \n\nBut you can see like within a heartbeat, if you\u2019re trying to do good, it puts you right in the realm of social psychology and ethics, and I think the best engineers, and you are so one of them, are like, gee, maybe I need to know more. I think that\u2019s important. \n\nI think \u2013 I won\u2019t name the names, but there\u2019s been a few books that have come out and said, well, humanists, people, or laypeople just need to know how the technology works more. They really \u2013 they\u2019re not credentialed to weigh in on policy or anything else, and \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: No, no, nonsense. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: Well, given that it impacts every aspect of our public and private life. \n\nBut I felt that way too. I felt like at HAI, before \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to just start critiquing something that I didn\u2019t technologically understand. But there was this tendency, and there still is, actually, at Stanford, Introduction to AI, it\u2019s almost entirely technical. Maybe there\u2019s like a unit on ethics. \n\nBut as you know, there\u2019s like huge debates and fascinating research out there, not critique meaning critical, but like that can enlarge, you know, and encourage, I think, engineers, or whoever happens to be creating, you know, the arbiters of the world in which we live, to think about the things, the way you are, the way you always have. Kevin. You\u2019ve always been like this, as far as I can tell. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: You know, I wish one of the things that we taught our young engineers was for them to lean into the sort of discomfort that arises very quickly when you\u2019re trying to build technology for human beings. Like, they lean into all sorts of discomfort, right? Because, you know, you walk into your first partial differential equations, course, and like, you know, like \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: You\u2019re uncomfortable.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: that\u2019s uncomfortable because it\u2019s hard. And like, you don\u2019t know all of the answers right away.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But you know, the weird thing, you know, again, you know, back to your dad, you know, I think \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: He\u2019s here in spirit right now. He would have loved you, Kevin.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, no, like, God bless your dad, man. I never met him, but I think I love him. Like, he sounds like a super interesting human. But like we let our engineers get away with this notion that there are straightforward answers to most questions. You know, and \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: I would love you to come in to my class, because this class that I taught \u2013 I\u2019m gonna invite you, and now we\u2019re on record, to come in and talk to these students. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I will come.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: The \u2013 oh my God, they would utterly love it, especially the way you\u2019re talking. \n\nSo when I team taught, it was Arts and AI with this artist, because I realized I needed to bring her in. And then we actually brought in people who were working on AI particularly.\n\nAnd the engineers were very uncomfortable initially with, we\u2019re talking about feminist AI, queer AI, artists, and, you know, AI artists of color dealing with like decolonial AI. You could just see their pupils dilating. \n\nBut the people who had been working in either performance or theater or literature arts, who, if they weren\u2019t familiar with it, they were, it wasn\u2019t, you know, they were either the social sciences, humanities, it didn\u2019t seem so odd to them. They were highly intimidated by what looked like the outsized intelligence and status of the engineers.\n\nAnd so, we created some assignments. I mean, they were both intimidated by each other, that\u2019s the point.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: But that\u2019s why I like undergrads and some graduate students, too, if they\u2019re not totally pre-professionalized, because they\u2019re so open and curious, you know? And if they\u2019re all \u2013 and if you can create assignments where either they\u2019re case studies or different kinds of assignments, so it\u2019s not just memorization and it\u2019s not just product design, they produced amazing things. A couple went of them on to become Rhodes Scholars and \u2013 \n\nAnd it was a stance of humility, too. We weren\u2019t dogmatic coming in there and saying, get outside of your narrow mindset. But it was \u2013 you would be very inspiring to them, because, you know, you can come and \u2013 no, I mean, think of the impact, you know, very early on, when they\u2019re young and still open, because as we get older \u2013 I won\u2019t say we. You know, once you hit 30, and you are professionalized, and you\u2019re surrounded with a certain world, and you\u2019re rewarded for certain kinds of things, there\u2019s just less of a tendency to have the kind of totally frank, open conversations that we\u2019re having right now, Kevin. That\u2019s so great you\u2019re\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, you get \u2013 there\u2019s just all \u2013 all of the natural forces, like the gravitational pull, like is all towards you\u2019re hanging around, you \u2013 you\u2019re working in teams with people who are like you. You are going to parties with people who are like you. You are \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: What parties, Kevin? Or your parents are suggesting, because we get conservative listening to what you were just suggesting to your daughter, I think it was, who\u2019s amazing, by the way. You know, we want to look after them, so we\u2019re like, you know \u2013 and they may have a passion that shows up later in life, that \u2013\n\nMy one cautionary note to this, especially if you\u2019re first gen \u2013 and I know you know your background, too, my mother didn\u2019t go to college \u2013 is the sense of like, you better get something that is making \u2013 gonna make you solvent. And so, there\u2019s this pressure. \n\nBut I cannot tell you how many times my husband, you also know, and I have seen students who are going into a field that they think is gonna, you know, pay out, or at least make them stable, and then when they\u2019re 30 or 40, have a midlife crisis, and they\u2019re like, and then \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, yeah.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: So  it\u2019s a balance. I mean, I have no idea what the answer is. It\u2019s just that \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know either. \n\nI mean, look, I \u2013 I think the thing is, you just at any point in time, like you \u2013 there are pragmatic decisions that you have to make, but like, you also need to leave yourself open to possibility and like, have, you know, at least, you know, some feelers that are outside of whatever bubble that you might be living. Like one, you have to recognize you\u2019re going to be in a bubble at some point. Like, it\u2019s just \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: Yes. Bubble recognition is hard if you\u2019re the fish in the fishbowl, for \u2013 for all of us. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: Yeah. Well, how did you \u2013 can I ask you a question? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Sure. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: How did you get into pottery? Like, I want to hear about your experience as a practitioner. It just seems a very different step than the kind of work you  do. How did you valorize or validate yourself enough to \u2013 because I\u2019ve seen some of your work and it\u2019s beautiful. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, I\u2019ve never been able to decide what I am. And like, this goes back to me as a kid. So the first thing that I wanted to be when I was really young is, like, I wanted to be an artist. Like I was going to be \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: I didn\u2019t know that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I was going to be an illustrator. Like, the first college catalogs that I had sitting on my desk were for, you know, RISD and \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: Wow. Really?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So I \u2013 you know, and like, I\u2019m not saying I ever would have been good enough to get into these places or to have a career, but, like, I just wanted to be an illustrator. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: Wow.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And then, you know, I went to \u2013 and I \u2013 right around the same time, I discover computers, and I got really fascinated by programming, and, you know, like, whatever. Like, I don\u2019t even understand it, but, like, there was a feedback loop there, where I enjoyed programming enough, where I did a lot of it, which made me better at it, which made me want to do more of it. And so, I got pretty good at programming relatively early.\n\nAnd, you know, the good thing about that is, like by the time I showed up at college and I went to a liberal arts school \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 I was good enough at programming that I didn\u2019t have to burn 100% of my cycles trying to get better at programming in college. \n\nAnd so, I was a CS major, but, like a English Literature minor. So like, I had an English Literature advisor and a CS advisor who, at some point, like, had a \u2013 you know, like a \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: That explains a lot about you.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and \u2013 and so, like, I\u2019m just always, like, interested in like stuff, like that \u2013 so I\u2019m interested in my day job, for sure. Like, I love computer science. I love programming. I love building complicated software systems. And I love the problems that trying to do those things throw at you. Like, it really does scratch a really powerful itch that I have. \n\nBut I also have all this other stuff that I want to do that, like, you know, is kind of dissimilar. And so, I do wood working, and I make bags, and I like, make machines, and I \u2013 you know, I sketch and like, and for the past, you know, year or so, like I\u2019ve been down the rabbit hole of ceramics and, you know, making pottery. \n\nAnd, you know, part of it is just I think of it almost like meditation. It\u2019s like the thing that I go do that engages a different part of my brain, where, when I\u2019m doing it, and I\u2019m doing it, like I\u2019m just fully engrossed in it. Like, I can\u2019t think about all of the other stuff that, you know, may be giving me, you know, anxiety or like, I\u2019m not making progress on it, like, in the other part of my brain. But like, I can go, you know, accomplish something with the other part of my brain, which is, like, very fulfilling and necessary. So, like, I do think they complement one another. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: Yeah, they may actually even be integrative. I mean, I think it\u2019s interesting. You know, one of the \u2013 listening to you talk about creativity, you know, and in AI, and one of the ways AI has been talked about is amplifying or blitzscaling, you know, creativity by expediting it or scaling it. \n\nBut actually, the way you talked about it as meditative, not as escapist, but as also \u2013 you know, I always, as sort of gestating, I suspect what\u2019s going on your brain is not the two halves and, you know, even the idea of the neural map is, you know, a metaphor, but that I\u2019m sure all of us have gone to bed thinking about something, and then we wake up and, you know, whatever that durational process is. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: And so, I suspect that your ceramic-making is making you a better engineer, too, and probably vice versa. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And look, I do ceramics like an engineer. Like, I\u2019ve invented tools, you know. I\u2019m like, some pieces of it I\u2019m much more precise than a normal ceramicist. You know, like, I\u2019m off buying, you know, rotary viscometers to make sure that my, you know, like, my \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: You\u2019re so wonky, Kevin.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. But like, I also \u2013 so, you know, it does two other things for me. Like, one of them is, like, you know, just purely it is a little bit escapist, because I will tell you, the more senior that I\u2019ve gotten in my career, the less individual contribution I can feel on any of the things that I\u2019m doing, because there are thousands of people, and, like they\u2019re usually years-long projects. \n\nAnd so, it just really \u2013 you know, you can\u2019t really see, you know, what you\u2019re contributing to a thing, whereas like, you go into the studio and you make a pot, like you know exactly what you\u2019ve done. And, like the timeline is kind of short, and like, it\u2019s your own two hands. And you get to the end of it, and you\u2019re like, here\u2019s the thing that I made. \n\nAnd like, you know, as a young computer scientist, like you have that, and then you just sort of lose it over time. And so, like, it\u2019s really good for that. But like, the best thing that it does for you is it gives me a way to go talk to people who aren\u2019t computer scientists, because it\u2019s hard to like go to an artist and to strike up a rousing conversation about like, how great stochastic gradient descent is. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: I just want to pause here and point out how moving it is the way you\u2019re talking about art. Because not once have you said, so social connection, also a mode of personal expression with a sort of \u2013 not \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say outcome, but a connection to that which you\u2019re creating. Not once did you talk about aesthetics, good art, bad art. \n\nBecause if there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s been helpful about all the debates about AI and art, honestly, is that it did upend the professional art world and the tastemakers and all of that, because the aesthetics about what makes for good or bad art, you know, according to those traits, are so culturally specific and historical.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Absolutely.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: But I love, so I really wanted to \u2013 I wanted to just \u2013 the teacher in me is like, that\u2019s a note worth pulling into relief, because the way you talked about what is fulfilling about art resonates with the way people understand, not just personal expression or even social commentary, which, for some is, or even art for art\u2019s sake, which is almost impossible to do anyway. \n\nBut art is not even just a reflection of the world, but also constitutive of it. You are creating your own worlds and different ways of thinking. I\u2019m sure that shapes the work and life that you have. And that\u2019s usually how people do \u2013 I mean, to me, that\u2019s a more meaningful way to value art.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and it\u2019s sort of funny, like you talk to artists, and like, artists, I think, have a hard time defining exactly what art is. So like, forget about good art and bad art, but like, what is it? \n\nAnd to me, and I \u2013 like, this isn\u2019t me even saying this is what it must be; it\u2019s just how I think about it. Art feels to me like this thing that you have in you that you need to express, that you don\u2019t have any other way to express, but like, it has to get out. Like, you \u2013 you gotta. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: I hear that. It\u2019s like a calling. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And, you know, there\u2019s other parties in this transaction. So, like you sort of put this thing out there, and then you have a whole bunch of other people that are going to connect to you through this thing that you\u2019ve tried to express. \n\nAnd like, whether or not they get what it is that you were expressing, to the extent you even know what it was that you were expressing, like the important thing is like, there\u2019s a connection, like there\u2019s a conversation that you can now have about, like this very squishy thing. And, you know, the catalyst for the conversation is like, you know, some artifact that you\u2019ve made. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: I think that\u2019s \u2013 think about how you just talked about this right now. Well, which was, you said squishy. And at Stanford, it\u2019s fuzzy. But actually, you were very articulate about what it is. It just doesn\u2019t fall into the same calculations or certain kind of vocabularies that engineering does. \n\nBut Toni Morrison has this great line where she says, where she writes her, you know, the novels, and then she sends them out into the world like children. So there\u2019ll be people who value it, or e-value it, or there\u2019s valuations of the work you do, or is there aesthetics. But you\u2019re right, the artists themselves, sometimes they can name what they\u2019re doing. There\u2019s fabulous people who can. But it\u2019s not required necessarily. And I think you\u2019re absolutely right.\n\nBut that\u2019s part of also sometimes how people dismiss artists. They\u2019re like, oh, they\u2019re just out there, you know, in a little Parisian Atelier, just doing their little thing. So we need better ways to talk about it and to revalue it.\n\nThe way you talked about Japan appreciating a tradition, if it\u2019s built into institutions where we, it seems to me, allow space, funding, you know, culturally, even parks, like creating or, you know, it costs money to create art, you know, a lot of times, so \u2013 not that we have to think about the economics of it, but we haven\u2019t talked about this at all, but I\u2019m hoping at some point, and we \u2013 and I know we\u2019re almost out of time, but, you know, talking about the value of art and then the conditions for art are so important, because all the debates, as you know, about the SAG-AFTRA debates \u2013 or the strikes and the copyright compensation, all of that, it\u2019s in the background of all of this. I think. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and I think it\u2019s a super important conversation. And like, if \u2013 I\u2019m sure there are many, many, many parts, but at least two of the parts are, like there\u2019s sort of the \u2013 there\u2019s the economics of art and creativity. Like, what\u2019s the business model for it? Like, how does it get funded? Like, how can you choose to be an artist and have a career? \n\nAnd I think it is perfectly rational for everyone who has discovered a business model that empowers their creativity, for them to say, like I am not interested in having this upended on me without any input from me, because, you know, like I\u2019m just a human being, like trying to have a life and to, you know, like earn a living from this thing that I\u2019ve invested so much of my time and energy getting good at. Like that\u2019s perfectly natural and real. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s like, you know, this other question, which is, you know, okay, well, we have AI, and AI \u2013 I don\u2019t even want to use the word, \u201ccan do art,\u201d because I don\u2019t think it actually can. But it can \u2013 you know, it is, at the very least, like a new tool in the repertoire of artists. \n\nAnd, you know, I think there\u2019s a question people have around, you know, whether the existence of this new tool, does that demean what it \u2013 what they do, like, artistically? Not economically, but, you know, like, does it take away the value of this thing that I do? And I think there, like the \u2013 the answer is, like, absolutely not.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: Okay. I actually would agree with you. I think it is much more similar to a paint brush, and there\u2019s a very long history of technology and artistic creation than to \u2013 what you mentioned, the \u2013 the \u201ccan it do art,\u201d and that takes us right into the, you know, these debates about, what is art, what is great art? To me, I\u2019m pretty sanguine about that. \n\nThat\u2019s the other question, actually, that has obsessed me lately is not \u2013 because \u2013 is not, can it do art, or is it like a simulacrum of, you know, artistic expression, or is it cannibalizing other artists\u2019 livelihood and \u2013 and future of work, of course all super important. \n\nBut also to me, what is art isn\u2019t an abstract question, because historically, you know, I always think about like, who and why is asking? You know, why is that question posed? \n\nAnd I \u2013 a friend of mine was pointing out, you know, Thomas Jefferson very infamously said, you know, he\u2019d never heard, I\u2019m paraphrasing, a black person utter a line of poetry or a blob of narrative, you know. And not just because he was opining about the biological status and abilities of black people, but also there was an antislavery bill that he was supportive of, but it actually included the notion that black people were not culturally or physiologically advanced enough to become part of the polity. \n\nSo \u2013 and he used \u2013 if art is an index of the level of humanity, which it has been for a very long time, was seen as the apex of, like sophisticated cultures and so on, then that question, which should seem sort of moot, actually I always think about like, how \u2013 where is that being used or mobilized? Like, what \u2013 not to get, you know, wonky or anything, but like, why is it really mattering to people? Are they anxious that AI, you know, is gonna \u2013 or algorithms are gonna steal future work? Are they anxious because it looks like it\u2019s the last Turing Test of humanity is artistic expression? \n\nOr is it sometimes, I mean, for me at least, I feel like the pace of technology, not just the pace of technology, but the way we\u2019re all supposed to speed up and have this seamless user experience and not pop, that feels a rub against artistic creation, the way you\u2019ve talked about it, too, the value of taking time, of pausing, of reading a book, which takes a really long time, that I just want to hold those together in the same space somehow. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. You said something a few minutes ago, which I think is really, really important. Like, we are maybe more than homo techne, like we are, you know, whatever, you know, the Latin \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: Technosapiens was his term.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Yeah. Like we\u2019re \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: Storytellers.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 storytellers. \n\nAnd, you know, like, one of the interesting things about art is, you know, you can have a Japanese tea bowl, for instance, and it can be, you know, a vitrified hunk of mud, if you look at it one way, or it can be like this thing that has a rich tradition that\u2019s centuries old and, like, just a \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: It\u2019s resonating.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 fascinating history around, you know, all of the different ways, and all of the, you know, sort of artistic and social reasons that, like things got made the way that they were made. \n\nAnd you have people even today who just invest an enormous amount of their soul into making these objects, not because they\u2019re interested in making a vitrified clump of mud that you can put some green powder in and, like sip some liquid out of. It\u2019s like the story around it. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: Yes!\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s about Buddhism and nature and, you know, like state of mind, and like harmony.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: I love what you just pointed out of the multiplicity of narratives with even an object. Because when we say storytelling, it\u2019s not just one cultural narrative. It\u2019s \u2013 and it\u2019s not even just everything subjective. It\u2019s that \u2013 it\u2019s almost like a palimpsest of all these different kinds of storytellings. I completely\u2013 and storytelling that is a function of both the thing itself and also the viewer, which I think is just so \u2013 you know, we co-create the meaning of the objects we create. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, \n\nMICHELE ELAM: I love your description of that, Kevin.\n.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And sort of, you know, back to AI, so, you know, the \u2013 the object itself is relatively uninteresting, absent the humans. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: For sure.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And the two interesting things to me about the humans relative to the object is you have a craftsperson who, you know, went to extraordinary lengths to make this thing, and it\u2019s less about the thing than the extraordinary lengths that the person went to make it. And then there\u2019s the story that surrounds the whole thing. \n\nLike, that\u2019s what makes it compelling. Because if you didn\u2019t have those two things, then, you know, like, it\u2019s, you know, kind of borderline indistinguishable from some random rock that, you know, rain hollowed a pit out in. And, you know, it\u2019s like we impute the meaning on these things.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: Completely. And sometimes the meaning is shaped by marketing, like we\u2019re going to tell you what this thing is important to you. And then humans, just as you said, we co-create the meaning of it too. \n\nI do think of the Eliza Effect of the way we will insist on meaning in the things that we create, even when we know the meaning doesn\u2019t necessarily just reside in it, which I find fascinating, potentially problematic, because we can be profoundly manipulated by those things, obviously, but also something very poignant to me, that we\u2019re meaning-making creatures. You know, I love that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, that \u2013 that\u2019s why, like I am obviously at a whole bunch of different ways worried about the bad or the unintended stuff that our tools can let us, like intentionally or unintentionally, get up to. \n\nAnd \u2013 but like, I also, on the other hand, like I\u2019m not too worried about, like having our human dignity stripped away from us, because, like we\u2019re you know, like our dignity is a thing that we have, and like it is, you know, our interactions with one another, and, you know, like the stories that we tell each other that create all of this meaning. And so, you know, AI absent that is, to me, like, completely uninteresting.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: Yeah, it\u2019s interesting. You know when I was thinking of ghost workers, and the way in which certain practices, of course, in AI development or whatever, does have this invisible underclass, and it can actually strip the dignity away of some people, so paying attention to that. \n\nBut I agree with you, I\u2019m not worried \u2013 maybe some people are more worried than me \u2013 that it\u2019s going to be sentient in a way that we are concerned it\u2019s going to, you know, upend us or \u2013 I\u2019m not in that apocalyptic camp, for instance. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, in the very least, like we should refuse to let it, like for \u2013\n\nMICHELE ELAM: Well, you know, there\u2019s plenty of people out there, and you know them all, who are like, well, let it be what it is, is we brought this into the world, and it\u2019s gonna do its own thing. \n\nTo go back to my dad, finally, who would absolutely have loved you, is we can\u2019t always anticipate, you know, obviously second use or third use. We can\u2019t always \u2013 human in the loop isn\u2019t sufficient, because who knows when that, you know, when we\u2019re in the loop, or how belatedly. Humans have been in the loop for a lot of technologies that have done a lot of damage, so it\u2019s much more complicated than that. But at least being alert to those things, I think is very important, because it has such great potential, obviously. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: And you work in some of that, I think for some things around climate change or about food scarcity. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Health care.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: Oh my gosh, like amazing, right? So I wouldn\u2019t want to forget that.\n\nOr enhancing and augmenting creativity, not taking over it, obviously, but that\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it, I\u2019ve seen AI, particularly in terms of literature, as a useful interlocutor. I do think it needs to be, you know, in the same way we\u2019re having a conversation, if I quote you, which I probably will, I will say, I will credit you. So I think that\u2019s also important, too. I\u2019m thinking of students now, of recognizing when you\u2019ve drawn on AI to write a paper. We haven\u2019t even gone there. \n\nWe\u2019ll have to talk about AI and education sometimes with your \u2013 in the future, with your \u2013 your students, your kids who are growing up right in the thick of all of those ethical issues, that I\u2019m sure all the colleges, and high school probably, right, even now are having to deal with. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Yeah, we could talk for hours about that, I\u2019m sure. \n\nSo we are well and truly out of time. I have one last question for you before we go, which I ask everyone. So you know, you have such a interesting job, and like a broad range of interests. I\u2019m just curious what you do outside of work for fun.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: I read. I read. Because it\u2019s so rare to spend time with a book. We were just \u2013 I was talking with one of your producers before. I hope I\u2019m not outing her. Said her favorite thing to do is to take a book into the bathtub. And I actually, besides the fact that a hard copy book is \u2013 can be tricky and get wet, if you notice, there\u2019s like a lot of books behind me. I\u2019m almost entombed by all these books. \n\nIt\u2019s a luxury, it feels like, to take the time, to authorize myself to take the time to sit down with a book in a quiet space. It is meditative. So I have \u2013 that is what I\u2019ve been doing. You\u2019d think as a literature professor, I would be doing that all along, but I forgot the pleasures of unrushed, unhurried reading. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. It\u2019s funny you say that. So my wife, by training, is a historian, and like, she and I both dropped out of our PhD programs at about the same time. \n\nAnd one of the things for her that was a benefit of not being in academia was she enjoyed reading again, because, like, she \u2013 you know, she had like, 2,000 pages of, you know, material to read every week as a history PhD student, and like, the only thing she would allow herself to read were, like the important things that were part of her professional development, and she stopped reading for fun.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: Yeah, speedreading. It doesn\u2019t count. No.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So I\u2019m delighted to hear that, like you read for fun.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: But I want my students to do \u2013 I\u2019ve assigned less, not shorter pieces, but it takes longer to read a novel. I want them to enjoy it again. It\u2019s terrible that in academe we kill the joy of something that brought us into it to begin with, so I make sure my students can as well. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome.\n\nMICHELE ELAM: It\u2019s so lovely talking with you always. My head\u2019s buzzing with thoughts.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, we \u2013 I could have spent easy another like two hours. So thank you so much for taking the time, and it was a lovely conversation. Good to catch up. \n\nMICHELE ELAM: Thank you. Wonderful talking with you as well.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nWhat a great conversation with Michele Elam. I really could have gone another couple of hours with her. And this is, by the way, how all of my conversations go with Michele, so many interesting things to chat about. \n\nYou know, one of the things that really stood out to me about our conversation is, like this notion of how important narrative and storytelling is, and how we understand technology and how we understand technology\u2019s relationship to us.\n\nYou know, I think Michele has got a really fantastic take on some of the thorniest issues with AI, and like, part of that is ensuring that, you know, us as storytelling beings, how we really understand the technology of AI as a tool and really sort of inspect how it is that that tool is helping to shape the stories that we\u2019re telling so that we can have more agency in evolving those stories and not having things get away from us. \n\nYou know, there were a whole bunch of other things that we chatted about in that conversation that were really great, and I absolutely am going to take Michele up on her offer to spend more time with her students, who I think are asking all of the important questions right now about how this technology is unfolding and like what its role ought to be in the world. And so, I\u2019m just sort of excited to chat with more young people, with artists, with writers, with creatives of all sorts, to, you know, hear how they\u2019re thinking about things. \n\nSo that\u2019s all of our time today.
