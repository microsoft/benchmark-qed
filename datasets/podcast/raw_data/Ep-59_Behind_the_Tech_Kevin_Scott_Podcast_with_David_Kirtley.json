And that\u2019s where I got the bug and said, like, whoa, not only can we do space propulsion, that\u2019s great, with this physics and engineering, but maybe we actually have a chance to do fusion on timescales that are relevant for humanity, relevant for me, personally, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we\u2019re going to get behind the tech. We\u2019ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what\u2019s happening today. Stick around.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello, and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Cohost, Christina Warren, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And today we are bringing you a conversation with someone who is at the forefront of the future of energy, David Kirtley, who is a Cofounder and CEO at Helion.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I\u2019ve gotten to know David, over the past few years, you know, first because, you know, just out of general interest for cool things like fusion generators, I got an opportunity to tour their facility and to see the machine that they were building. \n\nAnd then Microsoft has been partnering with Helion to try to figure out how we can be the first consumer of the energy that their first reactor produces, which is enormously useful to us. Obviously, we use energy in our data centers. And we need that energy to be clean and sustainable and as cheap as possible in order for us to deliver all the cloud computing to all of the customers who need it.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, definitely. And I\u2019m super-excited that, a) you know that we are working with companies like this, and also, frankly, that there are still companies that are doing this sort of research, because when we talk about the future of energy, I think that fusion sometimes gets the short end of the stick. And I personally think that it\u2019s a really important area for us to be building towards. And so I think that I\u2019m glad that people like David are out there and that we\u2019re working towards this.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And I think you it\u2019s not just getting sustainable energy, which is super important, obviously. But the idea that we may be inventing a technology right now and like close to actually having fusion, after doing so much research and so much engineering over many, many, many decades, really opens up the possibility that we may be able to have more energy abundance than we have had in many decades, which I think helps us solve so many problems that we have, and it\u2019s going to be surprising in ways that people don\u2019t even anticipate fully, like once we have it.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, definitely. Well, let\u2019s go ahead and get into this conversation with David.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Dr. David Kirtley is the Cofounder and CEO of Helion, a privately funded nuclear fusion company. David\u2019s passionate about inventing and developing disruptive technologies that will improve access to energy, reduce carbon emissions and provide a better future. He\u2019s a Fellow of the National Science Foundation, NASA and the Department of Defense. \n\nNow he\u2019s a leading expert in field reverse configuration fusion generators and leads a team working to build the world\u2019s first fusion power plant. Just this year, we announced that Helion is going to provide Microsoft fusion power starting in 2028. \n\nDavid, welcome to the podcast. Thanks for joining me today. \n\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Thank you very much. It\u2019s great to be here.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So I start each one of these conversations by asking my guest, how it is they got interested in science and technology in the first place. And so I\u2019d just be curious, like when you first got the spark, and what that looked like, what, you know, what encouraged and just, you know, how you got on this journey?\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah, that\u2019s wonderful. So I actually look back and can point to a couple of parts in my history. I grew up in the military, and in the Navy, actually. My father was in the Navy. Every three years, we moved somewhere new. And one of the places that we lived was Bermuda, Naval Air Station, Bermuda, you know, kind of a great place to be a 10- and 11-year-old and \u2013 but it was under the flight path of the space shuttle that would launch out of Florida. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, wow.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: And so at night, you can see, when they did these night launches, this man-made comet flying through, above you, and just lighting up the sky and looking like, \"Hey, we humans built this thing. There are people up there and they\u2019re going into space, like technology can do this thing. I want to follow this, but I don\u2019t know how to apply it yet.\" \n\nInterestingly, the next sort of big spark came in high school, where I was in physics in high school, AP Physics, and my physics teacher was a particle physicist who had been working for many years in Texas on the supercollider there. And this is when I learned math and physics for real, and calculus and all those key \u2013 those core things that \u2013 you know, that define your ability to solve these problems. And it was always applied. It wasn\u2019t, let\u2019s learn force and acceleration. It was: let\u2019s understand how rollercoasters work. \n\nIt\u2019s let\u2019s not learn thermodynamics, it\u2019s let\u2019s understand how fireworks and chemistry through fire, and those kinds of things. And started to see, like the universe is, you know, is based off of math and physics, and it\u2019s digestible, you can understand it, you can learn the rules, and then it makes sense. And you can apply those to do new things. \n\nSo the two of those, both the scale of what humans are capable of, and then the understanding of the mathematics behind it all really got me very excited about this. And then that also got me into energy and understanding the energy problem and how it applies to humanity, and how maybe we can work to make that better.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Super cool. Well, so let\u2019s, I want to talk about your teacher for a minute. Like, do you know how a particle physicist wound up teaching high school?\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yep. So it \u2013 this is also an interesting lesson in that it ties back to some of the things we do as a private company in a space dominated by large academic and national lab infrastructure projects, is that, a particle accelerator, the superconducting supercollider, that was going to be this massive thing in North Texas, and it was going to be a very large project to do really amazing physics. \n\nAnd it sort of got so big, my understanding now\u2014I didn\u2019t really understand at the time\u2014it got so big and took so many years that it sort of like crumbled under the political weight of trying to deploy massive amounts of capital for this huge project. And then other things like land rights and regulatory requirements, and other things probably added to that. But even now, I don\u2019t really see the whole picture there. \n\nAnd so he, as far as I\u2019m aware, moved to Texas to be able to support this and work on that project. And then while it was taking the years, started teaching physics at a high school, and then fell in love with that, also.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s unbelievably amazing, actually, like, I wish more kids had that option. Because I do think, you know, I\u2019d be curious on your take on this. \n\nOne of the one of the things I see with my own children, and like I saw it with myself, although I didn\u2019t recognize it when it was happening is like sometimes you get into these, like really great feedback loops personally, where you find a thing that\u2019s interesting, and you kind of good at it, maybe you\u2019re not the best at it, but like you\u2019re good enough, and you\u2019re excited enough about it, where you learn more, you do more, and by doing you get better at the thing. \n\nAnd the better you get, like, the easier it is, and like the more excited you get, the more, you know, accomplishment you feel. And like the sooner you get those cycles going, and like the more you can turn the crank, I think the more you can ultimately achieve. And so it\u2019s really fantastic when kids get the cycle started. \n\nLike I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ve experienced that yourself, or you\u2019ve seen it in other people, but like I just, you know, the phenomenon, even with like, you know, prodigies and things like piano, like sometimes I think \u2013 it\u2019s about talent. And sometimes it\u2019s about like, you know, you just have the right set of conditions to start the feedback cycle where you get, like you get very quickly up to this level of competence, because you\u2019re just practicing so much.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah, I think that sort of like, I look back at my history, and I have visual of, you know, like a flower unfolding. As you open it up, there\u2019s more and more things as the petals open, that you get \u2013 it\u2019s more complex, it\u2019s more interesting. And so in this case, for instance, like I can\u2019t even be \u2013 there\u2019s a specific memory here where we\u2019re learning F equals MA, force, mass and acceleration, right? \n\nAnd but it doesn\u2019t \u2013 so they\u2019re all abstract thought processes. What is acceleration? And what is gravity, and what is gravitational potential energy? And all of those things, and as you start to look at the application, okay. Roller coasters are a good one, where there\u2019s acceleration of gravity and energy and conversion of kinetic to gravitational potential. Like all of that is wonderful. But you say, \"Well, great, well, how am I going to measure that?\u201d\n\nAs you learn about accelerometers, and then you need to program those accelerometers. And then you learn about data acquisition. And \u2013 but it has to be handheld, so you can get on the roller coaster and you actually do it. And then afterwards, you analyze the data, and you learn about signal to noise in the data. And all of those things just like keep compounding and getting more interesting, and \u2013 and make you want to spend more time doing it. \n\nAnd then you have to learn the mathematics behind why all that works. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: And then you start to learn, okay, well, what is gravity, and then you \u2013 and then, you know it just unfolds this \u2013 this physical understanding of like the universe, but you also get passionate and excited about it. I think about that with my own child, of looking for the things that are sparking him, without trying to like, push him into a specific category. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Right.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Because it has to be downhill, it has to. It has to snowball, and the energy has to go into the passion of understanding and growing and getting better and better at it, rather than someone pushing you into it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I had this moment with my daughter, this week, my 15-year-old, where she is just obsessed with Chemistry and Biology and Medicine, and she just had this moment. Like, literally last night, she was sitting down doing some Science homework, and she was excited about it in exactly the way I remember at 15 years old, being excited about programming computers and Computer Science. \n\nAnd you know, and I told her, I was like, you know, \"I think it\u2019s wonderful, kid, that like you found this thing at 15,\" because I realize in retrospect, how lucky I was to have found my thing when I was 12. And it wasn\u2019t about me being talented. It was like about me, you know, again getting into that positive feedback loop pretty early, almost by good fortune. \n\nSo I had this other thing I wanted to ask you. I still haven\u2019t seen the Christopher Nolan Oppenheimer movie, but I did go watch the Oppenheimer documentary about his life. And, you know, one of the interesting things in that documentary is that he started off his PhD program at Cambridge, trying to be a lab physicist, and was just evidently miserable at it, like hated it. Like wasn\u2019t very good. And he wound up going off G\u00f6ttingen to be a theoretical physicist, you know, and so like, he found the right mentor and like found the right space.\n\nAnd like, there is this cliquishness, I find, it\u2019s definitely in computer science. I think it\u2019s in physics and the physical sciences as well, where there\u2019s this real divide between theoreticians and, like folks who do applied work. And like, I\u2019ve always been more on the applied side myself, like I get motivated to learn the theory by finding a problem hard enough that demands that you understand the theory that goes solve the problem, but like, the thing that really excites me is like, here\u2019s a gnarly problem, we\u2019ve got to go solve. \n\nAnd other people are like, really motivated by like living in the abstract. You know, like, I think Feynman was one of those guys where, you know, like, he just like had this, you know, intellectual life where he could imagine worlds in his head and like, get really excited about that. And you know, not saying he didn\u2019t go solve real problems as well. But like, do you think that that exists? Have you experienced that as a physicist in your own career?\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah, I think that \u2013 I think about it as \u2013 we actually as this as an interview question, typically. And we ask it in a number of ways, but there\u2019s a Venn diagram of how \u2013 how much do you gravitate towards theory, experimental, or hardware and computation?\n\nAnd we actually put them in three individual buckets of different versions of applied and different benefits. And typically at Helion we hire people that can do a little of all of them. Like that\u2019s a pretty hard requirement that you can do some. And then we ask, essentially, like, \"Tell me about where you\u2019ve been in your career? Have you been focused on hardware or theory or computation? But now where do you want to go? What is what drives you? What\u2019s your passion? What get \u2013 what do you wake up in the morning thinking, like, \u2018Oh, I want to go build this thing, or I want to learn more on the theory of the things I\u2019ve been building for my PhD work,\u2019\" or whatever. \n\nAnd so \u2013 so yeah, I definitely see that, and different people gravitate towards different things, and to build real systems you need all of that, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Correct.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: You have to have theory, otherwise you\u2019re not going to build a thing that works. You have to have simulation, so you can \u2013 you don\u2019t just have to trial and error everything, or use empirical studies for everything that, because you have that mix. And so I think that\u2019s true. \n\nIn fact, in my background, you know, we haven\u2019t talked about this too much, and we can. But when I got into fusion, I got into it as that applied, the desire to build and test these things. And I struggled early actually, because it was so theory, and so far out in timeline and an application. And I had to actually take a pause in my career and fusion to look at it, and decide, you know, what do really I want to focus on?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and it\u2019s so interesting. Sometimes people, I think, beat themselves up, because, and I think PhD programs sort of do this to you, like, you know, many, many, many PhD programs, like, convince you that, you know, that the thing you need to do is sort of this singular individual accomplishment, like it\u2019s your project and your thing and almost anything useful that you\u2019re going to do in the real world is like lots of people working on very complicated problems that are too big for one person to solve alone. \n\nAnd when you get into that mode, you get this new superpower of teams, where you can have the person that\u2019s a better theoretician, and a person who\u2019s better at the hardware, and a person who loves to run experiments in the lab, and a person who likes to write the code, and you can build that complementarity inside of a team where you\u2019ve got all of your bases covered, and you don\u2019t have to be all of that in one person. And like, I know, a lot of people who waste a lot of time beating themselves up because they\u2019re not good at a thing. \n\nOr they just naturally gravitate away from certain things, and then just feel guilty about, like not giving service to this other thing that they think is important, which is to me, a horrendous waste of time.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah. I mean, it comes back to, I think, the first part of this conversation around finding that thing \u2013 you\u2019re passionate and going down that path. So yeah, and I think that the other thing that I have seen in some of these programs, mine particularly also, is a push to do the singular new thing, not only on your own, but that is totally isolated and isn\u2019t built on the work of others.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Right.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: But the vast knowledge of humanity we\u2019ve been building up over these years. So then you\u2019re almost forced into something that isn\u2019t going to have, you know, that applied value. I think that\u2019s something that, you know, at Helion, we \u2013 with our fusion systems, we have looked at, they\u2019re built on physics and engineering, that go back to the \u201850s. And it needed new electronics and new fiber optics and all kinds of new technologies to be able to build the systems people have theorized, but it wasn\u2019t us starting from scratch. \n\nAnd I think that, you know, the famous quote, standing on the shoulders of giants, lets you move a lot faster, and add real value to humanity quicker. And that\u2019s something maybe early in my career, like, thinking about the space shuttle, and those massive programs with, I don\u2019t know, thousands or tens of thousands of engineers and scientists that came together for those big projects to have a deliverable. And I think that I still think back to those sometimes. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: And when I talk about thinking about how I build teams at Helion.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and some of these programs that we did, in the space race in particular, were just unfathomable in scale. Like, there was a really good YouTube video bio for this YouTuber called his channel is Smarter Every Day. \n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And, like, super good engineer who, like makes great STEM content and he was interviewing a NASA engineer who had worked on the Saturn V program. And you know, there\u2019s more than 100,000 people working on that program to like build this rocket that would be able to transport a moon lander, like all the way to the moon and like get someone back safely. \n\nAnd it just \u2013 crazy complexity of that thing. And like they\u2019re building it at a time where they have a tiny fraction of the scientific and engineering resources that we have right now. So I like I\u2019m always in awe that like a) you got 100,000 people \u2013 although, like \u2013 you know, Microsoft\u2019s, like, bigger than that. It\u2019s always amazing to me that you can get, you know, people to \u2013 large, large \u2013 large groups of people to do very complicated things, but it\u2019s so impressive, some of those past projects.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: And I think I think about that in the scale of the project, but also the time. Like we went, you know, if you think about where we went from, you know, only a tiny, little rockets launched, blowing \u2013 essentially blowing up on \u2013 there wasn\u2019t even a pad yet \u2013 to lots of humans, massive scale infrastructure, and then humans like actually delivering that, you know, being \u2013 landing on the moon in that short time. \n\nAnd we\u2019ve had lots of other projects to where, you know we move fast, where you start with a singular mission of \"I have a time limit. And I better do this.\" I mean, you use the word race.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: I think that\u2019s a big, important key.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: And I think that applies if you to fusion in some ways to in that the time pressure on fusion is here. Like we need it. The world needs it. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: And so now you actually see people getting into this with that race mentality of how do we deliver this thing fast, and you didn\u2019t make engineering choices based off of speed, not always based off of the optimal engineering, but based off of what can deliver the mission, the product deliverable as fast as possible.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and so I want to get to fusion and Helion in just a minute, but I want to ask you one more question. So you had this amazing, high school teacher who helped spark your interest in physics? Like, how did you go from, like, very interested, high school student to \u2013 you know, I\u2019m guessing you majored in Physics and undergrad, you got a PhD in Physics? Like, what was that path? Like, you know, how was your journey through college? And like, what was your first job as a physicist?\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah, so I, interestingly \u2013 so yeah, I \u2013 in high school, I got the bug of, you know, I want to go down this Applied Engineering and Physics path. And I want to solve a big problem. Okay. That\u2019s not unusual for a high schooler. And then \u2013 but I had now access to, to the resources to say, \"Well, what does that mean?\" And so I looked, at the time, at the world and said, \"We need to solve energy. We need to get away from oil,\u201d not necessarily for climate change reasons at the time, but for all the geopolitics reasons.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, when was this?\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: So that would have been in high school in the \u201890s.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Okay.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: In the \u201890s, and then \u2013 you know, and you look at the universe, and the universe is \u2013 fundamentally most, if not all the energy, comes from fusion, and you know in some long inefficient way even oil comes from the plants that were powered by fusion and decay and the energy came from there and was stored from fusion energy originally from the sun. And so you looked at that, and you say, \"Great, we should be able to do that. Humankind can solve these huge problems; we can solve this one too,\" and \u2013 but tried to figure out how to get to that path. \n\nSo I wanted \u2013 so then I got the bug of plasma physics, and learning about the sun and astronomy and cosmology and stellar physics, and plasmas, but in an applied way, and so even early, I was thinking about plasmas and plasma thrusters and fusion, and all of those types of things with the eventual goal of like, okay, I want to \u2013 I want to master this fusion thing, but I don\u2019t even know how to get into it. \n\nAnd so, interestingly, though, at the time, I actually couldn\u2019t afford college, and so, to go to the schools that I knew we were the ones that could do this. And so, I actually spent two years at a smaller school in Texas, University of Texas, Dallas, smaller school, learning electrical engineering, learning some of the core engineering and physics around this with the goal of, like, I knew what I wanted to get to, but I knew these were the steps. \n\nI spent two years there, and then spent two years finishing my bachelor\u2019s degree at the University of Michigan, and went off and started \u2013 at that point was doing research in the plasma physics. This was in aerospace engineering with a focus on the plasma physics with plasma thrusters, and then working in the nuclear engineering department on fusion, in fact, antimatter-based fusion. So, we call that muon catalyzed fusion. And so, my first technical paper was there as an undergrad in antimatter based fusion. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Nice. \n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: And then I kind of reached a crisis in my career, where I looked at where I was looking at my career going. And I wrote this awesome paper and learned all this physics around fusion and saw all the paths at the time, and looked at this and said, man, we\u2019re not going to materialize this in my lifetime, maybe. Like, when is the first electron on the grid coming from fusion? And it\u2019s not clear that even the machines I would work on would be able to deliver that before I retired, maybe even in my lifetime. \n\nAnd so, I said, great, well, I\u2019ve learned what I need to learn. Like, fusion is not ready for me yet. I\u2019m going to pivot away from that, take my pause of physics, and go build thrusters, go build spacecraft. So, I went and worked, left after my bachelor\u2019s degree, worked for the Air Force Research Labs building spacecraft thrusters. In fact, some of the thrusters I worked on were the predecessors to what\u2019s on Starlink now, those Hall-effect thrusters, and some big high power things and some fusion related technologies as well. \n\nI went back to graduate school, got masters degrees in nuclear engineering, more plasma physics, more aerospace engineering. And that\u2019s when I really got into fusion, or I kept expanding that plasma physics knowledge. But it wasn\u2019t until later, after the PhD, after I was doing all this plasma physics work and, you know, the core around fusion, but applied towards thrusters, and some amount of maybe you could do fusion in space work, too, that I met the core team at Helion, where we \u2013 I learned about some engineering ways that maybe can vastly speed up fusion. \n\nAnd that\u2019s where I got the bug and said, like, whoa, not only can we do space propulsion, that\u2019s great, with this physics and engineering, but maybe we actually have a chance to do fusion on timescales that are relevant for humanity, relevant for me, personally, right? Frankly, it\u2019s relevant for me personally. And that\u2019s \u2013 we were able to build those early machines, do fusion. And then I said, great, let\u2019s go do this. And we focused all of our efforts on forming Helion and moving from there.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, did your work on Hall-effect thrusters, like \u2013 so, for sure, one of the most important things about building a fusion reactor is being able to manipulate magnetic fields. And I\u2019m guessing a Hall-effect thruster is manipulating magnetic fields to generate thrust. So, like, how much of, like, this pathway of learning that you had, like, are your early projects influencing things that you\u2019re doing now?\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah, absolutely critical. In fact, a lot of the earliest work, I worked on Hall-effect thrusters, but I also worked on very large scale, pulsed plasma thrusters, where you\u2019re now taking a \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, yeah.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Taking a fuel, you\u2019re ionizing it into a high temperature plasma. You\u2019re super heating it up to 100,000 degrees, or maybe even a million degrees, but then you accelerate, you push it out of the thruster into space. And that\u2019s what gives you your Newton\u2019s Laws, gives you your thrust, and then that pushes the spacecraft. And they can be very, very efficient, but here\u2019s the catch, in terms of efficient, in terms of mass.\n\nSo, you use a little bit of propellant to get a lot of acceleration out of it, but now it\u2019s all electrical. And so, you have to be really careful that you\u2019re electrically doing things efficiently. You\u2019re ionizing efficiently. You\u2019re harnessing the magnetic fields, and you\u2019re not wasting any. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: And so, that\u2019s where that application of how can you do the most efficient engineering, because in a spacecraft, you don\u2019t have power. You\u2019re getting power from the sun. It\u2019s hard; solar panels are heavy and expensive. So, you have to save every single watt, joule of energy that\u2019s coming to that spacecraft. And applying that to fusion, it turns out, is actually one of the ways to do fusion a lot faster \u2013 is if you can be efficient on all that. Hall-effect thrusters the same. You have magnetic fields that are insulating and protecting the thruster itself from this very high temperature fuel. And the J x B \u2013 the magnetic force \u2013 is what gives you the acceleration from that faster.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So, I think that\u2019s actually a perfect segue. We\u2019ve been dancing around this whole thing. You build fusion reactors. Like, explain to us how your reactor works.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yep. Yeah, so our fusion generators, there\u2019s a couple of techniques of fusion, very high level magnetic fusion, which is a steady version of fusion, large superconductors, like a tokamak that holds on to fusion long enough that it superheats, and then fusion can happen. It ignites, and then you use that heat to boil water and run a steam turbine. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s inertial fusion, where you do a similar thing, but in a pulsed way, in a nanosecond. I think about it as similar to a supernova, but in a nanosecond, you compress a fusion fuel. The leading way to do that is with lasers. It gets super high pressure, super high pressure where fusion happens. And then if you did your work right, it ignites, which means you get massive amounts of fusion power output, again, mostly in heat. Boiled water runs steam turbines.\n\nWhat we do is something that takes some of those, the best of both, the physics of both, but then new engineering to do what we call direct energy recovery. So, we take our fuel, trap it in a magnetic field that keeps it all protected, like in a Hall thruster or in a plasma thruster. And then rather than holding on to it forever until it ignites, we just squeeze it with magnetic field, squeeze it as fast as we can. Fusion happens, pushes back on that magnetic field. \n\nAnd now, I regenerate \u2013 I directly recover that electricity from that magnetic field back to recharge my systems in the same way that for a thruster, I want to be as efficient as possible. And every electron, and every joule and every watt, I want to do that in fusion, too. The key is what we found is if you can be really efficient on the engineering and do really good engineering, you get to do less physics. The fusion physics is the hard part. And I want to minimize that, so that I can build fusion systems smaller, cheaper, and all of those things.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yep. And so, like, by contrast, like, the way that we\u2019ve generated nuclear power for a while now for, like, powering the electric power grid has been fission reactors, where you basically put fissile material together. Like, they get very hot, and then you generate steam that turns turbines correctly, or correct. \n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Exactly, exactly. You get the hot rocks that boil water, and very, very good at releasing heat, which is both the positive and the challenge, and then, and use that to boil water, like, we know how to do, and then power the grid. And we \u2013 I think about it almost as: the way we do fusion is like jumping over the combustion engine and going right to the electric car, where you are efficient in terms of electricity through that whole process. So, you can get more of whatever you need. And for us, that\u2019s electricity out. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, I want to talk more about the engineering and technology. But I guess, you know, an interesting question for everyone is, like, why start a fusion power company? Like, we\u2019ve been trying to build fusion reactors since when, the 1960s, maybe, maybe earlier? And we have, I think there\u2019s this sort of joke that physicists make where, you know, like, fusion\u2019s always been 30 years away. Like, every year, you want to ask when it\u2019s coming. \n\nAnd so, like, we just haven\u2019t made a ton of progress over many, many decades of doing this. And, like, most of the efforts that we\u2019ve had, you know, to your point, have been, you know, big things like the National Ignition Facility, or, you know, this thing that \u2013 the tokamak that they\u2019re building in Europe right now, so, like, big, gigantic projects that have not yet yielded a commercially viable fusion reactor. Like, what gave you the confidence that you were going to be able to go build a company, raise the capital, and, like, build a thing that you were going to be able to make commercially viable?\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah, that comes to, interestingly enough, I think that comes or goes all the way back to high school to that student in high school of, I have to build it to believe it. And I want to test a theory. And yeah, sure, I just read it in a textbook, but I\u2019m going to go build that thing. And I\u2019m going to get on the roller coaster, and I\u2019m going to measure it. \n\nAnd so, for us, we, in the lab \u2013 and in that case, the lab was a small warehouse \u2013 had these series. In fact, a lot of it, you can trace back to the 1950s, first published paper of this magnetic compression, and some of the recovery is in 1958, really great work done, and \u2013 but before the transistor was commercialized. And we\u2019re talking about pulsed-electrical currency. So, it\u2019s pretty wild, what people were able to demonstrate even then. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yep.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: And in those systems, those small systems, and these were funded by the federal government, so I\u2019m all supportive of all the research money we can put into fusion, because we wouldn\u2019t be here without it, small research projects, but literally in a small system that was 10 feet long, and that I helped build and, like, actually turned the wrenches to assemble the thing. \n\nWe built a small system that did exactly this, made a plasma, super-heated it up to thermonuclear fusion conditions. Fusion happened, we saw it push back the magnetic field. We measured fusion reactions, we measured fusion particles. We measured a lot of it, and we did that on the program that was, like, a million and a half dollars, but was outperforming every \u2013 certainly every private fusion company that had come before, but then most of the National Labs, even up to the billion dollar scale lab.\n\nAnd we said, look, wow, okay, we\u2019re seeing an approach that, like, can do fusion at scale, fusion at a really interesting scale, still not at commercial scale, but for three orders of magnitude less money. Maybe, this is something I learned at the Air Force, working on those spacecraft programs, is that if the research, you can directly tie the final cost of whatever the deliverable is to what the research cost is, and that it only goes up. (Laughter.) As you start to build more complex systems, and make them reliable and then make them deliverable, cost continues to go up. \n\nSo, if you can do the research at a million dollars, you can now deliver fusion systems at competitive rates, where if you\u2019re doing the research at a billion dollars, the commercial system is in trouble already. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: And so, it\u2019s great, but that\u2019s not scale yet. We\u2019ve got to go figure out how to scale this. That\u2019s not \u2013 we haven\u2019t proven it in the engineering or the business case. We\u2019ve got it. We\u2019ll figure those things out, too. \n\nSo, we spent a couple more years doing the financial modeling, and the scaling modeling of, like, what does a generator look like? What does a power plant look like with this approach, assuming everything still works as we scale? And both the \u2013 have done, been demonstrated thermonuclear fusion, measured fusion reactions, scientifically validated and peer reviewed, and all of those things, plus a real clear commercial path, if all \u2013 if we could hit our milestones on the way, enable us to go and spin off Helion, raise venture capital. \n\nAnd luckily enough, we\u2019ve had some really good venture capitalists, Mithril Capital, and then Y Combinator to help grow that technology that were good believer in what we were doing, and then started hitting milestones. It took three more machines for us to build now the full-scale fusion system, like we did and published about a year and a half ago, our Trenta system that then got to full fusion conditions, over 100 million degrees is fusions at a commercial scale.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, one of the things that really impressed me the first time I saw that machine is just the number of engineering challenges that you had to solve. I mean, like, it\u2019s a complex machine. And so, you know, to your point earlier, it\u2019s not just about a bunch of partial differential equations or \u2013 and, like, I\u2019m sure the computer simulation piece of this is all also, you know, very interesting and telling you, you know what do you build and how you characterize things, and whatnot, but just the sheer scope of, like, the little nitty gritty engineering problems.\n\nAnd the thing that impressed me about you all is, like, you just sort of took nothing for granted. Like, every piece of the system, like, has to be reflected upon and designed appropriately, and efficiencies wrung out of, and whatnot. And, you know, sometimes you can do amazing things by just making sure that you do every last piece of it meticulously. Like, how do you all approach that, because it, like, strikes me as this huge, multidisciplinary thing that you\u2019ve got to go do?\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah, it is a good question. And I think that\u2019s one thing, maybe that sets Helion apart, but it\u2019s one thing, at least, as we focused on from the beginning, is our approach to fusion directly and efficiently recovers all the electricity you put into it. So, you have to do less fusion, okay? But that means you have to very efficiently recover all that electricity, everywhere, so that you can minimize the fusion scale, the magnetic field, the coil sizes, all of those things. \n\nAnd so, from the beginning, we\u2019ve always been intentionally meticulous about every one of the \u2013 how the connectors are done, testing those connectors, making sure those connectors always work. And what\u2019s the limit of those? We do a lot of destructive testing to find limits. And so, that has been really important and baked into the company. \n\nAnd I think part of that comes from that coupling early of people that also worked in the space field, where it\u2019s similar. You\u2019re building a rocket. That engine has to lift everything that\u2019s on the rocket. And if there\u2019s one part of it, if a toilet seat on the rocket is really heavy, now the engine has to be bigger, which means you need more propellant to power that engine, which means you need bigger tanks, which are heavier. And, you know, you have this exponential increase in complexity and scale.\n\nAnd so, by minimizing that, you can, you know, shrink the scale, shrink the costs, shrink, in theory, the complexity, too. And then it turns out that bootstraps, which I didn\u2019t really appreciate early in my career, is that big giant machines are actually harder to make than smaller machines. And you say, like, okay, great. Yeah, it\u2019s 10 times bigger, it should be 10 times harder, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s 100 times harder. It\u2019s massive amounts harder.\n\nAnd if your capital, and as a business person now, where I\u2019ve taken on all those business rules, if you have to raise capital from different sources, or worse, international sources, and, like, a lot of what we\u2019re doing in fusion includes politics now, where there\u2019s politicians and other kinds of big things involved, like that, that have long timescales and the complexity, that you get so big that it just slows down. It gets too hard and too complex. \n\nAnd by going smaller, testing the small rocket early, getting good at it, proving those small systems, and then learning to build the big systems, you just move faster. And the systems end up being more reliable. And I wouldn\u2019t have predicted that early in my career.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And I think funny enough, like, that principle is true for most things. Like, everything that you just said is also true of building distributed systems, and, like, any kind of complex software system, or even organizations. Like, big is only a thing you should do if it\u2019s absolutely necessary, because there\u2019s a cost for big. Usually, it makes you slow and less focused and everything, you know, more, like, harder to lift, like the rocket. And, you know, so small is good if you can accomplish what you want to accomplish inside of the envelope of small. \n\nAnd so, I think it\u2019s actually one of the genius things about what you all are doing. Like, if you look at these efficient plants that we, you know, are attempting to build, like, they\u2019re just gigantic projects. They cost tens of billions of dollars to make one. And, like, they\u2019re at such a huge scale that, you know, and I\u2019m guessing part of, like, the reason they\u2019re at a huge scale is, like, you\u2019re trying to amortize the \u2013 like, you fall into sort of the reverse trap of what you just said. \n\nYou convince yourself that this thing is going to be expensive. And so, the only way you can really, you know, recover the cost of things, like, you\u2019ve got to build this giant thing that helps you amortize the, you know, the development and construction costs. And, yeah, but what you all are doing are building these things that are going to be much more compact, potentially, which is just genius, I think.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Thank you. Yeah, I think that \u2013 I think the way you said it is that you convince yourself of the outcome. And so, you get into a trap early. You say, you know, it doesn\u2019t matter what the control system of the cockpit weighs on my rocket, it\u2019s going to be huge rocket anyway. So then, you then just bake that in, that inefficiency into the system, where we try very hard not to, even from, you know, from the point of view of some anecdotes of where a lot of our magnetic coils are modular. They\u2019re made all the same. \n\nAnd in fact, not only are they made all the same, but they\u2019re made up of subcomponents. And those subcomponents are all the same. So, our given \u2013 we may have 100 magnetic coils that have four pieces each or four, like, main coil segments, but you end up making 400 of those segments. I mean, there\u2019s all kinds of manufacturing benefits for that. \n\nBut then the one I didn\u2019t really appreciate is that we break those segments into pieces, like, a human can pick up. And so, now, you get a delivery and a human picks it up and moves it over to the table. And when you have a big coil, I saw some \u2013 and one of the manufacturers I was visiting earlier this year, they were really proud of this 300 ton magnet they had developed. There was one unit, it was 300 tons. And it had \u2013 they developed a boat to move it around, and a specialty crane to move it around, and all those things.\n\nAnd I\u2019m like, I\u2019m just thinking internally like, this is slow, this is too slow. Like, you need to have this broken into little pieces. And every time we get to a decision point of, okay, great, I need a forklift to move this, it\u2019s like, whoa, are you sure we can\u2019t spend a little bit more engineering time, break this into a more modular piece? Sometimes you can\u2019t. Sometimes the physics demands that it just has to be this way. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and, you know, I think, too, you know, and this is another interesting thing that you all do. You know, sometimes you\u2019re building, like, very bespoke things. And sometimes, like, you are, like, taking things that are useful for not just building fusion reactors. \n\nSo, like, rather than having to go build a, you know, a new smelting process, a new metallurgy and, like, new whatever to build a 300 ton magnet, and you\u2019re going to make exactly one of these things ever. Like, you are, you know, building \u2013 you\u2019re using things where you can build lots of them, and, like, maybe other people can benefit from them as well. So, you\u2019ve got economies of scale in, like, the components of your system, which is fantastic.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah, and the way you make it, I think there was something I learned about rockets early in my career that just floored me, because I had \u2013 like, as an engineer, I had never thought about it, which is the way solid rocket boosters on the space shuttle. But then now, you know, the Falcon rockets, it\u2019s like, what sets the size? Oh, bigger rockets are better. They\u2019re more efficient. They\u2019re, you know, on and on, but in fact, there\u2019s a train tunnel you have to move this rocket through.\n\nAnd if you can\u2019t move the rocket through the train tunnel, then rather than having a factory that builds rockets, you have to make a factory each time you want to build a rocket. And it just radically changes the business model. And it changes the \u2013 your ability to learn and be reliable and low cost.\n\nAnd so, that \u2013 we think about that. Like, what\u2019s the biggest machine I\u2019ll ever make? It\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not in power. It\u2019s scaled by I have to fit one of these through a train tunnel. And that\u2019s the biggest one we\u2019ll ever make. And if we need more power, we\u2019ll put two of them, you know. And that that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s the way we design these, and we think about it. \n\nAnd then you build a factory, and people don\u2019t have to move every time you want to build another generator. You don\u2019t have to break ground every time you want to build a new generator. You just build the factory that ships those on site.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, so I want to jump up a level and talk about why fusion. So, and I think one of the things that most people miss is, like, obviously, you want fusion because it will give you a renewable source of energy. Like, we clearly have a problem with, like, our consumption of energy is releasing way too much carbon into the atmosphere. And, like, that\u2019s highly problematic for a whole bunch of reasons. You still have the same geopolitical problems that you were \u2013 you were talking about before. They haven\u2019t gone away. \n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But, like, I think the thing that people really miss, and, like, you probably have a better perspective on this than I do, is that starting somewhere in the 1970s, like, we just stopped using energy at the rate that we had been using it before. And, like, it\u2019s actually a staggering thing to think about, you know, not just, like, what happens if we can take the energy that we\u2019re consuming right now, and it\u2019s like, more sustainable. \n\nBut, like, what happens if, like, energy becomes sustainable, and cheap and abundant enough where you could use 100 times more, 1,000 times more or 10,000 times more of it than you\u2019re using right now? What\u2019s then possible? So, talk a little bit about, like, why energy matters?\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah, I think about this a lot, actually, and from two perspectives. One is just recently, we\u2019re starting to use more electricity. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re upticking, for the first time in a long time, where in the 1970s and \u201880s, we plateaued in a lot of ways, in terms of our energy use. I think that\u2019s totally right. \n\nBut recently, electric transportation, probably computation and AI kicks into that, too, and then looking at ways to solve climate change by spending electricity then goes in, and it\u2019s starting to increase our demand for electricity.\n\nAnd the other thing I tie to in this is standard of living directly ties with access to electricity, low-cost electricity. So, you look at different parts of the world and standard of living, and you can say, like, okay, great, they have more electricity access, they have more standard of living, however you want to define that. But I asked the same question, what happens if we had 10 times? Does that mean our standard of living would be 10 times? What does that mean? Would we have access to cleaner access to clean water. \n\nDesalination is the classic. There\u2019s a trigger at the one to two cent per kilowatt hour, where if you can have electricity at that cost, then now you can desalinate water through electrolysis and other methods directly. Clean water is now cheaper than it was to actually, like, pull it out of a river and purify it. And so, suddenly, you know, you enable some of those things, which are clear. \n\nBut I think through, you know, if you had, you know, the computational access, where you can have large scale servers at everybody\u2019s house, you\u2019ve got to get maybe the server price down. But now you can actually do really interesting things on the computation and the cooling around that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Look, I think the \u2013 one of the things that maybe people don\u2019t appreciate or think about clearly enough, is maybe everything good that has ever happened in the history of humankind is humans discovering new sources of energy, and being able to put that energy to work solving problems that benefit humans. \n\nAnd so, in a sense, like, you actually want to be able to consume more energy. You don\u2019t want the consumption of energy to be a bad thing, because nominally consuming more energy means you\u2019re doing more of those useful things for humanity, you know, like, electrolysis.\n\nLike, I mean, one of the things here in the state of California is, like, we have parts of the state where you have abundant water, and you have parts of the state where you have no water. And, like, one of the reasons that California is habitable is we spend an enormous amount of energy pumping water from places where it\u2019s abundant to places where it\u2019s scarce. And, like, I think you\u2019re going to have to do more of that in the future with climate change. \n\nSo, you know, you really do want a world where you have cheap, abundant energy, which is why I think the problem you\u2019re working on is \u2013 like, I think artificial intelligence is a pretty important problem. That\u2019s the thing I spend most of my time working on. But I think your problem is more important than my problem, and my problem is dependent on your problem. (Laughter.) \n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah, at some scale, your problem \u2013 our two problems work together. Yeah, I don\u2019t know that we know, frankly, what happens if you have more energy, more low-cost electricity, particularly once \u2013 it has to be low cost. That\u2019s really important. If it just costs a lot more and you have more of it, it doesn\u2019t actually help the situation where the essentially effective cost of burning wood to burning coal to fission power, and then to renewables that are \u2013 some of the renewables when you have access to good sunlight, solar power can be really low cost, does \u2013 you have these stage gates for humanity that you unlock.\n\nAnd so, I don\u2019t know that we know the answer to that, but I\u2019m excited to find out. That\u2019s for sure.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and we probably have two generations who\u2019ve never experienced, like, what it looks like when humanity is expanding its consumption of power. You know, so like, you just don\u2019t even have the pattern matching anymore for what it could look like, where you can just sort of think, it\u2019s like, all right, the availability of energy isn\u2019t the barrier for me attempting to go solve this problem. Like, I can think about that as, like, solved, and then I can make something else be the tough thing. \n\nAnyway, it\u2019s, like, incredibly exciting to think that we\u2019re as close as 2028 to having viable, cheap fusion energy and, like, a path to, like, making that ubiquitous. Like, it\u2019s just an incredible thing to contemplate.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: And I think some of it is not just access to electricity and energy and what it costs. But it\u2019s also maybe even more subtle: energy density. Like, why could we build cars? Well, because we could get energy dense enough to put in a tank that could \u2013 that you could burn it. Why could we build jets? Because you could get Jet A and, like, actually carry it around with you. \n\nEven electric cars, I point to the very first electric cars actually were before the combustion engine. In the 1800s, there were electric cars that had a five-mile range, but they were, you know, huge and inefficient. And they didn\u2019t \u2013 the batteries didn\u2019t work very well. There wasn\u2019t the transistor to drive a modern motor. There wasn\u2019t electromagnets. You know, all of those things didn\u2019t develop to where they are now. \n\nAnd now you can have really high energy density lithium batteries, compared to other batteries, anyway, and that gives you the range. And you have regenerative recovery of electricity, which gives you more range. And suddenly, it unlocks the 200 mile range, or whatever, that that was the thing, the threshold we needed for the commercial, electrification. Can you do the same thing with shipping? Can you do the same thing with aircraft? \n\nAnd so, if you can get energy, and energy density and electricity density, even, then maybe you\u2019ll be able to unlock some of those things.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: I think one thing, we talked about desalination and freshwater, but there\u2019s some other cool things, if you can go one more order of magnitude in cost, which is that dissolved in all seawater are molybdenum and rare earth metals, and all the things that we, like, go to very hard, as humans \u2013 I say \u201cwe,\u201d but humankind in general, go to long length to try to do to dig out of the ground and purify or recycle, even. Now you have lots more access to these things, and \u2013 and everybody has access to them. It just takes that amount of electricity to separate them out. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and maybe it gets you better access to space. And maybe it, like, gets you access to better material science. And, you know, like, there\u2019s just so many interesting things that it potentially unlocks. \n\nSo, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re almost out of time here. So, the last question I ask everyone, and it\u2019s sort of a weird question, because almost everyone I chat with has such interesting day jobs, is outside of your work, what do you do for fun? \n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah. Well, this time of year is one of my favorite times a year, and \u2013 and it\u2019s what I spend most of my time outside of work of \u2013 of especially work with my son, who\u2019s seven now, is Halloween. I love it, I love it. And we \u2013 we are now building animatronics, and we\u2019re working on lighting. And we\u2019re working on automation and some of the electrical and the structural. And then the reality of like, okay, we\u2019re going to build this thing, but it\u2019s fragile. And we\u2019re in Washington, so it rains and, like, shorts out. \n\nAnd so, this is my favorite time of year, and we just get to \u2013 get to engage. How does a smoke machine work? The physics of a smoke machine is fascinating.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Fascinating. So, you\u2019re atomizing glycerin, right?\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: That\u2019s right. You\u2019re not actually making smoke at all. You\u2019re atomizing glycerin, but it comes out warm. So then, you have to run it through a cooling bed to keep it in a vapor form or a semi-vapor form, but cool, so it condenses and stays on the ground. Really, really exciting physics and engineering tied into that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Dude, I bet that\u2019s amazing for your kiddo. So, like, that is yet another example of a good, applied engineering project, where he may not even be realizing that he\u2019s getting excited about pretty hardcore applied engineering, because it\u2019s all about Halloween. That\u2019s awesome.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah. So, that fun this time of year. And then a lot of time, we engage with the, like, sports teams, local sports teams. So, well, you know, my favorite is the Everett AquaSox, which is a local baseball team. And at this time of year, it\u2019s Everett Silvertips, which is a local hockey team. And then I got to go to see the Kraken, first \u2013 the Seattle Kraken, the National Hockey League team. \n\nSo, we get to engage with community in that way. And then also, it\u2019s great with a kid go to all these things, especially the minor league games. They\u2019re almost in some ways more fun. You watch two innings and then go run around on the field for two innings, and then two more innings, sitting in the chair, those kinds of things.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s awesome. Well, thank you so much for taking time out of your busy schedule to chat with us today. And thank you for what you\u2019re doing. Like, I think we all should be rooting for your success and everyone else who\u2019s working on these fusion programs. Like, I think it\u2019s an extremely important thing that humans solve at some point. And I\u2019m, like, very hopeful and optimistic about your team\u2019s ability to help get us further along the path than we are now.\n\nDAVID KIRTLEY: Awesome. Well, thank you very much, Kevin. It\u2019s been fun.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right, what an amazingly fascinating conversation with David Kirtley. So one thing I want us to kind of touch \u2013 to talk back on a little bit, we were talking before your interview about some of the potential that we have if we\u2019re inventing kind of this new form of energy and what can come from that. But I wanted to touch on something that David was talking about, which is building on the shoulder of giants. And I think that anytime we come to a new technology and kind of a new invention, it is obviously many times I think, coming from what has been built before, right? But I wanted to get your take on that, to hear you maybe talk a little bit more about how important it is for us to continue to build on the work that others have done and not just, you know, thinking that we have to be working in in silos?\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, well, look, I think the objective reality is that it\u2019s nonsense, that anybody is truly building anything from scratch. The whole of society is only possible because of this very principle that, you know, we just rely on people before us, and even people around us, solving problems in ways where, like, we don\u2019t have to think about every detail and go all the way back to scratch for everything that we\u2019re doing.\n\nYou know, you can expect phones to work and things to run when you plug them into the wall, that electricity is available, and you \u2013 like the number of assumptions and things that we take for granted is just there for us to use, to run our daily lives and to build new things, is like really amazing. \n\nAnd you know, I think it\u2019s an interesting thing about humans. I was saying at some events, I believe, just the other day, like we\u2019re incredibly capable, all of us at going from being completely amazed and surprised about a new invention to taking it completely for granted five minutes later. But I think that it\u2019s important, like being able to, from a respect and dignity standpoint, you don\u2019t want to be taking anything for granted, but like that ability to just sort of assume that things work, and then build on top of them is actually really important, because it\u2019s the only way that we get to more complex things. \n\nAnd then, you know, the humility that I think we all need to have, though, is sort of acknowledging in the way that David did, that you\u2019re not inventing the whole world from scratch.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That, like you only get to do what you\u2019re doing, because so many other people solved so many other hard problems before you even got the privilege of starting on the hard problem you\u2019re working on.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I think that\u2019s absolutely true. And kind of speaking of hard problems, I mean you talked about how in your own life that\u2019s something you\u2019ve been drawn towards, and obviously, that\u2019s been something that David\u2019s been drawn towards to. What do you think is just kind of the potential of, you know, finally solving this hard problem of things like, you know, fusion power? And we were talking before this interview started about what those implications could be. And you and David got into that a little bit. But I\u2019d like to kind of hear more from you, and what you think those implications are from solving these hard problems.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, look, I think there\u2019s sort of two parts of it. There\u2019s sort of the necessity part of it. And then there\u2019s the, you know, sort of optimistic and hopeful, expansive part of it. So the necessary part of it is, one way or the other, like, we have to get to sustainable clean sources of energy, and like, we have to have them be inside of the economic threshold of our current sources of energy. \n\nLike, if we don\u2019t have that, like, we don\u2019t have substitutes for the current consumption of energy that like make economic sense for everybody. Like, we\u2019re going to have a very, very challenging set of climate problems that are worse than the ones that we already have, which are not great. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Sure.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, you know, like, I think, you know, when you look at a thing like fusion, like you shouldn\u2019t be Pollyanna and just sort of pretend that it\u2019s going to happen on accident, because we\u2019ve tried very hard and, like, not gotten all the way there for many, many decades. \n\nBut like, you also shouldn\u2019t be rooting against it. Because if you don\u2019t have a solution, like fusion to the sustainable, clean energy problem, then we have a very challenging set of zero-sum problems in society that are like \u2013 I mean, like I don\u2019t think people don\u2019t realize how challenging they will be in the limit.\n\nAnd so like, that\u2019s the necessity part of it. But like once you get fusion, and it\u2019s cheap, and you can roll it out and everybody can have access to this cheap energy that isn\u2019t killing the planet. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I think it is going to be really, really amazing what we can do. David mentioned a few things like purifying or desalinating water with electrolysis. So you know, like, one of the problems we have right now is like clean drinking water for everyone. And it\u2019s just, you can\u2019t use electrolysis to do desalinization right now, because it\u2019s too expensive. But if you have cheap energy, you absolutely can do it. And to his point it gets, you know, cheap enough where it\u2019s easier to desalinate things than to pump the water out of the ground. \n\nAnd, like that is a really profoundly amazing thing to think about. And it is one of what is invariably going to be thousands or tens of thousands of things that seem impossible right now, or that haven\u2019t even entered anyone\u2019s imagination, because you just are pre-constraining what you believe is possible, based on the past five decades of like, fairly plateaued energy consumption. \n\nAnd like, the thing that I said to David is, I think, really true, like the reason that we get to live in the world that we live in today is because we have figured out how to take new sources of energy and translate them into, you know, doing things that humans want and need.\n\nYou know, everything from, you know, being able to live in hot environments with air conditioning to, you know, like having drinking water in very arid places to, you know, being able to move around the world relatively freely to, you know, just being able to take for granted, like all of the energy infrastructure. You\u2019ve got all of these machines that do all of these things for you in your day-to-day life, and you just, you know, don\u2019t even think about, you know how it is they work. \n\nSo all of that\u2019s been plateaued for about 50 years now. Like almost as long as I\u2019ve been alive. And I think, getting back to a world where we\u2019ve \u2013 because energy is, you know, cheap and clean, like we can start having imagination, again, about like what to do with energy intensity, is like really gonna be fascinating. \n\nSo I\u2019m with every fiber of my being I am rooting for the success of David\u2019s effort, and like all of the others like it. Like it\u2019s just going to be hopefully an amazing future that we will live to see.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I hope so. I\u2019m with you, I\u2019m right there with you, I\u2019m very excited and hopeful as well. \n\nAll right. Well, that\u2019s going to be all of our time we\u2019ve got for today.
