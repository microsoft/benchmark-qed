{"episode": "EP-63 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Mike Schroepfer", "text": "MIKE SCHROEPFER: \"Show me something. Give me data. Talk to me \u2013 a customer. Like, give me a prototype.\" Like, the more you can actually touch and feel it, or talk to a customer, the more you are actually burning down the question of like, \"Can we do this and do people want it?\" And that\u2019s like the two questions.\n[MUSIC]\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer and EVP of AI at Microsoft. Today, tech is part of nearly every aspect of our lives. We\u2019re in the early days of an AI revolution promising to transform our lived experiences as much as any technology ever has. On this podcast, we\u2019ll talk with the folks behind that technology and explore the motivations, passion, and curiosity driving them to create the tech shaping our world. Let\u2019s get started.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello, and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m co-host, Christina Warren, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And today, we are bringing you an interview with Mike Schroepfer, who spent many years at Meta, but is now working on some really exciting projects through his investment firm, Gigascale Capital, as well as some super interesting philanthropic work with Additional Ventures and the Carbon to Sea Initiative.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I have wanted to have Mike on the podcast for a while now because every time he and I chat about what he\u2019s doing now, I am incredibly enthused to have someone with the platform building and technical experience that Mike has, applying that same bag of tricks to some of these really gnarly problems that we have related to climate change. \n\nSo, I hope in our conversation with him, we\u2019re going to hear about some of those super fun things. But he can go on for hours and hours and hours about both the entrepreneurs and the tech that they\u2019re working on that seem like they have a real and huge potential to help us solve some of these really gnarly climate problems.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Which we need. I\u2019m glad we have people like him taking those things on. So, I\u2019m really looking forward to hearing this conversation.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: All right, let\u2019s get into it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Mike Schroepfer is the founder of and a partner at Gigascale Capital, an early-stage climate tech investment firm. In addition to his work with Gigascale, Mike started and serves on the board of the Carbon to Sea Initiative, is the founder of the philanthropic organization, Additional Ventures, and is a senior fellow at Meta, focused on artificial intelligence and the development of technical talent. \n\nMike led Meta\u2019s engineering teams from 2008 to 2022, and served as Chief Technology Officer from 2013 to 2022. He led the development of eight gigawatts of clean energy infrastructure, and technology and teams that enable Meta to scale to billions of people around the world, and make breakthroughs in fields like artificial intelligence and virtual reality. Mike holds a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree in computer science from Stanford University. \n \nMike, thanks so much for being on the show today.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Glad to be here. Kevin. Thanks for having me.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So you have had one of those legendary Silicon Valley careers. And I am going to ask you the same first question that I ask for everybody who\u2019s on the show, which is, how did you get interested in technology in the first place?\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: You know, I don\u2019t know that there was a singular origin story. I mean, I \u2013 in a funny twist of fate, I grew up in Boca Raton, Florida, which you know, people may know from two very different worlds. One is Seinfeld, who lampooned it with Del Boca Vista, and the other is obviously that was the birth of the IBM PC. \n\nSo if you read the origin stories of Microsoft, which you know well, you hear the stories of Bill, you know, flying into Miami airport and driving up to Boca Raton in the \u201880s to convince IBM to use DOS for their IBM PC. That was my hometown. I was there at that time, you know, as a kid. \n\nAnd so, you know, we had, at the career days at school, you know, someone from IBM would always show up and talk about computers. And my neighbor\u2019s dad worked at IBM and so they had a PC Junior, I remember because it had the amazing 16-color graphics, I think. We played King\u2019s Quest on that. So like, I think a lot of it was just like exposure plus video games.\n\nYou know, my neighbor had the IBM PC. We couldn\u2019t afford that, but we had a Commodore, you know, a VIC-20 and then a Commodore 64, which was the bomb. And you know, so kind of had just like earlier exposure to that. And that was as a young kid. And then as I got further on in school, you know, science and math was always really fun for me. And I think the real \"ah-ha\" was in high school, I had a chance to take a physics class. And like, this was just like \u2013 there was something about, like wait, with these five equations, I can explain how like objects move around in the world, and I can understand how light bends through a small pinhole?\n\nLike, it was just really fun. And I think that probably was the cincher on, like when I go to college, I want to do something in science or engineering, but I wasn\u2019t exactly sure yet, until I got to college, what I wanted to do.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And were your parents in science and technology?\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: They were not. They were in the radio business. They ran a really small little AM radio station. I actually had a FCC license to broadcast as soon as I was, you know, old enough to do it, because I would help them on nights and weekends, run the radio station. \n\nSo there was like some technology, like we had early CDs and things like that to kind of like help upgrade the radio station. And my dad was like very tech curious, liked gadgets and stuff, but neither of them had an engineering or science background.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s really interesting. A lot of people that are in our age range had a somewhat similar story. So like, they came of age, like right around the time the personal computing revolution was starting. And they also like, were \u2013 you know, teenagers or kids as video games were on their ascendancy. And like, those two things got many a computer science career underway. But I\u2019m sort of wondering, like, did you have role models, like in your schools? Like, was there any one person who was \u2013 because this is interesting. Like, I don\u2019t think I did. Like, I grew up in rural Central Virginia, and like, I can\u2019t point to one person.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: No one I knew. So it would be people I saw on TV or read about in books or things like that, but I\u2019m trying to think. And that is not to say like, I did this all myself. It\u2019s more like there wasn\u2019t the person who was like, \"Oh, I want to be like them when I grow up,\" that I knew in person. So \u2013 so, no.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: How did you get from Boca Raton to Palo Alto? Like, how did you choose Stanford?\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Well, I knew I wanted to do engineering, or I thought I wanted to do engineering, but I wasn\u2019t sure exactly. You know, when you\u2019re in high school, it\u2019s like what does engineering mean? And I liked computers. And so, you know, it was kind of basically just Stanford was kind of good at everything. They weren\u2019t as well known, but they \u2013 like, all the engineering disciplines, were good. They\u2019re actually good at most of the humanities, too. \n\nSo I was kind of like \u2013 and they didn\u2019t make you choose before you got there. It was like, \"Oh, this would be a great place for me to like, really understand which of these different disciplines.\" I looked at a couple, like all-engineering schools, and I was just like, I just \u2013 I don\u2019t know, what if I decide I want to do philosophy or something else? You know, and so that was really the drive. \n\nAnd I also just when I visited it, I did the little, like they have the \u2013 you know, after you get accepted you do the, like overnight visit, where you get to stay on campus, and I did it there and at Princeton, which was the other place I was considering. And like, they got me right. They got me like in a dorm with a bunch of nerds, and I was like, \"This is awesome. They\u2019re all nerds. They have Macs. We\u2019re talking about computers, like \u2013 and it\u2019s sunny out. Like, this is amazing.\" Like, clearly, if I had this opportunity, I\u2019d be a dummy not to take it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so what was it like once you got to Stanford? So when was this? This was like \u2013\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: It would be \u201893, 1993.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Gotcha. And so, like, that was a super interesting time at Stanford. So, like, just a bunch of stuff going on in Silicon Valley and like, a bunch of interesting people at Stanford. So what was that like?\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: I remember my freshman dorm. It\u2019s like one person down the hallway from me had a Apple Newton, do you remember the Newton?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, yeah.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Like pen-based computers.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I loved that device. \n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: \"Whoa, you have a Newton?!\" And it was just \u2013 for whatever reason, like the computers were backordered, but I, like brought my computer with me. So I had the first computer there. We didn\u2019t have internet in the dorms. We had dial-up and there was like a little computer room in the basement that actually had internet with among other things, had a NeXTcube in it. \n\nSo if you remember the old NeXT, because I think NeXT basically donated a bunch of computers to Stanford to try to get people to actually buy them. And so it was just like, \"Whoa, this is so cool. There\u2019s just, like, so much stuff to do here.\" And I kind of went through a \u2013 and you\u2019ll hear this theme throughout my life, like \u2013 how do I run experiments to figure out \u2013 like, I want to do engineering. What does that mean? Like, let me just start taking what\u2019s the closest proxy to this. And so I took the Intro to Computer Science class, the Intro to EE Class at the same quarter.\n\nYou know, because I\u2019m like, maybe I want to do electrical engineering and build computers and chips, or maybe I want to do the CS thing. And I kind of took them in parallel and \u2013 and both amazing classes, CS 106-A \u2013 E-80, I think it was \u2013 in EE, and I was like \u2013 by the end of E-80, we were like \u2013 we built like a counter, you know \u2013 or just like, we spent all this time \u2013 this is like hard to build circuits, and like every week in Computer Science, we were building something new.\n\nIt\u2019s like, \"Oh, here\u2019s a basically Google Maps directions thing. Here\u2019s like a blackjack game, like here\u2019s \u2026\" I was like, \"This is amazing. This is a very high-leverage tool,\" like, \"This is amazing: I sit in from of my computer, and then three days later, this new thing pops out of the other end that, like, is a fully useful piece of software.\u201d\n\nI was hooked at that point and like, that\u2019s what\u2019s kept me in the industry for like 25 years. It\u2019s just like that feeling of like, \"Whoa, nothing to, like, we made this thing,\" like, you know, that\u2019s a lot more fun than any other hobby I can think of.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I\u2019m going to want to get back to this in a minute, but I think, when you were at Meta, and I suspect even with what you are doing right now, certainly everything benefits from being able to operate at software speed, but it also at a certain level of scale, like you actually do have to think about the hardware again.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Oh, for sure.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Because you just can\u2019t, you know, pick off the shelf, like a quantity or form factor compute or networking or storage that meets the needs of the thing that you\u2019re trying to build. \n\nAnd so like, I totally understand \u2013 I mean, like, I kind of made the same decision myself, but then, you know, found myself much later in my career caring a lot about hardware again.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Yeah. Me too. And I \u2013 like we can talk, because you know, like again, it was \u2013 just a fortunate time, because like, the internet, you know, the World Wide Web. We already had Gopher, and a bunch of other things, and Telnet, and what was it, Usenet/NNTP, when I got there, but then, you know, the web obviously came out while I was at Stanford, and so that was just, like amazing, but on the hardware side, I agree with you.\n\nI mean, you know, when I joined Facebook, now Meta, in 2008, you know, those first couple of years \u2013 everyone thinks of Meta as a software company \u2013 and I was like, those first couple of years, like our biggest problem was the site was just growing so quickly that we had all these emergency fire drills, like we\u2019re literally going to run out of capacity and everything\u2019s going to crash. \n\nAnd so a combination of like software optimization and like, how do we uncork the like hardware growth rate thing? And as you well know, better than I, as well as I do, it\u2019s like, you can\u2019t just, like order a new datacenter and have it next week. You\u2019re like, \"Oh crap, we gotta \u2026\"\n\nAnd like, I remember in these conversations, it\u2019s like, \"Okay, we\u2019re going to build a datacenter,\" like we\u2019d have a 2- to 4-year, like lead time, between the go and \u2013 like, it\u2019s operational, like, how much capacity do you need? And I was like, \"I don\u2019t know,\" like it\u2019s so hard to predict that far in advance.\n\nSo like, we literally have to order steel now, and like buy some land. So like, you can\u2019t tell me this in nine months. You need to tell me now, how much we\u2019re building. And so like that was just a \u2013 like, and then we built, you know, lots of datacenters, and then we made another move into consumer hardware. \n\nAnd so I joke, I made two transitions, one from software to hardware. And then when we got into consumer hardware it was like, \"Oh, we\u2019ve been building datacenters. I know this hardware thing. This is easy.\" And it\u2019s like, \"Oh, no. No, no, no.\" It\u2019s a totally different game when \u2013 like, if the consumer returns the thing, you\u2019ve now lost a ton of money because, like, you just ate everything. \n\nAnd so making sure that they like it and there\u2019s customer support and your price \u2013 like, there\u2019s a whole different ballgame in consumer hardware. So it\u2019s like software, enterprise hardware, consumer hardware, in terms of like difficulty, I would say. And so that has been really fun and has actually informed a lot of like, in my climate-tech investing, we\u2019re investing mostly in hardware, and a lot of it is enterprise, but some of it\u2019s consumer. You know, we\u2019re selling products that your average person is going to buy. And so anyway, so we can talk a lot about that. It is definitely a shift and a lot of fun. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, there\u2019s sort of an interesting philosophical thing here. Like, I think one of the things that has made you so successful and the companies that you work for so successful is there is this underlying assumption that no matter what the problem is, or the thing that you\u2019re going to go tackle next, that you\u2019re going to be able to figure it out. But sometimes, like, you can let yourself be overconfident and, you know, managing that balance between confidence and overconfidence. \n\nAnd like you do have to be fearless. Like, if you are fearful, like you will never get anything done. And it\u2019s like one of the things I\u2019m most impressed by what you\u2019re doing right now, because some people look at this bundle of, you know, climate change issues and think that the problem is completely intractable. \n\nAnd yet you are, you know, just with great enthusiasm, you know, trying to leverage the best of this technological entrepreneurial mindset to try to fix things. \n\nBut so, like, how have you thought about this tension, like how do you temper your optimism with pragmatism?\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Yeah. I mean, I often describe myself as a grounded optimist or a practical optimist. I think, you know, the extreme of optimism is naivete. It\u2019s just like it actually doesn\u2019t work. So much of what you say is true, and I think \u2013 you know, there\u2019s this phrase, stop energy, which is like \u2013 you\u2019re like, \"Oh, Schrep, I have this idea!\" and you\u2019re like, \"Here\u2019s all the reasons you can\u2019t do that, or that\u2019s not going to work,\" right? \n\nStop energy is so easy. It\u2019s so easy to be a critic and say, \"I\u2019ve thought of 30 reasons this doesn\u2019t work.\" It\u2019s so much harder to basically say, \"Well, wait a second, let\u2019s think about this. Why would this work?\" And let\u2019s talk about the physical constraints that means that this is not possible, like do those exist? Are you positioned well in the market? Are you leveraging your strengths?\n\nLike all those things. It\u2019s a much more constructive conversation. And so, you know, the good news, and getting back to this hardware software thing is the fun thing about hardware is you can model a lot of things out on paper. You know, if I told you I wanted to build a chip with this much memory bandwidth and this many transistors, you can do some back-of-the-envelope, and you\u2019re like, \"Yeah, you can\u2019t fab that right now.\"\n\nSo you can \u2013 you can try to convince me all you want, but like TSMC can\u2019t make it, so \u2013 you know, or in AR/VR worlds, you have these headsets and a big challenge is you need to get the field of view to be big. So I have a big screen in front of me. \n\nWell, you can model like, \"All right, I\u2019ve got to get a photon from back here from some light engine. It\u2019s got to kind of bend around and hit my eye.\" There\u2019s like only so many ways to get that photon to bend around. And optics is really well understood in physics. So you can do like index of refraction. You can model \u2013 given the material we\u2019re using, the maximum field of view you can get is x, right? And I can tell you how many startup pitches I went through, where they\u2019re like, \"We\u2019re going to build it with this, using this thing.\" \n\nAnd we\u2019d sit there and we\u2019d be, like, \"Yeah, you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t, like it doesn\u2019t \u2013 you\u2019ve violated the laws of physics at this point.\u201d So I think \u2013 you\u2019re like, \"Are you violating the laws of physics?\" as like the starting point, you know? But there are plenty of products that don\u2019t violate the laws of physics. But you just \u2013 like, you don\u2019t understand your customer or you\u2019re \u2013 like, I think a lot of businesses try to go way too far out of their comfort zone.\n\nYou know, when Intel tried to make microscopes, like that didn\u2019t work out well, right? It\u2019s like very far from chips. And so you kind of always want to take one step, like, \"I know part of this business, I\u2019m just moving a little bit to the left,\" as opposed to, you know, I\u2019m switching industries entirely.\n\nSo there\u2019s a lot of questions like that you try to ask yourself. And the other thing I\u2019d say is \u2013 like, the constant question I ask is like, \"What\u2019s the cheapest, fastest, easiest experiment to learn more?\" \n\nCan I mock it up in cardboard? Can I go ask 30 people whether they want this thing? Can I build one in my garage?\n\nThis is the place where I think smart people really get themselves in trouble, is \u2013 like, you try to spend too much time imagining, and it\u2019s just like, \"Stop imagining. Go do. Like, show me something. Give me data. Talk to me \u2013 a customer. Like, give me a prototype.\" Like, the more you can actually touch and feel it, or talk to a customer, the more you are actually burning down the question of like, \"Can we do this and do people want it?\" And that\u2019s like the two questions. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. It\u2019s really interesting, I think there\u2019s a related thing with smart people where sometimes it\u2019s very enjoyable to wallow in complexity to, like, take a very hard thing, and like even to make it harder, and like, there\u2019s this joy you can get from \u2013 from spending cycles there. But like, those overly complicated things are almost never really useful.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: A hundred percent. I think \u2013 I often describe when I\u2019m working with people \u2013 I \u2013 this took me a long time to figure out, but I think there\u2019s complex-ifiers and there are simplifiers. There\u2019s someone you give a big, hard problem, they go, like, \"Here\u2019s 30 pages, but you really only need to understand 3 things.\" Like, \"Here\u2019s the three biggest things that matter here, and if you want to get into details, I got it, but like here\u2019s the thing.\" \n\nThere\u2019s other people that come out with, \"Here\u2019s 26 pages of detail. I\u2019ve covered every base on this thing.\" And you\u2019re like, \"That\u2019s not actually helpful. That\u2019s actually much worse.\" And like, I find simplifiers are a secret weapon of a lot of organizations. It\u2019s what we sought in our PMs at Meta. That\u2019s what I look for in the founders I back. And it, like repeatedly has been successful for me in finding people who take a big, complex gnarly thing, and say, \"But these are the only things that matter.\u201d\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, I feel like you\u2019re giving the listeners sage advice here, so like, you compound these things and they get very interesting. So folks who have high learning rate, who know how to, like, experiment quickly, who are simplifiers, like, you just sort of stack these together, and like those, really the union of those things are just superpowers.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Yeah, a hundred percent.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So let\u2019s go back to Stanford, so \u2013 you know, you\u2019re there in \u201893, you decide to take Computer Science over EE. What was the most interesting thing that you learned at Stanford? Like, whether class or something you learn from a friend, or an internship?\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Yeah. I mean, I think it gets back to your question on like, how do you have no fear about having to solve a problem, which is like, I think the best of computer science is like learning how to organize and decompose complicated things. \n\nIf you go back to like what is a data structure? What is an API, how do I layer things? How do I like -- okay, I can program in Python. I don\u2019t need to know what the machine is doing, but then I can \u2013 like, start to learn C. I can learn assembly language. I can \u2013 like, look at the transistors on the chip. \n\nThere\u2019s this very clean layering that allows me to abstract out complexity. And I think  that is probably by far and above the best skill, because it gets back to that simplifier/complexifier thing. It\u2019s like, in everything in life, you know, you have to be able to figure out how to do that, you know? If you\u2019re doing a climate tech investment, someone shows up with this magic box, this magic box in which air, water and electricity comes in the side and jet fuel comes out the other side. \n\nIt\u2019s like, \"Okay, I\u2019m going to pretend for a second, I don\u2019t even know how this box works. I just trust you it does.\" If it costs you \u2013 you know a thousand dollars a gallon to make that jet fuel, you do not have a business, right? So I don\u2019t even care how the box works, but if you come to me, and you say, \"I can make it for five bucks a gallon,\" it\u2019s like, \"Oh, now I have a bunch of questions about how that box works, and let\u2019s like tear about whether that box works, whether it scales, and can be reliable.\"\n\nAnd so, like, being able to sort of move at multiple levels of detail and move up and down is by far and above the best. I think CS, also in a weird way, teaches you \u2013 like, I had this feeling, even in the \u201890s. It was like, \"Wow, this field\u2019s moving so fast.\" Like, languages were showing up all the time. Chips were moving. And so it was like: the idea that you just, like, learn your thing, and then I spend the next 30 years applying my thing was not the lesson I got.\n\nThe lesson I got was like, \"You need to learn how to learn stuff, because the thing you just learned is going to be obsolete in like a year. And so if you want to have any longevity in this field, like you got to be constantly \u2013 you\u2019ve got to know the new language, the new framework, the new this, the new that.\u201d And so that kind of sense of like, \"All right, I just, like I \u2026 It\u2019s a meta process. I\u2019ve got to get good at learning. I\u2019ve got to get good at decomposing problems and like understanding what\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nAnd I feel like those skills, you know, I think everyone can do that, regardless of their talent, and their background, and their profession I mean, and I think those have served me incredibly well throughout my career.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I have another question I want to ask you, but like, I think the other thing that people underappreciate is that practicing learning makes it easier to learn. And so like, I feel like it\u2019s one of the unfair advantages that I got as a computer scientist because, yeah, like I\u2019ve always assumed the half-life of the technical stuff that\u2019s going into my head is very short. \n\nAnd so like, I\u2019m always \u2013 but it lets you learn a whole bunch of other stuff, you know, and I\u2019m guessing, in your case, it let you be fearless about going into climate investing. Like, even though, like you\u2019re just like, \"Okay, well, I know how to learn \u2013 like, I can go learn this stuff.\" \n\nObviously with humility, right, because it\u2019s very complicated, but I see it even with my children. Once they figure out that learning is fun and useful, then they\u2019re in the learning loop, and like it just sort of, you know, snowballs into something like very \u2013 you know, very interesting. \n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Yeah, exactly right. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So the other question I have for you about Stanford is was there a course that, like, brought everything together into like, \"Oh, my god, like I didn\u2019t realize \u2013 like I had this superpower to build something very complicated before,\" you know? Because some schools do it Mr. Miyagi style, you know, like, you\u2019re \"wax on, wax off,\" and then one day you\u2019re fighting in a karate tournament, and you didn\u2019t even know you were going to be able to do this thing. It\u2019s like maybe a compiler course or an operating system course, or a robotics course, or something.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 honestly, this is a crap answer, but it\u2019s like I loved so many of the classes in the curriculum, it\u2019s like hard to pick one. So I\u2019m going to pick several for different reasons. \n\nI think the thing that probably stands out is the Introductory Computer Science curriculum at Stanford, which is CS106A and B, or if you knew how to program when you got there, CS106X is phenomenal. And it\u2019s phenomenal because it does this layered approach where they sort of give you progressive revealing of more details. \n\nThey also make you do real projects, but the real secret sauce is they had undergrads as basically TAs, and it\u2019s this thing called the Section Leader Program. So you have undergrads grading the assignments and like grading the tests. Once you get through CS106A and B, you can become what\u2019s called a section leader, which I did very quickly. And this was just a \u2013 like, because it\u2019s one thing to learn something, it\u2019s another thing to have to teach it to other people. Holy cow. \n\nLike asking questions. You\u2019re like, \"Oh gosh, I guess I didn\u2019t understand that,\" you know? And then I eventually became a TA when I was a grad student and then I had to make assignments and like, that\u2019s another ball of wax \u2013 I gotta, from scratch -  like, \"How do I make an assignment that teaches people about, you know, data structures?\" \n\nSo like that whole process of, like leading, teaching, working with others, it was like, again, I think the fusion of the thing \u2013 like, because I haven\u2019t \u2013 you know, I\u2019m an engineer, I\u2019m a technologist by background, but \u2013 like, my career ended up being a lot more about people, actually \u2013 people plus technology. And I think that was the very beginning of the \u2013 like, \"Huh, like this is magic, because of all these people.\u201d You\u2019ve got all these really great motivated undergrads and they\u2019re excited to teach it to other undergrads. \n\nAnd like, it\u2019s sort of just magic. And so that was probably formative. And then there\u2019s, you know, a bunch of just the \u2013 like, it was just fun to \u2013 like, you\u2019re just peeling layers of the onion back. It\u2019s like, \"Oh, that\u2019s how that works! Oh, that\u2019s \u2026\" you know, networking, compilers, computer graphics, operating systems, like \u2013 even I took \u2013 they stopped doing assembly. It was no longer required, but I took it anyway, and we made this, like multitasker, on \u2013 you know, it was a 68k assembly modeled on a 68k.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Nice!\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: And that was really fun, too. And like \u2013 and there was a contest of how few instructions you could make one thing happen, and I spent a lot of time trying to win that contest. So there was a lot there that was just fun.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, you wrap up your time at Stanford, and then it\u2019s off to industry. How did you choose, \u2013 I\u2019m sure there were so many options, like all these startups, all these big companies. Like there was so much going on in the industry, you know, Stanford students \u2013 like, have this, like crazy privilege of being very highly sought after. So like, I\u2019m guessing you had the opportunity to do a gazillion different things. Like, how did you pick?\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Yeah, so, again, back to experiments. I definitely treated my internships, my summers, as like a chance to run high frequency experiments. So I was like, let me try lots of different things to just kind of dial in what it is I want. \n\nSo the first summer was honestly whatever I could get. As a freshman to sophomore, it\u2019s like \u2013 it\u2019s really hard to get internships. It was like, whoever will give me a job in tech, I\u2019ll do it. And I\u2019m working at Motorola back in Florida, amusingly in their \u2013 the factory where they made beepers, I was on the software team helping them with compilers and stuff. \n\nAnd then the next time I was like, \"I want startup experience.\" So I went to Austin to work for a company called Trilogy Software. That was about 100 people, you know, enterprise software, sort of boring software, but an exciting startup. \n\nAnd then, as I got further in my studies, I kind of hit my first love in computer science, which was computer graphics. I was just like, computer graphics is so cool. You just can make beautiful things. And we were like, ray tracing was a thing. And how do you make it look beautiful? \n\nSo my next job was at a computer graphics startup in Los Angeles, working on movies. \n\nAnd then the summer after that, I was like, \"that was really fun. Let me try doing computer graphics at a big company,\" so I actually interned at Apple on their QuickDraw 3D team, which \u2013 and this was the \u201890s of Apple, which was not a good time at Apple, and actually, my whole team \u2013 my whole project got cancelled while I was there that summer.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, no. \n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: And so that\u2019s a very funny story that we can talk about, you know, but \u2013 and then I was really into computer graphics. So the big industry conference is called SIGGRAPH, and so I went to SIGGRAPH that summer, and this is going to date me, but \u2013 like, because we were still kind of in the early days of the internet, there was literally like a resum\u00e9 board where you \u2013 like, put your resum\u00e9 up, and you like tack it up there, and then people \u2013 and so I was like, \"Oh, I\u2019ll put my resum\u00e9 up\" for when I graduate, because I was going to stay for an extra year and do my master\u2019s, so when I graduate next summer, I can get a job.\n\nAnd I get a call from a recruiter who\u2019s working on this small company that was doing computer graphics for movies. It was one of the main people in Industrial Light & Magic, and they were using kind of Macs to \u2013 like, do real-time special effects, and I was like, \"Well, that sounds interesting,\" so I went and I talked to them, and I thought I was going to be interviewing for a job, you know, in the next summer. And they\u2019re like, \"No, no, no, no, we want you to start right now. We\u2019re a startup, we can\u2019t wait a year.\"\n\nAnd so I decided to defer my master\u2019s degree because I was like, I was engineer number two with this little startup working on, you know, software for digital effects, which was kind of \u2013 felt like just the most amazing thing to me. So that\u2019s sort of how I started. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, talk about that a little bit. So like, I think both of those things are sort of fascinating experiences for someone in college to have, so like both \u2013 you know, getting your project canceled while you\u2019re an intern and, like, being employee number two at a startup. Like, they\u2019re just fascinating learning experiences for different things. And I\u2019m sure, like, valuable stuff for everything that you did after.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: You know, my recollection \u2013 this was \u201890 \u2013 I think it was \u201896 or \u201897 at Apple, and Apple was going through tough times. So they were sort of cutting projects here or there. And like about halfway through the summer, my manager, who was amazing, calls me into his office, and he\u2019s like, \"Hey, I want to talk to you.\"\n\nMy recollection of this conversation is something along the lines of, you know, \"Hey, so this whole project is going to get canceled. And everyone\u2019s going to get, like, reassigned or laid off. But don\u2019t worry, like, your internship basically is funded through the summer.\"\n\nSo it was like, \"I need you to come into the office and, like, do some stuff, but none of the code \u2013 we\u2019re going to throw away the project, so none of the code you\u2019ve written is going to be used for anything.\"\n \nAnd like, you would think as a \u2013 you know, 21- or whatever-year-old \u2013 it\u2019s like, come in for a couple of hours and like have the rest of the time off would be great. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That sounds awful.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: I was miserable. I was like probably the saddest, you know, I had been in any work context that I can remember, you know, because I was like, \"None of this matters,\" I\u2019m kind of like, \"I want to build stuff that people are using,\" but I \u2013 like, I was just told, like, it\u2019s impossible at this time.\n\nAnd so that, like, was a kind of a \u2013 just a linchpin in my mind of both \u2013 like, it really matters where you are, the macro really matters, economic conditions, how good the company is doing, and \u2013 like, wow, I \u2013 like, you know, I don\u2019t like sitting around. I like building stuff that people use. So that was one.\n\nAnd then the startup was a lot of fun, because it was \u2013 I joke, I like, constantly got handed tasks that I wasn\u2019t qualified for because there wasn\u2019t anyone else to do it, or I was stupid enough to volunteer, and so, it was just a chance to try a lot of different things, and you know, write a lot of code, and I think it also created this moment that is like seared in my brain, which is, \"Okay, it was used for a terrible movie,\" so I\u2019m just going to \u2013 I\u2019m just going to caveat that I don\u2019t think this is a great movie. I\u2019m going to offend a lot of Star Wars fans, but it was \u2013 so our software was used on The Phantom Menace, and they were making it at the time.\n\nAnd Skywalker \u2013 we were in Sausalito, which is up in Marin County, just north of the Golden Gate Bridge. ILM, at the time, was up in the corner of, like Lucas Ranch, just whatever, where they were just doing a bunch of the specs work, and so the founder of the company came up to me, and was like, \"Hey, the folks over at Lucas Ranch are like using the thing you\u2019ve been working on, and they need some help. Can you go over there and help them?\" \n\nAnd so here\u2019s me as like a 22-year-old, like driving my Honda Accord, or whatever it is, you know, over to Lucas Valley Ranch, like signing this NDA, which, like I always joke, was like somewhere in there was embedded \u2013 like, \"If you reveal anything, we have Jedis who will come get you,\" you know, and so you sign this thing and like, open the door and there\u2019s like figurines from the movie on a giant table in front of you and a bunch of people in front of their computers. \n\nAnd they were working on one of the palace scenes with Padm\u00e9. And they were using literally the code I had written, which was this system around motion tracking: How do you find an object in the scene and then apply effects to it? And it was just one of these, like, \"Holy crap, like, they\u2019re using my thing for this, like this is amazing!\" It was just like, again, back to \u2013 like, there\u2019s nothing better than this. There\u2019s no, like hobby, I can think of that\u2019s more fun than we\u2019re building this thing, and then someone else is using it to do something awesome. \n\nThat, more than anything, was a formative experience. And I think that the next lesson I learned \u2013 you know, the unfortunate thing is: this was an amazing company with great people. Our software was, like revolutionary. We were in a limited market. We, like kind of sold it to everyone doing special effects, which was, you know, 10 \u2013 20,000 people. \n\nAnd we kind of had this like \"now what?\" moment, you know, it\u2019s like, we struggled to try a bunch of different things. And again, back to the macro, like the macro conditions really matter. It\u2019s like great team, great company great this, but like, we\u2019re selling a product that there aren\u2019t enough customers for \u2013 and that eventually made things hard. And the company eventually sold and I decided to go off and do something else.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, so we don\u2019t have infinite amounts of time. Like, you\u2019ve done so much interesting stuff, so I\u2019m going to fast forward past, like a bunch of things, including, what you probably are most well-known for, which is your 15 years at Meta, but like \u2013 you know, maybe one thing there \u2013 like 15 years in Silicon Valley time is an awfully long time to be at one place. And you still are there as a senior fellow, so what is it about Facebook/Meta that held your attention for as long as it has?\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Yeah, I think it basically boils down to three things. One is it was never the same thing, the time I was there. When I joined, it was Facebook.com, fewer users than MySpace, you know, web-only, a hundred-ish engineers. You know, 15 years later, it\u2019s billions of people using our products. It\u2019s Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Oculus VR systems. It\u2019s an AI research lab, like \u2013 and it\u2019s a much bigger organization. \n\nSo you can imagine all the steps along the journey there. There was a lot \u2013 like, as we talked about earlier, how do I build a datacenter? How do I build four of them in parallel? How do I build 20 of them in parallel? How do we build a research lab? How do we sell consumer hardware? \n\nLike, all of these things were like, \"Whoa, this is like my graduate school. I get to learn about a bunch of things,\u201d so it was constantly and is constantly changing. \n\nNow \u2013 you know, even now, why am I still there? It\u2019s like, well, AI \u2013 you know \u2013 you know, we built PyTorch, which is the leading open-source, you know, framework with a great cooperation with Microsoft, huge partners in that, you know, and then Llama is sort of the leading open-source model out there. You know, I think it\u2019s been downloaded, like, 100 million times or something, and there\u2019s 19,000 forks of it. \n\nAnd so, it\u2019s like, hey, you know, if I can spend a little bit of my time and help build a technology, AI, launch language models that can be leveraged by a lot of people because it\u2019s open source, like, that seems like a worthy use of my time. So, and it\u2019s different than what we were doing five years ago.\n\nSo, it constantly changed, is number one. You know, number two is: love the people, you know, you know, Mark is just unbelievable. And there\u2019s a lot of lessons from him. But it\u2019s not just Mark. There\u2019s tons of brilliant people there. \n\nAnd then the third is, you know, this impact. So, great, I work on this AI model, but it\u2019s used by so many people. Like, that is a great way for me to, again, get back to: I do some work, we build something, a lot of people do awesome stuff with it. Like, that is, like, a throughline through my whole career. \n\nAnd so, yeah, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m still spending time.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: You know, and I think there\u2019s this other interesting thing, too, about your work. And even if we - like, you were CTO at Mozilla before - you know, before you went to Facebook. And so much of what you have done has been platform building. Like, you\u2019re building apparatus for other people to build on top of whether it\u2019s, like, Facebook\u2019s internal infrastructure or Facebook itself, Web infrastructure, like, you know, like, I hadn\u2019t heard this, you know, anecdote about your computer graphics startup experience before, but like, even that\u2019s, like, a piece of infrastructure that other people are using to build things. \n\nSo, what is it that has attracted you to making tools, and infrastructure, and systems and platforms?\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Yeah. I mean, just one small clarification. I was a VP of Engineering at Mozilla. We had  two amazing CTOs while I was there. So, I would hate for them to think I was them because they\u2019re amazing. But it\u2019s a really good question. \n\nThere\u2019s just something about it that intuitively, like, I just \u2013 I love the idea of leverage. I mean, technology is leverage. You know, I would always say that technology is one of those few things that removes constraints. So many problems in life, you know, like, the Economics 101 you take in high school or it\u2019s like, all right: you have a $100 city budget. You know, you can either fund the libraries or the police or the fire department, but you can\u2019t fund all three fully. Like, a lot of people live in a world every day where our problems are tradeoffs. I can do this or I can do that. \n\nAnd technology is one of the only things that\u2019s like, oh, hey, it\u2019s now half the price. (Laughter.) Like, these lithium ion batteries are actually 99% the price they were when they were, like, introduced on the market in 1991, 99% cheaper, like, 1% of the price. And they\u2019re still getting cheaper. And so, you\u2019re just like, huh, I show up with this thing, it\u2019s just, like, better. \nThat is awesome. And I think that there\u2019s, for whatever reason, I have a - I think I have a decent intuition. Like, platforms are hard because you - people like to think concretely. Like, okay, what exactly am I going to use this for? What\u2019s the product? Who\u2019s the customer? \n\nAnd so, when you\u2019re building a platform, you have to have a little bit of a leap of faith or an ability to believe, like, okay, here\u2019s what this is going to be used for. And I, for whatever reason, I think I\u2019m just pretty good at spotting, like, I think this is the need. And I think if we build this, people will use it.\n\nAnd I think, you know, if you look at my time at Meta, it\u2019s React, it\u2019s PyTorch. Like, those are the things that I\u2019m probably most proud of, because they\u2019re things used by millions of people around the world that, like, fit a need better than anything else out there. \n\nAnd so, just, I don\u2019t know what it is. I think I just have, like, a natural attraction to these lever points that just provide tremendous value for people.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So maybe this is the perfect segue to what you\u2019re doing now. So, in 2023, you co-founded Gigascale with Victoria and Evaline to invest in and, I\u2019m guessing, accelerate, the development of technologies that will help with climate change. And, like, I\u2019ve got to tell you, man, I\u2019m - every time I talk to you about what you\u2019re doing, like, I am so much more hopeful and optimistic about things than I was, like, the five seconds before I was talking to you. \n\nAnd so, I mean, I guess why focus your attention on this, which may be an obvious question...and what makes you think you can have leverage there?\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Yeah, that - that\u2019s the - yeah, let\u2019s have some real humility on this. \n\nSo I think, you know, it starts with why. And I think - I bet you a bunch of people watching this are sort of maybe thinking about this or struggling about this. So, I think it\u2019s an important point. And, like, it took me a while to figure out exactly what happened, but it was honestly during COVID. It was 2020. You know, the whole world was shut down, no cars on Alma Street here in Palo Alto, which is usually really busy. \n\nI had a weirdly - like, I work lots of hours. I had a weirdly, all of a sudden, extra time because of not driving the kids around to activities, you know, everything\u2019s on Zoom. So, we just, like, had a couple extra hours in the day. And like, it also just gave me this moment to reflect as the world was sort of in this crisis moment about like, what is my role in this world given everything we just talked about, like, tremendous opportunity and fortune. What am I going to do with it? \n\nAnd we\u2019d already been doing a bunch, as you do, philanthropic work in a variety of areas. But I was like, man, climate is this thing that\u2019s going - it\u2019s a platform problem. It\u2019s going to impact tens or hundreds of millions of people, and the people most impacted are the least equipped to deal with the impacts. And so, it\u2019s like, here I am with a bunch of resources. Like, isn\u2019t it just an obligation for me to go off and do this? \n\nThat\u2019s kind of where it started, and I started thinking it was going to be philanthropy. I was like, great, I\u2019m going to direct more of my time and attention to philanthropy, spend a lot of nights and weekends. And again, I got to have a learner\u2019s mind. It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know anything about this, so I\u2019m just going to learn really quickly about all of it. And that was a huge advantage, because I just didn\u2019t have all of the baggage from before. \n\nAnd that\u2019s where we end - you know, I started doing a bunch of philanthropic and then spinning out a nonprofit last year that\u2019s working on a form of ocean carbon capture and funding a bunch of early-stage science there. And then it was, again, back to high frequency experiments. So, it\u2019s like, okay, we\u2019re doing that. And then I kind of bumped into some entrepreneurs. Like, you\u2019re doing some really interesting stuff. \n\nAnd as I just went through it, I was like, look, we need to be spending trillions of dollars a year to rebuild our physical infrastructure, how we make energy, how we consume it, how we transport things, how we make food, how we live in buildings. That is not a problem that a government or philanthropy can tackle with direct investment. Like, you need the markets to basically \u2013 markets can do that. Markets can spend trillions of dollars a year. We spend about that in - you know, in oil and gas right now. And markets do that when there\u2019s money to be made. \n\nSo, I think that it was like, okay, great, where\u2019s the money to be made? And how do we take technological disruption, back to my, huh, this thing\u2019s now half the price it used to be. I can now disrupt an incumbent and they don\u2019t know it yet. \n\nThat\u2019s where I get excited. It\u2019s like, cool. We have new technology. We have these curves of batteries. We\u2019ve got genome sequencing. So, we\u2019re working on a vaccine for - for cattle to reduce their methane emissions. We\u2019ve got solar cells, all of these things on a massive cost down curve. And then you start asking your questions, like where are the disruptions there? And who are the people that are going to do it? \n\nSo, that\u2019s really the foundation of it. And then taking all of this experience and building hardware, teams, technology and using it to help, you know, when I find a great entrepreneur who\u2019s got, you know, Sarah Lamaison, who\u2019s building an electrochemical cell to make ethylene. So, when I\u2019m making the pipes in your building, instead of doing all this dirty, nasty stuff with fossil fuels and emitting all these things, I have this nice little cell that just has electricity coming in. And then I make the chemical.\n\nLike, and that\u2019s really cool, but the cooler part is like, we think we can do it cheaper. And so, like, the pitch to the customer is like, yeah, our thing\u2019s cheaper. And, oh yeah, it\u2019s also really good for the environment.\n\nAnd, like, that, I just get so excited about. And like, I just want to spend my nights and weekends helping Sarah, you know, crush it, because I think we have tons of things like that. And that is leveraging a bunch of technological curves that are happening very quickly.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, I think this thing that you said about capital investment in markets is very interesting. And I wonder a lot about how you make sure that you have the right incentives set up inside of the market, where the market is playing the right game, because, like, look, you could spend trillions of dollars a year, and if you are not spending it efficiently, like, getting it into the hands of the people who are most likely to make the big, disruptive breakthroughs to, you know, sort of encourage the right set of things, which is not inventing stuff, it\u2019s like inventing stuff and then deploying it at scale and, like, making the unit economics of everything work.\n\nI\u2019m a big believer in markets, and I think markets can help. Like, maybe it\u2019s the best, you know, top-level mechanism for making sure that the capital gets allocated efficiently. But is that a thing that you worry about?\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Yeah. And I think we\u2019re at different levels of maturity at different sort of technological stacks here. And so, I think you\u2019ve got to kind of attack the problem from both sides, meaning I can disrupt the market because my technology innovation is now half the price of the incumbents\u2019. And so, my low carbon thing is just cheaper than the high carbon thing because of technological advancements. \n\nLike, that\u2019s the easy button in, right? And then there are other places where you need to bootstrap it a bit, like maybe I\u2019m not cheaper yet, but when I 10x my scale, I am cheaper. And so, that\u2019s where you see incentives, you know, government incentives, whether it be an EV tax credit or getting charging capability set up or, you know, carbon emission taxes for, whether it\u2019s transport or aircraft or concrete or cement \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, steel. You know, I think there are places where the governments can accelerate those things, you know, and get them there. \n\nI think that the useful thing about, you know - I basically am doing both philanthropy and investing, and I very clearly separate them. And philanthropy is like, great, we\u2019re going to fund early stage science. We\u2019re going to fund policy work. The output of that is a public good. It\u2019s something that everyone can see and use. There\u2019s no money to be made here. \n\nAnd then in the investing hat, I\u2019m like, I\u2019m only going to invest in this company, because I think you have a business, right? You have a technology that, at scale, is fundamentally better or cheaper than the other alternatives out there.\n\nAnd what\u2019s surprising to me is, like, there was a question in my mind of like, is there a lot of those or not? And the answer is there\u2019s a lot, because there\u2019s so much inefficiency in the current market. I\u2019ll give you \u2013 you know, I talked about Dioxycle, which is making ethylene, you know, cheaper than high carbon alternatives. I\u2019ll give you two other really quick ones. \n\nArbor Energy, a bunch of SpaceX engineers, know how to make rocket engines and gas turbines, they\u2019re, like, huh, all this, like, forestry waste we\u2019re pulling out of the California forest because we want to try to prevent forest fires, like, all that stuff, like, either piles up and sits and rots, which makes methane, which is bad, or you put it into an old-school biofuel plant, which is kind of, like, a big, huge wood fire, terrible particulate pollution. \n\nThey\u2019re like, \u201cwe spent all this time doing these high pressure, high oxygen burn things. If we can build a high pressure, high oxygen burn, we can basically take that same fuel source and, like, out of it is water and a fairly pure stream of CO2. Water, we can actually do something with. That CO2, we can inject in the ground or use as an input to another chemical process. And by the way, we\u2019re making energy.\u201d\n\nSo, it\u2019s like \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 you can think of it as, like, energy-producing carbon capture. We capture carbon, and we make energy. And, like, that\u2019s kind of cool. \n\nYou know, and then you go in another direction with, like, a company we just invested in, Arch, and you say, look, we got heat pumps. I\u2019m trying to heat and cool my home, air conditioning and heating. This magic heat pump technology is just, like, strictly more efficient than everything else out there. For most consumers, if you do the math, you\u2019re like, it\u2019s a little bit more money up front, but in a certain \u2013 but your bills go down every month. \n\nAnd so, you ask yourself, why isn\u2019t everyone installing these? And you start going out and you talk to installers. And they can\u2019t answer simple questions. The consumer is like, okay, this thing is $5,000. This thing is $10,000. You say it\u2019s cheaper. How long does it take to pay back? And they go\u2026 [shrugs]\n\nSo, of course, everyone goes, \u201cI\u2019ll buy the cheap one.\u201d And so, now you have a software solution that can do all this for you. It\u2019s like, oh, your payback period is 37 months. Do you want to do this? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Like, hell, yeah, I want to do that. So, it\u2019s a massive inefficiency in the market you\u2019re attacking with technology. And, like \u2013 and at the other end of it, a whole bunch of people are going to make a bunch of money. Installers are installing more heat pumps. Consumers save money. Like, it\u2019s just good. \n\nThat\u2019s what gets me excited. It\u2019s like, every time I look at this, it\u2019s like, that\u2019s a pretty good opportunity right there. And we haven\u2019t even talked about the grid, which is a whole other thing, which we could spend another hour talking about.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, let\u2019s talk about the grid, actually, because I\u2019m sure on multiple dimensions, the grid is a source of concern for both of us. \n\nYou know, if you look forward a handful of years, the amount of energy that the world will need is just much higher than it is right now. And, like, you know, and you can even imagine worlds where if you had abundant, cheap, sustainable sources of energy, like, you really could change a whole bunch of things about the world. Like, you wouldn\u2019t have water scarcity anymore, like, you know, drinking water scarcity. \n\nBut like, the grid is, like, this sort of interesting thing. Like, given the current momentum, like, you\u2019re only going to have the electric power industry, like, build, you know, this amount of capacity in a particular way. Like, very few electric power companies, like the operators, like, have R&D functions. So, like, there\u2019s nobody really doing a ton of R&D about changing, like, how it is that you\u2019re actually doing generation. \n\nSo, talk about that. I mean, you must have thought about this way more deeply than I have.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Yeah. So, this is both a deep concern and a massive opportunity. (Laughter.) So I think that the - like, the short way to think about it is, like, electrical demand in the United States has been relatively flat, you know, over the last, like, two decades-ish or decade or so. And that\u2019s, like, good news because it basically means it\u2019s actually decoupled from GDP. So, we\u2019ve been using about the same amount of energy and growing our GDP, mostly because of technological efficiency, LED light bulbs, things like that, which is awesome. \n\nBut it also means we\u2019ve, like, lost the muscle on building lots of generation and distribution capacity. If you look at other countries, like China, they\u2019re, like, growing their grid capacity at a massive rate, much faster than the U.S. is. \n\nSo, you start with like, are there physical laws or limits? It\u2019s like, no, humanity can build this stuff really quickly. We just, for a variety of, you know, historical reasons plus choices plus regulations, aren\u2019t currently. So, it\u2019s like, okay, good news, not violating laws of physics. \n\nAnd then you say, okay, increase in demand, that\u2019s one side. We\u2019re building a lot more factories in the U.S. now. We have datacenters working on AI. Like, so that\u2019s creating increased demand. There\u2019s also this new set of supply that\u2019s very different than the old set, which is, like, wind and solar. \n\nSo, if you like, look at ERCOT, Texas\u2019s grid, you know, on noon, about 50% of their power is wind and solar. Wind and solar is amazing. It is the cheapest form of energy generation we have ever had as humanity, but it doesn\u2019t work 24/7. Everyone knows that. So, now I have this new variable production and this increasing in demand, which are both new to the grid, right, which creates disruption. Disruption equals startup opportunity.\n\nAnd there are so many different ways to attack this problem. And they\u2019re hard, but I\u2019m excited about it. On one level, grid storage is huge. If I\u2019ve got these - you know, installing a commercial grid solar array is the cheapest form of energy generation and the most likely to be delivered on time, on budget of any project we know how to build, because they\u2019re so simple. \n\nSo, like, people are building these at massive scales, you know. We\u2019re in the - we\u2019re getting close to $1 trillion of investment in this a year. And if I can then show up and say, oh, hey, I have this, like, thing I can put right next to your solar array that allows you to dispatch energy 24/7, and by the way, people will pay you more money \u2013 they do this in Texas \u2013 at 8 pm when it\u2019s peak power load; so, like, go ahead and charge the battery when energy is cheap and then discharge it when energy is really expensive, like, that\u2019s a really good business.\n\nAnd so, now there\u2019s a huge incentive for me to build grid storage in a way that 10 years ago, nobody cared. Nobody cares about grid storage and batteries. But, like, so now we have companies like Form Energy. It\u2019s like, huh, instead of using lithium ion batteries, I\u2019m going to use this iron oxide battery. It\u2019s really cheap to make. It\u2019s bigger, it\u2019s heavier, which doesn\u2019t really work for a car, but who cares? It\u2019s on a big concrete pad. It\u2019s super cheap. Like, that\u2019s going to be a great business. \n\nYou have a bunch of other people saying, huh, power lines are, like, rated statically, which means you rate them, on how much power you think they can hold. But, depending on how cool it is outside, you can probably put 30% more power safely through that. So, maybe let\u2019s just put sensors on the power line and say, like, it\u2019s cool to go 30% more power. It\u2019s fine. Like, magically, now I have more power. \n\nThere\u2019s other companies saying, like, superconductors now work. We can, like, 5x the amount of power through this line via superconductor.\n\nSo, there\u2019s so many different ways to attack that problem, and I think the disruption causes the opening for these business models to exist. If I had superconducting power lines 10 years ago, nobody would care. If I had a grid battery, nobody would care. They\u2019re now trillion dollar businesses, business opportunities waiting for people. \n\nAnd there\u2019s a lot of other, and then we didn\u2019t even talk about fusion, which is - I\u2019m really excited about. We\u2019re going to do multiple bets on fusion, but I \u2013 that, when you talk about AI datacenters and you\u2019re building your latest, greatest new datacenter, you know, if I tell you I can put a 250 megawatt facility right next to your datacenter on 20 acres, that requires no inputs or outputs, you know, literally, you don\u2019t even need a fuel line or anything, like, one tanker truck will fuel this thing for a year, you\u2019re like, yeah, I\u2019ll take that. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: So, you know, there\u2019s a lot to do that\u2019s really hard. I don\u2019t want to overstate, and I don\u2019t want to overstate my role, but like, part of my job is to, like, get behind and push. Like, can we get these things more and faster and more people thinking about this? And, like, that\u2019s the way forward.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So, I think that is an excellent place to and here with one last question. So, I ask everybody who comes on the podcast what it is that they do in their spare time for fun. You\u2019ve said several times now that, like, what you do is, like, better than any hobby that you could possibly have, but like, I\u2019m going to ask anyway. \n\nLike, what do you do when you\u2019re not doing climate investing and senior technical fellowing at Meta?\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: My, my favorite three things, number one by far is anything my kids will do with me. So, I, you know, that spending time with the kids is number one.  I\u2019m a decent skier and a mediocre surfer. So, I love to go skiing. I love to go surfing. I\u2019ll never be great at them, but they\u2019re are a lot of fun. But those are my three things: family, and then a couple of, like, being in the outdoors doing silly things.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome. Well, it was amazing chatting with you. And as always, I\u2019m feeling more hopeful about our future, hearing your high degree of enthusiasm for all of this climate tech stuff that you\u2019re investing in. So, whatever I can ever do to help you out, like, I just want you to feel free to deputize me. And, like, I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing. So, thank you very much.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Keep pushing AI. We need it. Like, it\u2019s going to be a really helpful infrastructure platform for a lot of stuff here, Kevin. So, I think, and keep telling the stories of technologists and, like, I think we have this shot at producing a much better future for everyone, you know, and that is worth getting up every morning and putting the shoes on and going to work for.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I absolutely agree with you. All right, man, thank you.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Nice to see you.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: What a great conversation with Mike Schroepfer. So, as you were kind of mentioning while you were talking with him, and even at the top of the show, Kevin, like, what\u2019s so striking to me is that what Mike is doing now, he was taking on challenging problems at Meta, don\u2019t get me wrong, but what he\u2019s doing now is really challenging, but also really fascinating. And I\u2019m really glad that someone like him, with his experience, is able to kind of bring that lens towards the investment approach and kind of the mentorship approach to solve these very big and very important challenges.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, Mike and I have known each other for a really long time. And I have always been impressed, not just with Mike\u2019s technical expertise, which is tremendous, but the way that he tackles problems is so great. You know, he dives into things. He\u2019s got, you know, a learner\u2019s mindset. Like, he wants to learn as much as he possibly can. Like, he\u2019s just a really great first principles thinker.\n\nBut, like, he\u2019s led so many complicated things and done things with such big groups of people that he understands, you know, just the complexity of just how to get a large number of very bright people aligned on a mission, and, you know, how to go tackle really tough problems. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve got here. \n\nAnd, you know, if anything, I think the bag of problems that he\u2019s tackling are sort of the toughest in the world, because you have a problem that is very big and very imminent. It will not wait on any of us. It\u2019s coming whether we like it or not. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And you have, even worse than we have some cases in software where you\u2019re, like, trying to go fix something where you\u2019ve got decades\u2019 worth of prior investment and, like, you\u2019ve got to solve these problems of, you know, like, what can I reform versus what do I have to, like, just tear down to the ground and, like, rebuild from scratch in order to solve the problem the way it needs to be solved?\n\nSo, here, we\u2019ve got centuries in some cases of things that are, you know, sort of been institutionalized and lots of investment that we\u2019ve made in them that you have to understand how the new fits into that. And, you know, and then you have a complicated regulatory environment that sits on top of all of that. \n\nAnd so, you know, it\u2019s just great to have someone like Mike trying to push really hard to empower entrepreneurs to go, you know, help us find some solutions to these tough problems. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I couldn\u2019t agree more. And I feel like he is really uniquely positioned to kind of do that because of his experience. And I think it\u2019s notable, like his investment firm is called Gigascale, and that\u2019s certainly something that he\u2019s done in his career building platforms, as you two were discussing. And that\u2019s such an interesting thing to me, too. \n\nYou\u2019ve also worked a lot on building platforms, and you know what it\u2019s like to make things have to scale. And I feel like with these problems that Mike is investing in now, scale is really what\u2019s necessary. \n\nWhat\u2019s your experience? I guess kind of - you know, Mike alluded to this, talking about kind of needing to understand the amount of momentum you need for something. But what\u2019s your experience with, I guess, kind of figuring out when you need to take something from maybe being, all right, this is the size, but if we want this to actually be impactful and actually work, we need to go. You know, we can\u2019t just build one datacenter. We need to build, you know, 40 of them at the same time. \n\nCan you talk to me a little bit about that?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, for sure. I mean, and look, it\u2019s no accident that Mike and I are friends and that we\u2019ve always got along, because he and I share many of the same guiding principles for how you go tackle problems. \n\nYou know, I think the very best way that you can get change made at scale is to sort of use systems that are already in place to assist you. So, like, the thing that Mike talked about a bunch, which is, like, just letting the markets work, like, finding things that are \u2013 \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, leverage.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That are genuinely and authentically superior, and sustainable to the unsustainable things that are already in the marketplace, and, you know, the incumbents who are making them, I think it just does wonders every time we apply it anywhere. \n\nSo, it makes the incumbents better, and it presents an option to the incumbent that, you know, even if the incumbent\u2019s being especially intransigent, like, you know, everybody\u2019s just going to adopt the alternative. And so, like, that - using that market mechanism and that competition is, I think, a really effective thing. \n\nYou know, he mentioned another thing which is really interesting, which is, you know, this heat pump anecdote that he gave where, you know, there\u2019s a new heat pump technology that might be twice as expensive as the existing technology. And if you just knew that, you know, that 2x upfront cost meant that your long-term operating costs are going to be much less over the lifetime of the \u2013 \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: system, like, it\u2019s easy to choose the $10k upfront. And so, there, you know, the market making thing is just making sure that the consumer understands, you know, what the tradeoff is. And like, maybe you also need a policy thing upfront, which is, you know, how do you subsidize or, you know, allow the consumer to make that upfront investment. \n\nI mean, like, we, we just sort of take for granted a bunch of things about our financial markets right now. But, like, we don\u2019t give loans out to people just for grins. Like, you know, you loan people money because it lets them invest upfront in things that are long-term efficient. Like, if that weren\u2019t the case, like, you know the financial industry would be, you know, loan sharking and, like, none of it would make any sense.\n\nAnd so, letting the market efficiently allocate capital where it can and, like, where it\u2019s not, changing the rules of the marketplace so that that efficient allocation of long-term, efficient allocation of capital can happen is super, super important, I think.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I totally agree. And I also think what you were saying and what Mike was talking about, too, you know, making sure that people can understand, as you said, that tradeoff, understand how that market allocation is going to work and why it might be worth, you know, the initial outlay is great, too. But no, I think those are fantastic points. And I\u2019m really glad that Mike is taking his expertise from building platforms and applying them towards these other problems, too. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And look, in addition to the climate investing he\u2019s doing, like, I think part of our conversation was just sort of super interesting, because Mike, again, has had one of the legendary Silicon Valley careers. You know, like, not everybody gets to go from Boca Raton, Florida to, you know, being, you know, CTO, you know, for as many years as Mike was of, like, one of the iconic big platform companies in technology. \n\nAnd I think Mike shared a whole bunch of, like, super interesting stuff, from how he even approached his career that, like, even if you\u2019re not going to go be the CTO of a big tech company, is going to serve you incredibly well as you progress through life and try to figure out how to do valuable and rewarding things.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I totally agree. And his run - you know he was at Facebook for more than 15 years, but his run you know as CTO aligns with, you know, one of the greatest kind of growth stories of any tech company that we\u2019ve seen. \n\nAnd I think, as you said, even if you\u2019re not a CTO, just kind of looking at that approach and looking at kind of the decisions that he made, you know, when the tools \u2013 I think he mentioned, you know, PyTorch and React - that can touch so many people has been incredibly influential and I think is incredibly inspiring.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And, you know, and the techniques for how he manages career, like, run experiments with your career, like, what can you learn? \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, you know, how can I go line my activity up with, you know, I\u2019m going to go learn a thing that\u2019s going to help me make better decisions about my career in the future. You know, like, thinking about leverage, thinking about markets, like, you know, making sure that you\u2019re landing in places where your effort and activity is going to be - you know, for macroeconomic reasons, is going to be aligned with the potential for high impact.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And taking risks, too, right? Like, you know, deferring your masters to go, you know, do something for, you know, working at a startup and having that experience, sometimes taking those bets, which is also what he\u2019s doing now as an investor.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And, like, it\u2019s a Warren Buffett quote, but it\u2019s a good one. Like, the best investment anybody can make is in themselves. And so, just really, really thinking about, like, how am I getting better? Like, how do I improve? How am I learning more? Like, how am I putting myself in situations where, you know, my growth is, you know, increasing or has the option to increase? Like, I think those are all good questions for all of us to be asking ourselves, all the time.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I totally agree. Everybody keep learning. \n\nAll right, well that is all of our time that we\u2019ve got for today. Huge thanks to Mike Schroepfer for joining us.
