{"episode": "Ep-57 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Kevin Roose", "text": "KEVIN ROOSE: There\u2019s a moment right now, where a lot of the kind of conventional wisdom about what is possible and impossible to do with technology has gone by the wayside, and we\u2019re just kind of discovering this new world, and what a fascinating time to be covering, not just AI, but tech in general, as it touches so many other things.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn this podcast, we\u2019re going to get behind the tech. We\u2019ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what\u2019s happening today. Stick around.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n[MUSIC]\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello, and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub, Christina Warren.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And today, we have a really exciting guest joining us, another Kevin, Kevin Roose. He is a technology columnist and podcast host for the New York Times, where he covers all kinds of stuff about technology, including automation, AI, cybersecurity, digital wellness.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut where you may know him from most recently is that he was the journalist who wrote like one of the most talked about columns, honestly, in years, where he wrote about his surprising conversation with the Bing bot, aka Sydney.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s also a former colleague of mine. I\u2019m super excited that you\u2019re going to get to talk with him.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKevin, can you share a little bit more about like why you wanted to bring Kevin Roose on, you know, Sydney\u2019s paramour?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Kevin is one of the most thoughtful journalists working right now covering AI. And we\u2019re at a point in time where I think journalists covering AI is like, especially important. Like, we have this technology that is one way or the other going to have really substantial impacts on society. And I think it\u2019s super important for the public to be well informed about what is going on with the technology, where it\u2019s headed, and, you know, giving people some tools to think about how to, you know, frame their own opinions about AI.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat article that Kevin published about Sydney I think is actually the most read article in New York Times history. I\u2019ve heard that now from a couple of people at the New York Times, which is kind of incredible. And I think he did a really \u2013 a really great job publishing the full details of the transcript of the conversation that he had. And so, you know, like, I think that\u2019s actually really super solid reporting.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd plus, you know, I\u2019ve had a few interactions with him, like around that article. And before that, I had been on his podcast and like, I just I find him super thoughtful and interesting. So I was really excited that he agreed to be on my podcast.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I\u2019m super excited, too, and let\u2019s go ahead and give that conversation with Kevin a listen.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Kevin Roose is a technology columnist for the New York Times, where he covers the tech that influences our lives, culture and society. In addition to being a reporter, he\u2019s the bestselling author of three books, Future proof, Young Money, and the Unlikely Disciple. He\u2019s written about everything from automation and AI to the semester he spent undercover as a student at Liberty University. His most recent book, Future Proof, is a guide to surviving the technological future and includes nine rules to help people feel more confident about being happy in a machine filled world. In addition to his writing, Kevin cohosts the Times\u2019 weekly tech podcast, Hard Fork.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKevin, I am so glad to have you on the show today.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Thanks so much for having me. Two Kevins on one podcast. Is that even legal?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s, you know, sort of a weird thing, right?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo we always start these conversations by going all the way back to childhood. And, like, you obviously are doing a very important and interesting job now. And so, I\u2019d just sort of love to understand better, like how you got interested in either journalism or the technology world that you cover. Like, tell us a little bit about how you got started.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Yeah, so I grew up in a small town in Ohio, and I was obsessed with computers from a very early age. This was in the \u2013 the \u201890s. And I remember, you know, using my parents\u2019, you know, dial-up modem to get onto AOL so that I could look stuff up or talk to my friends or play chess online.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd my first job, I was actually about maybe 10 or 11, I started building websites with my brother for like, the local businesses in our town, and really just sort of embraced the internet kind of as a way to escape my small town.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd I know a lot of people have had that experience, where the internet sort of becomes this refuge or this place where things are a lot more fun and interesting. There\u2019s a lot more going on than maybe the place where you physically live.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo I was always on the internet. I was always in, you know, IRC chat rooms, and on AOL Instant Messenger and, you know, pirating software, including some Microsoft software, sorry about that, and just, you know, spent all the time that I could on the internet.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so, when I started getting into journalism as a college student, you know, tech was always something that really interested me. And I had this very bizarre kind of backward career trajectory, where I wrote a book while I was in college, which is the book you mentioned about going undercover at a very conservative Christian School in Lynchburg, Virginia called Liberty University.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat experience was sort of my introduction to journalism, and had nothing to do with tech, but then sort of gradually over the next few years after college, I sort of worked my way back to covering tech, which is what I\u2019ve been doing for like the last decade.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, there are a couple of things there that I\u2019d like to dig into, I mean, maybe the first of which is I, oftentimes in these conversations that I have with folks, and like I suspect I\u2019m about 10 years older than you are, but I had a similar experience with computers when I was young.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd I just sort of wonder, and I don\u2019t know whether you have a take on this, whether that sense of the world expanding through computers from, you know, you sort of being in this place where, you know, it\u2019s a very small community, and you get your hands on a computer for the first time and you connect to the internet, or you connect to like, there was no \u2013 like, there was no modern internet in the form that it\u2019s in now when I was a kid, but, you know, there was still dial up, and, you know, you could do IRC and whatnot. And so, like, that moment that you connect to this larger community is like, really thrilling and empowering.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd I wonder, I mean, you must have some of that today, but like, it\u2019s also a very different experience, because everybody just sort of inherits connection from scratch now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Yeah, well, now everyone\u2019s as online as we were back in the \u201890s. You know, there still are pockets of the internet that feel like that kind of old Internet of the \u201890s, but, you know, it\u2019s vastly different. You know, everyone\u2019s spending all their time on the internet now, so it\u2019s not as novel.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd \u2013 and there\u2019s something \u2013 you know, there was something really liberating about that. You know, I could, as a, you know, 11-year-old kid, be talking about things on message boards, or designing websites for businesses, who had no idea that I was 11 and in a small town in Ohio. I was just, you know, whatever my\u00a0 screen name, or my user handle was.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd there was something kind of, you know, now we talk about kind of\u00a0the anonymous parts of the internet, or the pseudonymous parts of the internet as being dark and dangerous, and there\u2019s sort of a risk associated with that; don\u2019t you want to know who you\u2019re talking to.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut as someone who\u2019s spent a lot of time on the other side of that, as like, you know, a kid who was, you know, not pretending to be someone else, but just who was sort of obscuring that part of his identity, and getting away with it, like that was kind of thrilling for me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: So I do miss that part of it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, there was also this interesting thing, too, that there was a high barrier to entry of getting on the internet. And so, you know, if you passed that barrier, like you were able to sort out all of the complexity to get on.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOnce you got there, there were just a whole bunch of people like you. And so, it honestly didn\u2019t matter that you were 11, you were clever enough to find your way into these forums, and that was the entry price, right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Yeah. And here was something cool about that. It felt like being let into a secret club or, you know, having a type of skill that meant that you could do things that your friends couldn\u2019t do at school.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut yeah, it was \u2013 I mean, it was just so much fun, and I just, I would have lived there all the time, if I could have. If I didn\u2019t have to, like, you know, put on pants and go to school, I probably would have just sat there on the internet all day.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And were your parents technical at all?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Not so much. My dad was a lawyer, my mom was a college administrator, but my dad was really the sort of most tech person in the family. You know, he was the guy who would like, you know, go out and buy the Kaypro, you know, when it was new, and he was just a hobbyist, but he was into tech.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so, you know, we always had sort of not the newest computer, like it was never like the fanciest or newest one, but, you know, we had broadband internet before a lot of people I knew. You know, we always sort of had a computer that was no more than a few years old. So I was lucky in that respect that I got to play around with that.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd then the best, you know, moment of my childhood, maybe not the best moment, but one of the formative moments was when I got to actually move the\u00a0 old family computer when we got a new one, the new one came into my room.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Nice.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: And so, that was like, okay, now my screen time has gone from like four or five hours a day to like, way more than that, because now I can stay up late at night. I don\u2019t have to go to sleep, and I can just be playing Space Invaders all night.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s awesome.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo let\u2019s talk about your tech chops. So what were your tools of choice when you were building these websites?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: I started doing it sounds like I\u2019m flexing or bragging. I started doing it by hand in a text editor in HTML. I then went to some, you know, tools. Like I remember using Dreamweaver for a while, these sort of like early WYSIWYG, you know, HTML, CSS editors. I did a little bit of Flash, a little bit of Java, but mostly, you know, HTML and CSS.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Nice. And what was your favorite text editor? This is a very important thing for programmers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Gosh, what did I even use? I mean, it might have just been like the default Windows one, because I probably thought that was very cool.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, dude, Notepad is legit. Like, we have a lot of people who really, really, really love \u2013\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Some great software has been built in Notepad.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, for sure. So I want to talk about like you had this experience with computers when you were young, and it sounds like you didn\u2019t get inspired to, like, invest your life in journalism until you were in college. Like, how did you get interested in that?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Well, I was interested in journalism. I mean, I loved to read as a kid. That was my other big hobby is I just read all the time. And I really loved these kind of like, magazine style, reported pieces that were, you know, creative and interesting, what they now call, like New Journalism, although even though it\u2019s like, you know, 70 years old at this point.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut it was, you know, I love Tom Wolfe and Gay Talese and Joan Didion, and these writers who just would go out and report, but also just had so much personality, and that really shone through.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so during my freshman year of college, I decided that I wanted to get a writing internship, just to see what I could learn and if that was something. So I applied to like 20 magazines in New York, hoping that one of them would take me on and all of them rejected me, and because I was 18, and what did I know about writing, and what skills did I have to offer?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd then I sort of took a flyer. I wrote a fan letter, essentially, to this writer named A.J. Jacobs, who I really admired. And he was sort of an experiential journalist. He would go do things, you know, he would read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica, and then write a book about it, or \u2013\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Right.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: he did a book where he followed all the rules in the Bible for a year, and then wrote a book about that.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so, I had read one of his books, really liked it, wrote him a letter said, could I come work for you for the summer? And he wrote back, much to my surprise, and said, sure. So he was sort of my first mentor, my first experience with a professional journalist, and through that internship, that\u2019s how I ended up getting my first book deal.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: The next thing that I wanted to chat with you about is, you know, I sort of feel like you\u2019re covering technology, but you\u2019re also living inside of an industry where technology has had rather enormous impacts on the business itself, and it continues to sort of have impacts. Like, even in the last handful of years, like I think there\u2019s less popular conversation about it now than there was a couple of years ago, but like, there was this big movement of people to Substack, and like, you know, folks who are, you know, not working for publishers, but like trying to, you know, build their own personal publishing brand.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd you\u2019ve been doing this long enough where I\u2019m curious what your observations are about how technology itself is impacting the news business, and like, what do you think that means for, you know, people like you who are, you know, graduating right now and hoping to have a career in journalism, and like, what their future and career is going to look like.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Yeah, it\u2019s interesting. I don\u2019t feel like I ever really experienced the news industry before this stuff started happening. I mean, you know, you\u2019ll hear old timers talking about, you know, when they were filing on typewriters, and, you know, fax machines and the like, and that was all before my time.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou know, when I got into journalism in the early aughts, it was already undergoing a transformation. You know, you had the, you know, the sort of rise of the kind of new media companies, the Buzzfeeds, the Huffington Posts, the Vices, the Voxes. You know, those were all sort of already underway, or just starting up. Gawker I mean, was a big thing when I was coming up in journalism.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd, you know, when I went to work at the New York Times for the first time, they were still very much grappling with what is happening to not only our business, but lots of other businesses as a result of technology.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI remember I was at the New York Times when Facebook bought Instagram, and it was like, on the front page of the newspaper. And that was sort of a big deal at the time. I mean, looking back, it seems obvious. Obviously, that turned out to be like one of the biggest, you know, business stories of that decade. But at the time, it was like, you\u2019re putting Instagram on the front page of the New York Times. Like, does it really merit that?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd I was sort of a beneficiary of all of the confusion and the sort of panic and the chaos in the media industry. Because I was young, I was techie, and I was like, I could sort of explain things to people who were maybe a little less native in it. And that was a really, like, successful niche for me, just like explaining what\u2019s going on the internet.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut now that\u2019s like everyone is writing about what\u2019s going on the internet. If you look at, you know, cable news, it\u2019s just people reading out social media posts, and talking about what happened on the internet. So the internet used to be kind of this advanced warning system for what was going to show up in the news, and now I just \u2013 I feel like it\u2019s, you know, the news is increasingly just covering things that have happened on the internet.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo it\u2019s been, you know, I\u2019ve tried to sort of stay on the edge. I mean, as a tech journalist, I\u2019m always excited about the bleeding edge, the frontier, what\u2019s coming. And so, you know, I\u2019ve always just tried to stay there and sort of ride that and be curious about it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, one of the things to me that seems pretty extraordinary about what\u2019s going on is there\u2019s so much more writing about the news media itself than there seems to have been in the past.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo like, when I was in grad school, you know, I would listen to On the Media on NPR, and you know, you had Jon Stewart on Comedy Central. Like, those were the two places where, you know, folks were talking about what the media itself was doing.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd like, there is so much now of, you know, people reflecting on the state of, you know, the media industry and what\u2019s going on and where it\u2019s headed, and what\u2019s good and what\u2019s bad. It almost feels overwhelming to me, and I\u2019m not even in it. So I don\u2019t know what it feels like to you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: It\u2019s been challenging. I mean, there are \u2013 you know, as \u2013 if you were a journalist working in the \u201890s, or even earlier than that, you really didn\u2019t hear from consumers of your work all that often, right? You might get someone might write an angry letter to the editor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Or, you know, a letter might show up in your mailbox. Or you might get a call on the phone from someone who, you know, got the switchboard operator to connect them to your desk and had you know, \u201cI want to talk to you about a sentence in your last article that I didn\u2019t like.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd now it\u2019s just it\u2019s constant. It\u2019s a constant feedback loop from social media,\u00a0 from, frankly, like a lot of the media covering itself, and especially at the New York Times, which has the blessing or misfortune of being sort of a newsbeat unto itself at many other media outlets.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo as a journalist, I mean, I think that accountability has sharpened my sword a little bit. Like it just, it really has forced me to, like, be diligent and you know, make sure that when I\u2019m putting something out, it is as correct as I can make it and as fair as I can make it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut it also has driven a lot of people crazy. Like, that level of feedback in your job is \u2013 you know, I remember talking to someone a few years ago, and this was, I had started covering, like extremists, and I was doing a lot of stories about QAnon and you know, people threatening me, and there was death threats, and it was a really tumultuous period in my professional life.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd I just remember, like, talking with a friend outside of media, and he said, you know, if I have a bad day at work, like I get an angry email from my boss, like if you have a bad day at work, you end up on Fox News. It\u2019s like, it really just sort of raises the overall risk of error, and lowers the sort of the margin for error\u00a0in almost any journalism related job, but especially these kind of legacy, high profile ones.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: I want to pause for a minute and talk a little bit more about that because there is this extraordinary thing here, where some of the most important things for you and your colleagues in your industry to write about are some of the most controversial things that come with the greatest volume of some of that, like potentially scary scrutiny that is headed your way.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd like everybody needs scrutiny, right? Like, I need scrutiny, like you need it, but like, there\u2019s a difference between, you know, like, hey, here\u2019s an honest take on, like what I see you doing, and another is like, I\u2019m going to kill you if you don\u2019t stop doing what you\u2019re doing.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd I just sort of wonder, like how, you know, either you or your colleagues, like muster up what it takes to just go do the thing that needs to be done, even in the face of all of this criticism that you may be getting.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Yeah, it\u2019s a good question, and I just want to start my answer by acknowledging that, like, I have it very easy relative to many of my colleagues and peers. Some of my colleagues literally go into war zones.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: And dodge bullets and get taken hostage. And that is a level of risk that I have never taken or never wanted to take in journalism, but I have a lot of respect and admiration, and just awe at the colleagues of mine who do that.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo we\u2019re talking about, you know, when we\u2019re talking about getting, you know, angry tweets from people, like that is already \u2013\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Right.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: \u2013 you know, a better state of affairs than many journalists around the world working.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI\u2019ll add the caveat that I\u2019m a white man, and as such, like I get a lot less of this, and it\u2019s a lot less pointed and scary than some of my colleagues who are not.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo those caveats aside, I will say like, this has been something that I\u2019ve been thinking about and dealing with for years now, since I really started throwing myself into the sort of bowels of internet culture as a reporter.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou know, it\u2019s tough. It\u2019s tough knowing that you\u2019re going to publish something, and just people are going to be unhappy with it. And, you know, there are good versions of that. I mean, if you\u2019re writing about Harvey Weinstein, or some, you know, predator somewhere, and, you know, you know they\u2019re going to be pissed off, but you also know, like, that\u2019s the right story to tell, and that\u2019s, you\u2019re confident, that can kind of keep you going.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut I think people have gotten wise to the fact that, you know, reporters are people and can be influenced and swayed and harassed and intimidated and bullied and made fearful just like anyone else.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so, you know, I really think like, that is part of the skillset of a journalist in 2023 is like, can you actually show up every day and do your job, knowing that people out there are going to be, some of them, extremely unhappy with it?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo, you know, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve finished that process yet. I still think a lot about, you know, people who don\u2019t like what I write, and probably too much about it. But I will say, like doing a podcast has been really healing in that respect, because I think the feedback for \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what your experience has been, but my experience has been that, you know, podcast listeners are so much more generous than readers. Because, you know, they hear your voice. They have more context for the thing that you\u2019re saying. They\u2019re not just seeing like a screenshot of something that you wrote that\u2019s being passed around on social media, and people are dunking on and going, what an idiot this guy is.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo that\u2019s been really kind of restorative for me is having this outlet where I feel like I can speak to an audience of people who are choosing to hear from me, and they understand me better than maybe the casual reader who\u2019s coming across something I wrote.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, for sure, I\u2019ve had a similar experience. And it\u2019s sort of interesting, like, I think there\u2019s a whole continuum of how people respond to things that I\u2019m putting out in the world, depending on the medium.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo the podcast is certainly different from a social media post. Like, a social media post is different from an essay. An essay is different from the book. Like I get, like different sorts of feedback from each of them.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd one of the things that I\u2019ve been trying to be a lot more careful about since 2016, where I got good and properly worked up on social media over like, all of the social things happening then, is, you know, I try to be very careful about what I consume, and I try not to \u2013 I try to put less pithy stuff out into the world, because the valuable thing to me is like, substantive conversation, like reading things that someone has thought really hard and carefully about and where, you know, they\u2019re sitting inside of an institutional process, whether it\u2019s writing peer reviewed, scholarly articles, or whether they\u2019re a journalist at, you know, a place like the New York Times, or the Economist, where there\u2019s like, a strong set of editorial guidelines and principles.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut like, that information to me is way better than just reading the same angry opinion over and over and over and over and over again on social media, where I\u2019m not learning anything new the 500th time I\u2019ve read the same thing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Yeah, there\u2019s definitely like a value in curating your information diet, just like you would curate your food diet. You know, a little spice now and then is nice. And so, I do, you know, I like social media, I confess, at least my feeds that I\u2019ve curated.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut yeah, I mean, I definitely think like one thing that I have tried really hard to do kind of in the last few years is just reverse the kind of atrophy of my attention span, and really build it back up by reading longer things and even books sometimes. I know, crazy. But yeah, it\u2019s a constant struggle.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. But even on social media, I\u2019ve found that what you put out there typically gets reciprocated. So my \u2013 the social media presence that I enjoy the most is I\u2019ve got an Instagram account, where all I do is post about crap that I make. And the feedback that I get from that is overwhelmingly positive because all I\u2019m doing is like, hey, like I made this thing, like, you know, and you don\u2019t have to react to it if you\u2019re not interested. And like, nobody\u2019s on there saying, \u201cHey, that sucks,\u201d or you know, it\u2019s just really positive.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: I\u2019m curious, like, I know you\u2019re asked \u2013 you\u2019re the one asking the questions on this podcast, but I\u2019m curious \u2013\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, no, ask away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: \u2013 like, because, you know, we in some ways are inhabiting different worlds, where like, I kind of have to have a social media presence, right? Like, in journalism, at least in 2023, like, you know, it\u2019s really hard to move up in the world of journalism, to be noticed, to \u2013 you know, to get the attention of editors who might hire you or commission something from you, or, you know, give you a book deal or something. Like, you really do have to have this sort of cultivated public persona.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhereas in tech, my sense is that for most people, like you can do pretty well, even if all you\u2019re using is LinkedIn, or, you know, it\u2019s not a sort of job requirement in the same way. So \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: A hundred percent.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: But I\u2019m curious, because a lot of tech people still want to post, like they still feel like there\u2019s social value in having, you know, a Twitter account or, you know, an Instagram account and sort of being an influencer. So I\u2019m curious where you think that comes from.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Look, I think if you\u2019re a venture capitalist, it probably makes a lot of sense because, like, deal flow matters a lot. I think if you are a startup, and you\u2019re recruiting heavily, and like trying to convince people to come work for you, when, you know, they have so many choices it\u2019s probably important. Like, I think there are probably a bunch of reasons why it might be important.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was more important to me many years ago than it is now. And it\u2019s just \u2013 and it\u2019s still important. Like, I post regularly on both, you know, Twitter \u2013 I refuse to call it the new name \u2013 and on LinkedIn. I mean, like, I\u2019m sort of biased.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: But you don\u2019t have to. Like, you know, it\u2019s always just curious to me when people, who don\u2019t have to post still post, because for a lot of journalists I know, it\u2019s like, if I didn\u2019t have to do this for my job, there\u2019s no way I would subject myself to this.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And I really, I like, believe and appreciate and am sympathetic to that.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo I mean, when I post on LinkedIn, like, again, it is because of the social contract on the network. The feedback that I get from posting there tends to be almost overwhelmingly positive. So it\u2019s not like I\u2019m starting little controversies, you know, by the innocuous things that I say on LinkedIn.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd the reason that I say them is like, I\u2019ve got, I don\u2019t know, like 800,000 followers on LinkedIn, something like that.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Look at you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And \u2013 yeah, yeah, but, you know, like look, I \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: You\u2019re a Linked Influencer, as they say,\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: There\u2019s definitely a professional back and forth on LinkedIn that still makes some kind of sense to me. But, you know, for my personal, like the thing, like I actually do get joy in posting things on Instagram, and then, you know, sort of seeing what I get back. And I just wonder, in general, like how much joy people get from their use of social media.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: I mean, there\u2019s definitely a reason people keep coming back. But you know, you could say the same about casinos. It\u2019s like, are you having fun, or can you just not quit?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: So, you know, I\u2019ve tried to be really careful about, you know, segmenting off parts of my social media life that are just for fun, or you know, I \u2013 like I use TikTok, but I\u2019m not posting except for my podcast. And so there are sort of apps that are fun apps and apps that are work apps, and I try to keep those pretty well, you know, cordoned off from each other.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So like you are writing a lot about AI. And you want to talk about a bewildering world, that is one of them. It\u2019s how you and I got connected. You know, we were chatting about some of the AI things that Microsoft and OpenAI were doing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut, you know, you\u2019ve just recently published a very good podcast with Dario from Anthropic, which, you know, was the result of you spending a whole bunch of time there. You know, you\u2019re sort of thinking about AI and people doing AI. And, you know, and it\u2019s a free-for-all right now.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo like, I\u2019d love \u2013\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: I think it\u2019s the most interesting thing happening in the world right now. But I\u2019m biased.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: As do I, like, although I\u2019m biased. So I\u2019d love to hear you explain why you think it\u2019s the most interesting thing in the world right now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Yeah, I mean, I\u2019ve been writing and thinking about AI for a long time. And I \u2013 you know, you and I both wrote books on it. You know, mine came out a few years ago. So this is something that I\u2019ve been obsessed with since I was a kid reading science fiction.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut it got real. You know, it \u2013 I was talking with someone a little while ago, and I was like, talking about how, you know, I\u2019m a tech columnist, I have to be writing about lots of tech stuff, I can\u2019t just be talking about what\u2019s going on in AI. And, you know, but I was sort of obsessed, and I was trying to tell this person, you know, why I was so obsessed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd they went, you know, I get it. They taught rocks to think. It\u2019s like, you know, that\u2019s pretty good. That\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: They taught rocks to think.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: And like, that encapsulates what is so fascinating about this moment in AI is we have these thinking rocks now. And like, what the hell are we going to do with them, and what are they going to do with us? And like, it just \u2013 it feels like a moment where all of the rules have gone out the window. No one really knows what\u2019s going on. Like, maybe you do. But if so please, enlighten me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut it just feels like there\u2019s a moment right now, where a lot of the kind of conventional wisdom about what is possible and impossible to do with technology has gone by the wayside, and we\u2019re just kind of discovering this new world, and what a fascinating time to be covering, not just AI, but tech in general, as it touches so many other things.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, one of the reasons why I was excited to have you on the podcast is I think that what you\u2019re doing and what your colleagues are doing right now in journalism is a pretty important thing in this moment, when so many things are in flux.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd I really do believe that the technologies of AI are A) going to do nothing but get more capable over time, and B) have really profound impacts on society. And, you know, it\u2019s sort of a very important thing, I think, for society right now to like, have real high quality information about what\u2019s going on, and not just what I\u2019m telling folks, right? Like, it requires \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou know, and like, look, I try very hard to, you know, like I mean, we\u2019ve sort of talked on your podcast about what my motivation and mission is in doing all of this stuff, which is, you know, to try to build tools that are empowering people, like the ones in my small community that I grew up in.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut you know, I\u2019m also like, only one point of view on all of this, and like, we need lots of people to come to their own opinions about what\u2019s going on and how things are being used and where they want it steered.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo I don\u2019t \u2013 you know, I\u2019m guessing part of what you\u2019re doing is genuine curiosity and fascination with what\u2019s going on. But the other part is like, you know, it does seem like there\u2019s a mission here that\u2019s important.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Absolutely. I mean, I\u2019d be lying if I said I was just reporting on this stuff out of pure enthusiasm and curiosity. Like, I do also think that the media performs a valuable role in holding institutions and individuals accountable.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe are building some of the most \u2013 we, I say we. I mean you essentially and your peers in the tech industry are building some of the most powerful technology ever created. And I think without the media, there just wouldn\u2019t be a kind of countervailing sort of, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s, you know, a force on the minds of the people building that technology or just a caution around the technology, but I\u2019ll give you an example of what I mean.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo, you know, you and I had this now infamous encounter back in February \u2013\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: where you guys had just released Bing with this, you know, what we now know as GPT-4 running inside of it, and I had this insane conversation with Bing Chat, aka Sydney. Please don\u2019t hurt me, Sydney.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd, you know, it went on the front page, went totally viral, blew up, I\u2019m sure, you know, your inbox, my inbox, everyone\u2019s inbox for months.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Everybody. Everybody\u2019s inbox.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: And subsequent to that, like I started hearing from, you know, just in a nutshell, if people aren\u2019t familiar, it was a conversation that sort of lasted two hours in which Bing/Sydney, you know, confessed all these sort of dark secrets and tried to break up my marriage, and it was insane.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd \u2013 and subsequent to that story running, I got notes from a lot of other people at tech companies saying, you know, how do we prevent our technology from doing that. Or even \u2013 I got a leaked document from another big tech company, which had a sort of roadmap for their AI product, and listed on the roadmap was like, \u201cDo not break up Kevin Roose\u2019s marriage.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so, I really think that like that \u2013 and not to toot my own horn, this could have been anyone, but it did really like serve as a cautionary tale for other companies that are building similar technology.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so, I think that is what the media can and should do in moments of societal transformation and change is really hold a \u2013 you know, hold up a sign that basically tells people like, you know, you want to do this right or, you know, there will be \u2013 you know, there may be consequences for that.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and I think that is one of the very good things that came out of that experience. And, you know, it also, I think, is a \u2013 it\u2019s another important reason why it is I think you actually want to launch these things, you know, even if it results in something that floods your inbox, you know, for a while, is like you just sort of get the societal level conversation about, you know, what\u2019s possible, what\u2019s going on, like, where\u2019s the line, like, what\u2019s good, what\u2019s bad.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI mean, we haven\u2019t chatted since that story published, and one thing that I will say is, like, I deeply appreciate the part of the writing that you did, where you publish the full transcript of the conversation. So like that level of transparency, like it just wasn\u2019t confusing to anyone about, you know, like, what inputs into the system led to like, the things that it gave back, and like, that was super good.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI don\u2019t think many of the people who were coming into my inbox had read the full transcript, but I think that you\u2019re just 100% spot on. Like, the existence of this thing has, like, helped a lot of people, like just make sure that they\u2019re paying real attention to some very important things.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And also you know, some of this stuff is fuzzy, right, like, you know, where the line is, and like, part of what you all are helping doing is making sure that the public is paying enough attention to it, so they can weigh in and have an opinion about where the line should be.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Absolutely, I mean, it is an area where I think more public opinion is good. And right now, the number of people who are actually building this technology is like quite small, relative to the number of people who are using it, or who will soon be using it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so, I just think like, the more people know about what\u2019s going on, the better, and I think it\u2019ll ultimately be good for the tech industry to have that kind of feedback, even if it is annoying and blows up your inbox in the moment.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and for what it\u2019s worth, it was like I was never annoyed about that. I was sometimes \u2013\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: You were remarkably chill. I was pleasantly surprised by like, the response that, you know, you and I talked after I had had this conversation, but before I sort of published my story, and, you know, you didn\u2019t freak out, you didn\u2019t accuse me of lying. You know, it was a remarkably civil conversation.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd I have appreciated that because that\u2019s not \u2013 and I\u2019m not just blowing smoke here, like that is not the reaction that I expected, you know, given how these things can go with other tech leaders.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo you know, I think, you know, I\u2019m hopeful that the response to that article has not \u2013 the lesson from that has not been that we should build in secret and should never let anyone try our stuff.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: I hope that it has like been sort of salutary for the whole project of building good and safe and responsible AI to like, have some feedback along the way.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: One hundred percent. Like, I don\u2019t think anybody was \u2013 like, I\u2019m genuinely trying to think if anyone was irritated. Like everybody is sort of like, okay, this is good, lesson learned, and like, you know, we have a whole bunch of mechanism for, you know, preventing things like that from happening again. And, I mean, just \u2013\u00a0it\u2019s all good.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSomebody said to me at some point that, like all feedback is a gift. Like, the fact that you spent two hours trying very hard to get this thing to do unusual things, and then publish the whole transcript, and then wrote this article that helps people pay more attention to the importance of responsible AI, like all of that\u2019s a gift, like and that\u2019s the way you should just sort of look at it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Yeah, I\u2019ll remind, you know, tech executives of that the next time I get an angry call from a comms department. You know, Kevin Scott thinks feedback is a gift. So maybe you guys should get on board with that.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI did also hear that you guys had Sydney swag made, and I\u2019m a little offended that none of that has shown up in my house.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Did you hear about the beer? So this was my\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: I did.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: my favorite thing that came out of that article was that there was a brewery in Minneapolis that \u2013 that came out with a beer called, Sydney Loves Kevin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: And I have not tried it yet. I heard it was good. But, you know, maybe you and I can get a pint of it sometime.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: We should absolutely make a road trip to Minnesota to get a pint. That would be hilarious.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYeah, I \u2013 somebody sent me that article, or like a post mentioning that I think the week after, and it was like the most \u2013 like I laughed so hard, I almost fell out of my chair. (Laughter)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe last thing that I ask everyone on this podcast is like, I know you\u2019re probably busier now than you have ever been in your life, given the thing you\u2019re covering and how much is going on in AI right now. But I\u2019m curious to know what you do outside of work for fun.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: I have a one and a half year old.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Ah. So you do nothing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: So he keeps me pretty busy. So I change diapers, I install car seats. I \u2013 you know I clean the toys that he throws around on the floor. It is a full time job. So that is my main extracurricular hobby right now is hanging out with my son.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: So my kids are 13 and 15 now, and like the thing that I can tell you is it gets an awful lot better soon.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: It\u2019s hard to imagine. I\u2019m having a great time. And people say it keeps getting better.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s exhausting, though, right?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: I haven\u2019t experienced it. I mean, it\u2019s definitely like labor intensive and time intensive. But it\u2019s actually like it\u2019s the opposite, it\u2019s rejuvenating for me. It\u2019s like all I want to do at the end of a long workday is hang out with my kid. So I don\u2019t know if that makes me weird, but that\u2019s how I feel.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: No, that is another inspiring thing. So I think we will end it there, and I will let you get to your one and a half year old. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Thanks, Kevin.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Thank you so much for being on today. This was a great conversation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN ROOSE: Great to talk to you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n[MUSIC]\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right, that was such a great conversation with Kevin Roose. So I wanted to talk to you a little bit more about, towards the end of the conversation, we were talking a little bit about the article that Kevin wrote around Sydney, which as you mentioned, at the top of the show, one of the most read articles in New York Times history, according to the people that you\u2019ve talked to. I believe it. I saw it everywhere. I was actually \u2013 I think I was in Disney World when that article went up, and I was just mesmerized, and I was like, okay, this is incredible. I mean, it literally took me out of my vacation to read. So good job there, Kevin Roose.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut, you know, there was, I think, a lot of concern from some people in the technology community, when that article went out, that this might have like a dampening effect on this generative AI boom that we\u2019ve been seeing. That obviously didn\u2019t happen.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut I wanted to get your perspective. Why were you so open to having a conversation about what this was, being transparent about this is, you know, what happens when the token limit is exceeded and what can happen? Why was that important for you to have that conversation publicly and so soon as it happened, when, I\u2019m going to be honest with you, being a former journalist and working with a lot of PR people, that\u2019s usually not the common PR response to something like this?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter) Well, so there was an interesting technical thing that was going on, that I think was important for people to understand. You know, so the way that these systems work is they basically are just very complicated engines for predicting the next word. And so, when they get to a point where the thing that is being predicted next has a whole bunch of equiprobable outcomes, it just picks one. And if all of those probabilities are very low, so like any sort of next thing that\u2019s coming is like relatively unlikely, like that is how you get these quote/unquote \u201challucinations\u201d that people are talking about.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, if you have a very long and very unusual conversation with one of these systems, like, it\u2019s not that hard at all to get it to hallucinate, and, you know, say, you know, pretty outrageous things.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so \u2013\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: it was learning for us and like, you know, learning that was not a bad thing to have in public that, okay, we never intended for people to have super long, like, super unusual conversations with Bing Chat.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd now we know that they are, like, we\u2019re going to go engineer the system where it won\u2019t produce some of these outrageous things. So that\u2019s one thing.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd then the second thing is, I do think that, you know, as provocative as that conversation was, it had a whole bunch of stuff in it, where, you know, if the nature of the conversation was like, hey, you know, Bing Chat, I would like you to write me a science fiction story, or like a piece of fiction, like, if it was hallucinating inside of that context, it would be completely acceptable. But if someone were sitting in this chat agent, like having a sincere conversation with the system, where they thought all of this was real, you know, then like, it\u2019s something different.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so, like, it was a really useful conversation to be having, and like, I think, a framework for lots of conversations that we\u2019re going to have like this in the future, where we\u2019re going to have to collectively decide together like what is okay and what is not okay in these systems, because it\u2019s kind of difficult for us to figure out what users\u2019 expectations are of a brand new technology, if they\u2019ve never interacted with it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so, that\u2019s sort of the choices that we\u2019re making right now. It\u2019s like, we\u2019re going to let you interact with it, and there\u2019s some things that we\u2019re doing where like, they\u2019re just bright lines, and like, we\u2019re not going to let you use it to do things that we like \u2013 and everybody else can clearly understand are, like, very serious \u2013\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Sure.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 like, obvious harms.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And then there are going to be a whole bunch of gray zone things where the only way that we\u2019re going to figure out what people want is to like, let them use the product. And sometimes that means \u2013\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Totally.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 like, it\u2019s going to do something they don\u2019t want, and they\u2019re going to have to tell us about it. And I think that\u2019s okay.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I totally agree, and I think everything you said is spot on. And I do want to actually applaud you just for having that, I think, foresight to say that, yes, these are conversations we need to have, and we should probably have them earlier rather than later.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou know, I continue to be floored by just how quickly everything has moved in the last, you know, nine, ten months, and the fact that you know, the article came out, what, February, and here we are in August as we\u2019re recording this, and, you know, it feels like a lifetime ago just in terms of how much the tech has changed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: So I applaud you, I think, for responding the way that you did, and also Kevin for, you know, including the entire transcript, as he did. As you pointed out, that was great journalism, because I think that helped shape the conversation that we\u2019ve continued to have over the last year as the technology has only, you know, increased adoption and evolved as more people are doing more things.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think there\u2019s this other thing, too, where we sometimes lose this bit of nuance or perspective today, but it\u2019s entirely possible for like, two\u00a0 people or two organizations or two institutions operating in good faith to like, have hard conversations with one another \u2013\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Totally.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 and it not the end of the world.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And the objective ought not to be, let us never have these hard conversations. Like, that\u2019s kind of nutty.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so, in a sense, like, if I zoom all the way back out, I think that as long as everybody\u2019s operating in good faith, like let us have the hard conversations, and like even encourage them, please.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I think you\u2019re exactly right, have those hard conversations, listen to Kevin Roose\u2019s podcast Hard Fork, I\u2019m going to give him that plug there. And on that note, thank you so much for joining us. That\u2019s going to be all the time we have for today. Huge thanks again to Kevin Roose with the New York Times for joining us.
