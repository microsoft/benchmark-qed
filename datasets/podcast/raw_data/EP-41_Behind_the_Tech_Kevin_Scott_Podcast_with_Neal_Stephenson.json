I hear other writers talking about self-discipline and writers block and the struggle. It\u2019s not like that for me. I mean, I don\u2019t mean to be egotistical or anything like that, but at no point in my career have I ever felt as though I were inflicting some kind of discipline on myself. It\u2019s just what I like to do.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we\u2019re going to get behind the tech. We\u2019ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what\u2019s happening today. Stick around.\n\n[music]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Christina Warren, Senior Cloud Advocate at Microsoft.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And our guest on the show today is Neal Stephenson. Neal is an American writer who is known for his works of speculative fiction, and in is seminal book, Snow Crash, Stephenson actually coined the term metaverse and popularized the term avatar in a computing context. He is one of my favorite authors in this genre. I\u2019m a massive fan. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, me too. I have been so profoundly influenced by Neal\u2019s works. I\u2019ve  read all of his books, over and over and over again, and the interesting thing to me about Neal is, I think he was especially prescient with Diamond Age and Snow Crash and Cryptonomicon, you know, which were books that he wrote 20 years ago-ish, but like his recent books are also just spot on, like he has a real knack for thinking deeply about the trends that are shaping the world and then extrapolating just a little bit forward to capture what is about to happen and it\u2019s \u2013 I just don\u2019t know how he does it.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No. I totally agree. I mean that is what I think is really special about his work, is that it feels both prescient and futuristic. It seems like, you know, it\u2019s not that far off, but it\u2019s just different enough that it seems \u2013 you know, it is fantasy, but as time goes on, like you just see, like how on the pulse all of his insights really have been.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, really incredible.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right, well, let\u2019s dive into your conversation with Neal.\n\n[music]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Our guest today is Neal Stephenson. Neal is an American novelist whose books have been categorized as science fiction, historical fiction, cyber punk, post-cyber punk and even baroque. He explores areas such as mathematics, cryptography, philosophy, currency and the history of science. \n\nNeal also writes nonfiction about technology for publications such as Wired and has worked as an advisor for Blue Origin. He was also chief futurist of Magic Leap for a few years. Neal\u2019s works include the novels Snow Crash, Cryptonomicon, The Diamond Age and Zodiac. Welcome to the show, Neal. \n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: It\u2019s a pleasure to be here. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, before we get into the stuff that you\u2019re working on today, I\u2019d really love to start with your interests as a kid and how you got into doing what it is that you do.\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Sure, well, it\u2019s a funny thing about people that, you know, whatever you experience, day to day, while you\u2019re growing up, you think it\u2019s normal until you get out into the wide world and see that it\u2019s not. So, I grew up in a college town in the Midwest: Ames, Iowa, that is home of a science and engineering-centric university. My parents are both engineers, scientist types and just where I grew up, that was true of the parents of almost all of the other kids around me.\n\nSo, that was kind of the air that I was breathing when I was a kid and it led to typical boyhood interests, you know, of wanting to be an astronaut, flying model rockets, model airplanes, tinkering with things, and so on and so forth. So that was my life until I graduated from high school and went to university at the age of 17. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And were your parents technical people?\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah. My paternal grandfather was a physicist; maternal grandfather, a biochemist. My dad, an electrical engineering professor. My mother was a chemist who worked as a research assistant in labs, life sciences labs at the university, and various uncles and aunts and so on also had, you know, more or less technical professions.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, super-interesting that you must have had science, mathematics and engineering and technology, just in the air that you were breathing, but did your parents have any opinion about what direction your life should take, were they pushing you in particular directions, or just sort of encouraging curiosity?\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: I think more just encouraging curiosity. I don\u2019t think there was pushing in the sense we\u2019d normally think of pushy parents. It\u2019s more kind of just what is considered normal in a household. You know, when people all around you, in your neighborhood in your social circle, have got advanced degrees or they\u2019re working on PhD dissertations, or what have you, that is just kind of ends up seeming to be a typical career path in the same way that if you grew up in a family of carpenters, it would seem completely normal to learn carpentry and get a job as a carpenter. But I didn\u2019t ever feel any pressure in the sense that one normally thinks of that. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, so I think that\u2019s a good segue into beginning to talk about your work as an author. You probably get this a lot, especially from computer nerds that you talk with, but your works were extraordinarily influential for me. So, I read them when I was, you know, at this developing point in my career, and you know, the thing I think your books did for me was maybe what your environment did for you, so they provided this world where, you know, you had this vision and it wasn\u2019t all bleak, nor was it all, you know, optimistic and Pollyanna, but it seemed like real world, with real characters, with real struggles and \u2013 you know, real consequences for the things that they were choosing to do, like in this environment that they were constrained by in a variety of creative ways, and it has shaped a lot about how I think about what the future could be. Was that your intention when you set out to write these works?\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Well, when I set out it was a fairly chaotic and unplanned kind of just sort of lunging randomly into the unknown, so I \u2013 the first book that I wrote  came out of nowhere. I was still in college. I was living in a slum apartment in Boston. I had no money. Spring break rolled around. I couldn\u2019t go anywhere, and so I just sat alone on the couch for 10 days and typed and ended up producing a short fantasy novel. It\u2019s never been published, never will be, but that kind of made me aware of something I hadn\u2019t known before which is that I\u2019m capable of sitting down and writing a book. \n\nAnd then when I graduated from college, I was stuck at home for a while and wrote a second book, and then decided, well, maybe I should actually try to make a go of this. You know, I can \u2013 it\u2019s not unusual for someone to take a year or two off between undergraduate college and graduate school, so maybe I\u2019ll just try this for a while, and if it doesn\u2019t work out, grad school would be my default option. \n\nSo, I did that and happened to get lucky with the third book, very lucky, got connected to an editor and agent in New York who were willing to devote a little bit of time to helping me develop as a writer, and so that was my first published book, The Big U, but it came about in a pretty chaotic way. \n\nYou know, I had written some excerpts of it and kind of an outline of what I wanted to do, and sent that off as a query and when a positive response finally came back, I realized I needed to write the whole thing, so I burned all of my vacation time at work and just sat there, again, for a couple of weeks, just banging this thing out, and what I delivered was a mess, but again, I had an editor, Gary Fisketjon, who was willing to spend some time going over it and showing me how to clean it up.\n\nSo all of this \u2013 I mean, the picture I\u2019m trying to paint here is that, in general, this was just total unplanned chaos and hasty improvisation and not any kind of systematic career development.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, I am sort of curious, like what gave you the courage or confidence, or whatever it was, to sit down and write those first two things I mean, did you even have an expectation that anyone was going to read them, or was it a thing that you were doing for yourself? Had you written things before?\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: I don\u2019t think a lot of courage was really involved. I mean, it was really just me with nothing else to do, doing this because it was amusing and kind of interesting. I enjoyed doing it. And obviously, at that point in your life, you\u2019re thinking about, wow, could I make a career of this, is anyone ever going to read it, might somebody buy it \u2013 so that\u2019s totally on your mind, but you know, at that stage, it feels more like a hobby project or sort of self-expression. You know, there\u2019s no risk that\u2019s really being taken, and so I just did it. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s, having written a book, obviously one that\u2019s \u2013 neither as good as, nor as popular as any of the things that you\u2019ve done, like it\u2019s just a lot of work. I mean, it\u2019s a real exercise in self-discipline when you have this world of possibilities. You can choose to do anything with your time to sit down, you know, with yourself and a keyboard and try to get your thoughts organized enough to tell a story, or you know, describe a set of ideas well enough that somebody else might find some value in them. I\u2019m always fascinated to talk to folks like you who have made writing their profession and try to understand how it is you get from one project to the next.\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah, I don\u2019t know, I think I\u2019m a little bit of a freak, even among writers. I hear other writers talking about self-discipline and writer\u2019s block and you know, the struggle. It\u2019s not like that for me. I mean, I don\u2019t mean to be egotistical or anything like that, but it\u2019s never \u2013 at no point in my career have I ever felt as though I were inflicting some kind of discipline on myself. It\u2019s just what I like to do.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s fantastic. So, I think one of the really extraordinary things about your books is you\u2019ve been very prescient, and I think part of it is because the books have literally influenced people who are building tech and doing science, but you also have been a fairly accurate prognosticator of some trends that have unfolded pretty closely to how you\u2019ve described them. I mean, and it\u2019s sort of consistent. I mean, like obviously, we\u2019ve got, you know, companies out now spending tens of billions of dollars building metaverse which is a term you coined years ago.\n\nBut also in your last book, Fall, I was just struck, the first third of that book. You know, not to spoil anything for anyone, but the way that you describe this near future with the internet and misinformation and \u2013 you know, this plausible scenario that you could use to sort of attack the infrastructure of the internet. Like I read it and I was like, wow, this is all chillingly possible. \n\nSo, how I mean, it\u2019s probably a stupid question, but how do you get into the headspace or expose yourself to enough information where you can sort of think these thoughts and get as consistently close to the puck as you do?\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Well, thank you. I started writing computer programs when I was 14 years old. You know, we had a little room in our high school with a modem connection to the mainframe at the university and a teletype, and we would write programs in BASIC on paper tape and run them over the phone. I continued writing programs in college, and after college, as soon as I could afford a computer, I got one, a Mac, the 1984 Toaster Mac, and learned how to write code on that. \n\nSo I wasn\u2019t doing it at quite a professional level, but enough to sort of get it and to understand how programming works, and if writing hadn\u2019t worked out for me, probably the most likely career path would have been that I would have ended up writing code somewhere in a tech company. And at the time that I wrote Snow Crash, I had been trying to sort of combine some of my interests by \u2013 I was collaborating on a project to create a graphic novel where we were going to use some image processing to generate some of the imagery, and so I was writing code on a color Mac, I think it was the Macintosh 2 to do that. \n\nSo, that brought me kind of a little bit up to speed with the technology and the terminology of three-dimensional computer graphics and how all that stuff worked. So, that project didn\u2019t move forward but I was able to take some of what I\u2019d written for it, some of the characters and the ideas, and fold them into an original novel, Snow Crash, and so that book is kind of steeped in the technical knowledge that I had at the time, as a result of working on all that graphics stuff.\n\nAnd then from there on, I guess, with some of the other books it becomes just a matter of trying to follow current developments in different technologies, like in The Diamond Age, you know, it\u2019s largely about molecular nanotechnology, which is not something I ever did, obviously, but it was easy enough to read the available literature about how it might work and get some ideas regarding that, and so on and so forth, with Cryptonomicon and some of the other books.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I do think you do have a very high hit rate. Is part of that who you talk to? I mean, I\u2019m guessing, as your novels became more successful, like it\u2019s a little bit easier maybe to talk to experts, but like maybe you were I mean I guess because of your upbringing, you also had access to experts, just \u2013 you know, through academia. How important is that?\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah, it\u2019s more accessing literature, be it online or on paper, than talking to experts. There\u2019s a lag that happens where, when you\u2019re writing the book, people don\u2019t know who you are, necessarily, and then after the book comes out, they want to talk to you. So for example, in the case of the Baroque Cycle, I was doing all of the research for London and the early Royal Society from available literature and not really having a lot of direct contacts into that world, and then after the book came out, I began to hear from people in London who have connections to that city and to its history, who\u2014had I known them before when I was writing the book\u2014would have been incredibly valuable resources for me, but by the time they knew of me and I knew of them, it was kind of too late. \n\nIt\u2019s still a great pleasure and honor to know them and talk to them, but it\u2019s not going to affect what\u2019s in the book at that point. So that happens very consistently with all of my books. It\u2019s just kind of an inevitable thing, and there have been some cases where it was possible for me to kind of get ahead of that curve a little bit. So, in the case of Seveneves, for example, by virtue of having previously worked at Blue Origin, I knew enough people in the space industry that I was able to reach out to companies like Planetary Resources and Tethers Unlimited here in Seattle and get some direct input early enough in the process that it actually helped shape what appeared in the book, but that\u2019s the exception rather than the rule.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Super interesting. So, let\u2019s talk about today, like how \u2013 you know it seems to me, at least, that life is imitating art in a certain sense, that many of the things that you talked about in some of your earlier books, and even in your most recent books are unfolding pretty closely to the way that you described them in the books. \n\nSo, maybe let\u2019s talk a little bit about metaverse which is, you know, obviously a thing that is going to see a lot of change over the next handful of years, just because there\u2019s so many people inspired enough to invest a lot of their time and energy and capital in this space. Like what\u2019s your, you know, sort of rough take on where things are headed?\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Well, you know, metaverse, avatar and terms like that have been bouncing around the technical world for a long time now, but more as a kind of in-crowd kind of terminology and what\u2019s happened in the last year or so is that, that\u2019s kind of broken out into public discourse as a marketing term, as a sort of catch-all term to mean a lot of things, and so the \u2013 you know, I think kind of the most general thing I can say about it is just that we\u2019re bumping up against the limits of what can really be done with flat displays. \n\nSo, when I look at the \u2013 I mean, just the displays that are around me here in my workspace, they\u2019re spectacular, you know, they\u2019re gigantic screens that are showing images in incredibly high resolution. They show movies at, you know, full resolution, full sound quality. I\u2019ve got a TV, which is middle-of-the road, I mean, it\u2019s not a super-special TV, but you know, it\u2019s capable of showing movies that are as finely resolved as my eyes can detect. Like if we added more pixels to my TV set, it would be interesting technically, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to see the difference. \n\nSo, beyond a certain point, that kind of technology can\u2019t really get any better, and I think that people who are in the business of selling hardware and the associated software and operating systems to the general public need a place to go. They need a \"next thing,\" you know, that they can use to drive their businesses forward, and so metaverse is kind of a catch-all term now for stuff that people want you to buy a few years from now, and you know, by process of elimination, it\u2019s got to be something beyond screens. It\u2019s got to be, you know, stereoscopic or better displays, AR, VR, and then with that hardware, there has to be huge jumps forward in the capabilities of the software and the operating systems that drive pixels and sound into that hardware.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, the curious thing for me is like, and so I totally agree with you that metaverse is like an interestingly vague marketing term, and like the vagueness lets people project all sorts of expectation and belief into a thing and like I don\u2019t know that I really understand whether, like a particular thing is a metaverse and something else isn\u2019t. Like, for instance, like the way that I\u2019ve been thinking about metaverses in general, largely influenced by your work, is they seem to me, generally speaking to be \u2013 or need to be sufficiently convincing, immersive experiences that in some way sort of blur the classical boundary between digital and physical worlds.\n\nAnd \u2013 you know, like there are a lot of things that \u2013 maybe my definition is wrong, but there are a lot of things that satisfy the definition, and so I look at my kids who, really love Minecraft and Roblox, and these, you know, sort of 3D worlds that get projected onto a 2D screen. They almost exclusively play them on a tablet, which is a small 2D screen, but they are completely and utterly immersed, like they are convinced that what\u2019s happening in this world is real. Like there\u2019s interaction, like they build things, they \u2013 there\u2019s some form of commerce that happens in them. So, I mean, do you think it\u2019s even useful to try to define what a metaverse is now, or like we just sort of have to iteratively discover what the world wants them to be?\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Well, I mean, that\u2019s up to the individual, you know, what it is that they\u2019re looking for, like I \u2013 you know,  I\u2019m not a fan of tablets, personally, but some people obviously are, so if that works for you, great, otherwise maybe you\u2019re looking for some other hardware platform to work on, but I would say that, kind of a common thread is the idea of multiplayer, that you\u2019re interacting in real time with other people, who are in the same virtual space, even though they\u2019re physically not where you are.\n\nAnd I think another element that implicitly or explicitly is included in how people think about the metaverse is that it\u2019s not all one app, it\u2019s not all one game that \u2013 like, if you play Halo or World of Warcraft, you\u2019re in a three-dimensional space, running around \u2013 you can encounter other people, but it still feels like a game, not a metaverse, because it\u2019s a kind of hermetically sealed IP, in a way. Whereas when people talk about metaverse, they\u2019re frequently talking about something where there\u2019s the possibility for different applications to kind of bump up against each other and interact with each other in a predictable and agreed upon way.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And do you, I\u2019m so fascinated by this topic in general, like a couple of questions I\u2019d love to ask you, like one \u2013 and I don\u2019t know whether this is a hard or easy question, is what role do you think AI plays as these metaverses become more prevalent?\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Well, AI is another term that can mean a lot of different things, and so it kind of depends. I mean, there\u2019s an old joke that, as soon as AI works, people start calling it software, and so AI is always kind of the next thing down the road, even though AIs of various kinds have found their way into practical use, sort of all over the place. \n\nSo, it can mean a lot of different things. In games, it means sort of any behaviors on the part of non-player characters, or even the environment that in some way create an illusion of responsiveness, and so, its usage in games is pretty loose and pretty forgiving. A technical researcher might have a different point of view on what that means. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: One of the things that you\u2019ve described in Fall is this fictional collapse of the internet and the information networks of that world, because of information overload and the sort of bifurcation of belief systems, you know, that there\u2019s this sort of shaky notion of objective reality, and you know, you\u2019ve got half of the population who believes a set of things that are unilaterally opposed to what the other half believes, and that in one half of the population, like you imagine that you would have to have some sort of mediating agent that helps you interpret all of the information that\u2019s flying at you. So, like you don\u2019t go onto the internet like someone, or something goes on the internet on your behalf to like to help you get through all of the druck to like real information.\n\nDo you think that that is a thing that \u2013 you know, either for metaverse or like the larger information ecosystem that we\u2019re going to have to have in the future?\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: I don\u2019t know if that particular system is the answer. I mean, what\u2019s described in Fall is the notion that you would have an editor and the more money you have, the more affluent you are, the better an editor you can afford, and poor people don\u2019t have any editors, and so they\u2019re just exposed to complete unfiltered garbage, and then that has the effect of making them poorer, in the long run. So, that\u2019s more of a \u2013 I think kind of a fictionalized depiction of where we are now.\n\nI guess my current thinking on this is that it\u2019s all driven by the incentives that you personally experience in your day-to-day life, and if you\u2019re in a line of work, somehow, or in a social situation where being able to tell fact from fiction is valuable to you, then you\u2019ll be more discriminating in how you interpret information that comes in off the internet, but if it doesn\u2019t matter, or if you\u2019ve got some sort of positive incentive to believe in garbage, then you\u2019re going to believe garbage. Nobody makes that choice \u2013 well, few people make that choice, because there\u2019s, you know, sort of altruistic seekers of truth that they chose what they\u2019re going to believe and how they\u2019re going to get information based on the social and economic incentives that they are faced with.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Do you think that\u2019s true, even of scientists? I mean like one of the \u2013 and like maybe again, it\u2019s all about incentives and social context, but like one of the fascinating things to me about how we\u2019ve tried to pursue science, not always to the highest standards since the Enlightenment, is like you just sort of have a structural system that encourages people to propose ideas in rigorous way and for other people to attack those ideas in an equally rigorous way so that you can get closer and closer to some kind of understanding of what might be reliably true, versus false.\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah, I think that\u2019s a good description of how it\u2019s supposed to work.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and so, like obviously, it doesn\u2019t work like that always. We can sort of see \u2013 you know, we can see at various points in time, like you know, that goal being perverted by politics or by, you know, what individual people are trying to accomplish that has nothing to do with truth-seeking, but do you think it\u2019s better for the world to have more of these sort of institutional things where the vector is towards reliable truth, versus not, or like that you only narrowly need it, like you said, in these sort of professions where there are real consequences for believing BS.\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah, I mean, this is \u2013 I\u2019m a big fan of an American philosopher named Charles Sanders Peirce, who wrote a piece in 1877 about how people believe things. It\u2019s called The Fixation of Belief, and I won\u2019t try to explicate the whole thing here, but the \u2013 kind of the gist of it is that the majority of people sort of believe what they\u2019re told to believe. And people of that mindset don\u2019t know what to make of the scientific method, because they\u2019re fixated on authority. \n\nAnd so, like a classic example of this is I saw some debate online a few weeks ago about John Locke, one of the, you know, founders of the whole kind of enlightenment worldview who had written some stuff about Africans that no one believes \u2013 no one, no sane person believes today. So, but it was fairly commonplace for people back then to have beliefs that, today we know are wrong. \n\nAnd so, someone was pointing to this as evidence that Locke, and by extension, the whole enlightenment project was wrong, top to bottom, because they were viewing the whole conversation through basically an authoritarian lens or the lens of someone who follows what Peirce would call the method of authority. And so, in that worldview, if you can discredit a particular authority, then you\u2019ve successfully discredited everything downstream of that authority.\n\nBut from the point of view of a scientific method kind of person, that\u2019s not how we think at all. What we respect is not any one particular exponent of this, not any one particular person or authority or any point of view that people believed in the past, but rather the process, the ongoing process that enables us to recover from mistakes and pick and choose what we think is currently supported by facts, and evidence and logic. \n\nSo, that\u2019s just a difference in mindset between followers of the method of authority versus followers of the \u2013 what Peirce would call fallible-ism, which is simply accepting the fact that you might be wrong. And so, you need some kind of system for figuring out whether you\u2019re wrong. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, that\u2019s super interesting. I mean, one of the things that I think about a lot is, whether we have chosen it as deliberately as we might have wanted to or not, we have a fairly \u2013 actually, not fairly, just an outrageously complex society built on layers and layers and layers of abstraction where, you know, just in the technical world, things have to be able to compose in predictable ways with one another in order for you to be able to deal with the next level of complexity that you\u2019re building the world on top of.\n\nAnd so, you have to have something like the scientific method to at least get the, you know, the interfaces between all of these things that have to compose right, because, like, there is no appeal to authority. You can\u2019t just\u2026 You know, and I think we\u2019re sort of learning that in, you know, like a bunch of our \u2013 like, the global economy, for instance. Like, you can\u2019t just wish that the global supply chain might do a particular set of things. It\u2019s very complicated. \n\nAnd, you know, one of the things that I think about a lot, and I don\u2019t know if, like, this is even a reasonable framing for things, but we live in this world of, like, this crazy stacking of complex abstractions, and we all depend on each other and the composition of those abstractions in incredibly complicated ways. And I think we underestimate how valuable it is to have a stable equilibrium where all of those things can continue to develop. And, like, the development just happens to accrue mostly to public good. \n\nAnd so, I just sort of worry a lot, and, like, I\u2019d love your take on this because I think you\u2019ve written about this in your books, of whether you think that we have the right incentives for people in their day-to-day lives who aren\u2019t looking at the \u2013 this incredibly complicated global picture. No one can because you can\u2019t fit all of the details into any human brain, but do you think we have the incentives set right where each of us can go out and do what we do well and have that ladder up into, like, a stable, prosperous world order? \n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: I think, kind of by definition among affluent, educated people, you know, people who work for tech companies or banks, or whatever, in \u2013 in the rich people economy that exists, albeit in a kind of ad hoc, you know, somewhat chaotic way, and it\u2019s all \u2013 that\u2019s almost tautology to say that because if you are plugged into that and you get it, you understand it, you\u2019re on the road to being a rich person, or at least a comfortable person. \n\nBut, you know, on the other side, again, there\u2019s a pretty large number of people who essentially can believe whatever they want to and not be aware that they\u2019re in a bubble and not really \u2013 it doesn\u2019t affect their fate one way or the other. And so, you get, in extreme cases, you get people just believing stuff that looks objectively crazy and wrong. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. It \u2013 the interesting thing to me for\u2026 probably the entire course of human history, and, like, certainly, this has been true since the Enlightenment, like you\u2019ve had these rational systems existing alongside irrational ones. And, like, there\u2019s at least been enough of a d\u00e9tente between the two systems where, you know, we can sort of make forward progress together. And I just wonder, like and I \u2013 I think, for me, it seems super hard to imagine, like, how you get every person to behave perfectly rationally. \n\nOne of my recent guests was Steven Pinker, who just wrote a really great book about rationality. And, like, I think everybody should read the book and, you know, sort of use the tools that he outlines in the book to try to get yourself to behave more rationally, but you know, in some sense, and, like, he even says \u2013\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: But \u2013 but if you\u2019re reading a book about thinking by Steven Pinker, you\u2019re, there\u2019s probably some self-selection already happening.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter.) Yeah. I mean, part of what I so appreciate in the work that you produce is, like, you\u2026 in your science fiction, you\u2019re not asking people to go through all of these cognitive tricks that Stephen is in his book to, like, be able to process the world that you\u2019re perceiving. You are asking people to be inspired by things, to, you know, let their imaginations free about what could be good and bad. And, you know, I think that plays an incredibly important role in, like, getting, you know, the rational and the irrational systems to have some kind of harmony with one another. \n\nSo, I don\u2019t know what you think about what we could do. Like, do we need more inspirational fiction? Do we need \u2013 like, what \u2013 what can we do to get things more balanced than they are right now, because I think about this a lot. I\u2019m sure you do, as well. It\u2019s hard to ignore how out of whack things are.\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah. I mean, for a while there, there was sort of a d\u00e9tente, as you put it, between kind of the scientific, rational world and big, established churches, like the Church of England, for example, and it wasn\u2019t always perfect. There was always some, you know, trouble along the blurry edges of things. But you can kind of see this negotiation process take place over time, as, you know, Darwin says, \u201coh, you know, evolution is a thing and the world is really old.\u201d And so, after some pushback and some \u2013 some grumbling, eventually, the \u2013 the church comes around to the view that, yeah, okay, the biblical account in Genesis is metaphorical. You know, the world is more than 6,000 years old. \n\nAnd so, there\u2019s this kind of progressive movement of the \u2013 the boundary between rational and irrational that takes place kind of slowly over centuries, but it only works if you\u2019ve got, you know, in the case of, let\u2019s say, England, you\u2019ve got an established church. And there\u2019s other churches as well and other faiths, but there\u2019s kind of one dominant church and the people who run that church go to the same universities with the physics professors and they know each other. And so they\u2019re able to kind of maintain this, what you call a d\u00e9tente. \n\nThat\u2019s not where we are now. And now, kind of social media allows anyone to start the equivalent of a church. And so, there\u2019s no way to establish kind of fixed boundary lines like that. So, and, you know, people \u2013 people try to sort of munge them all together into a movement like QAnon, and it kind of is there for a while and then sort of frays and \u2013 and falls apart. People go off and join other groups. \n\nSo I don\u2019t know what that future looks like in the situation we\u2019ve got now where there is no Archbishop of Canterbury to lay \u2013 or the pope, or what have you, to lay down the official theology. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it an interesting thing to think about, like, how destabilized the, you know, this, let\u2019s call it 250-year equilibrium that we\u2019ve had. Like, you know, maybe, maybe it isn\u2019t as destabilized as we think it is. But if it is, like, it\u2019s an interesting thing to think about what \u2013 you know, how we get to the next stable equilibrium. And I think it\u2019s a mix of, you know, technology and, you know, having some big problems that we\u2019re all going to go solve together, which need a mix of the rational and irrational.\ng\nAnd when I say irrational, like, I\u2019m not being pejorative because like I suspect both you and I, like I know me, at least, like, I have all sorts of irrational crap that I \u2013 \n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: No, you\u2019re using it as a shorthand for something else. I get it. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah. I mean, I was with you until COVID. (Laughter.) And then seeing people, like, dying because they heard on social media that vaccines were bad and refused to change their beliefs when people are dying all around them, and indeed, they\u2019re sick and literally on their deathbed really has changed my mind and has shaken me up a little bit because one wants to believe in a kind of sad, but satisfying version of that story where when people bump up against mortality and see friends and family dying or see that they might die, they finally sort of come to their senses, but that has not happened. \n\nSo I think it goes pretty deep and I don\u2019t know how we get out of that as long as social media continues to operate the way it operates today. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, the \u2013 the one counterpoint I would \u2013 I would offer this, and, like \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 this is \u2013 it\u2019s sort of funny. Like, I was hoping you were going to cheer me up, but, like, here, let me \u2013 let me try to \u2013 \n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: (Laughter.) Yeah, forget it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Let me try to cheer you up. (Laughter.) You know, I think all of what you just said is, like, it\u2019s very discouraging. It\u2019s incredibly dispiriting, but it\u2019s the same thing that happened in the Spanish flu. Like, I read a whole bunch of the historical documents around \u2013 so, I live in the Bay Area. Like, I\u2019ve read a bunch of the documents about how the public processed the Spanish flu in San Francisco, and the masking mandates, and the public health orders and whatnot. And it\u2019s very, very similar to what\u2019s going on right now. \n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: You might, just parenthetically, if you haven\u2019t read it, you should read Daniel Defoe\u2019s A Journal of the Plague Year \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Because it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s just hilariously on point, like paragraph after paragraph. It\u2019s just straight out of the early days of COVID, you know, 2020. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. F. Scott Fitzgerald had some really interesting letters that he wrote at the time. It\u2019s at the beginning of the pandemic, I read all of this stuff and I\u2019m like, wow, like, we\u2019ve learned nothing. And at the end of the pandemic, I was like, wow, we, you know, we did the same things back that and we\u2019ve had a whole century of, like, the most unbelievable progress that the human race ever had following that.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t believe necessarily that the pandemic and how we processed it is an indication that we\u2019re in some sort of\u2026\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Is anything new. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean \u2013 \n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I mean, and yeah, that\u2019s as hopeful as I can get because usually I\u2019m the one who\u2019s the pessimist. (Laughter.)\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: I\u2019d like to know, you know, like, what was the messaging that ordinary people heard, you know, back in those days. When they went to church, you know, were the sermons, you know, did people talk about this and suggest that they wear masks or were there the equivalent of anti-vaxxers at the time? Were the anti-vaxxers respected members of society or, you know, how did that whole picture look? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s, like, super complicated. My mother lives in rural central Virginia and is southern Baptist and is a devout believer. And she\u2019s, you know, a 70-something year old little southern church lady, right? But she is also triple vaxxed and like, defends her health perimeter fiercely. And, you know, she tells me these stories about her church community of these little old ladies, and there are a bunch of folks who are like her and there are a bunch of folks who are not like her. And, you know, they get a little frustrated with one another, but they figured out how to have a d\u00e9tente of some sort. And, like, that actually gives me hope, a lot of hope.\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: We are almost out of time, and I had a couple more questions I\u2019d like to ask you. Like, one is, like, you, you know, by virtue of your job, like writing speculative fiction or writing these stories about futures that might be, you seem to always be thinking about what\u2019s next. So, like, what are you excited by, inspired by? Like, what do you think might be the interesting set of next things that, either good or bad, that we should be thinking about right now?\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Well, it does seem like the kind of thing that I should have an opinion about, right? (Laughter.) But my mind doesn\u2019t kind of work that way. I\u2019m still kind of reeling from COVID and trying to make sense of it all. So, I guess I\u2019m super curious to see whether the current crisis is the beginning of just a longer and deeper overall downturn, or is it something that we bounce back from in a creative and positive way. So, I don\u2019t claim to have any particular insight. With the 2016 election and some other things that surprised me, like COVID, I\u2019m kind of stepping back a little bit from any attempt to claim I know what\u2019s going to happen next, because clearly, I don\u2019t. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, I don\u2019t know. You seem to always have. Maybe what we need to do \u2013\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: I mean, I think a big one to watch and sort of a longer term kind of mega trend is carbon capture. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: I mean, Termination Shock is about solar geoengineering, which is kind of a temporary Band-Aid approach, but I\u2019m super curious to see how that plays out over the next couple of decades. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Totally agree with you there and I \u2013 I think the thing that we\u2019re seeing right now is there are some really powerful tools coming online that help with that problem. One of the things that we\u2019ve been tracking for three or four years now is if you pick up an issue of Science or Nature any given week, with greater frequency, you see people across a whole bunch of scientific disciplines using machine learning in places where they would have just used combinatorial optimization or numerical optimization in the past to, like, solve a problem like airfoil design or, you know, protein structure prediction or like, pick your thing.\n\nAnd you know, at least for these numerical optimization problems in physics, like, we don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s anything wrong with the differential equations that describe the physical systems, but the way that you use the differential equations to actually simulate something just requires a lot of tradeoffs. So they don\u2019t have closed-form analytical solutions, obviously, because they\u2019re all nonlinear and all kinds of wonky. \n\nSo, when you get into simulation space, you\u2019re making tradeoffs about physical scale or time scale or, like, available computation or whatnot. And people are really, now \u2013 like, I think it\u2019s going to really take off this year \u2013 are using machine learning to learn something about the structure of these problem spaces that can dramatically accelerate the performance of the simulation or optimization. \n\nAnd so, like, there are things that are already being published at conferences where, like, we can send you this paper, like a group at Caltech, they invented a thing that they call a neural operator for solving the Navier-Stokes flow equations for computational fluid dynamics. And they didn\u2019t get a 10 percent speed up or a factor of two speed up in performance without losing accuracy. Like, they got a thousand times speed up. \n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Wow. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, I think, you know, when you see things where your improvements come by orders of magnitude, like huge new things become possible. And like, we\u2019re seeing this generalize fairly well across a whole bunch of problems. And so like, you know, you think about carbon capture and, like, you need to design new catalysts and new materials and whatnot. It\u2019s exactly the sort of thing where, you know, if you can get a million X speed up on classical methods, it\u2019s great.\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah. I mean, once you get on the inside of the inside of current research, it can be incredibly exciting. And but it\u2019s kind of fragmented into a lot of different areas, right? So, you really have to be on top of things, on top of a particular area to understand and appreciate some of the advantages of what\u2019s going on. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, you know, the thing that I did after 2016 is I stopped spending any time at all on social media \u2013 (laughter) And I renewed my subscriptions...\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Good for you.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  ...to Science and Nature. And I was like, yeah, I\u2019m only going to consume information that is long form, preferably peer reviewed or produced with high editorial standards, because I was spending an inordinate amount of time consuming information that was sort of the, you know, the food equivalent of junk. Like, I wasn\u2019t learning anything. I wasn\u2019t, you know \u2013 it wasn\u2019t helping me be better at anything. \n\nAnd I think, you know, in that sense, you read Science and Nature every week and even through the course of the pandemic, it\u2019s really inspiring. Like, we\u2019re making a lot of progress. Like, the quality of the work is crazy good. That \u2013 that\u2019s my hope. (Laughter.)\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah, no, that\u2019s one of the oddities of our time, right, is that that sort of thing is going on and we\u2019re like creating mRNA vaccines in no time, you know, and saving millions of lives. So, and that is all co-existing with people who think that it\u2019s a hoax or that the vaccines have microchips, you know, in them. (Laughter.) So, it\u2019s an interesting picture, to be sure. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So, one final question before I let you go. I ask this of everyone. You obviously love your day job. I mean, it sounds like you don\u2019t suffer for your writing, that it\u2019s a thing you enjoy doing. But I\u2019m curious, outside of that, what are the things that you do for fun? \n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: I like building things. I like making physical objects. It might be, you know, packing together a little Arduino circuit or, you know, machining something or 3D printing something. And so, I have kind of a bunch of projects running in parallel at any given time in that vein. And I\u2019m you know, by design, not trying to have them be economically viable. I\u2019m not, you know, I\u2019m not trying to patent anything or create IP, you know, in an economic sense. I\u2019m just following my nose and working with likeminded people on making cool stuff.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: What sorts of things do you machine? \n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Well, I\u2019ve got a vertical machining center, a CNC machining center and a lathe. I\u2019ve got two different 3D printers, various other things that I have access to.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: What VMC did you buy?\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: A HAAS VF3. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Nice. Yeah, I\u2019ve got a little Datron Neo, which is only suitable for non-ferrous materials. \n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah, I\u2019ve also got a Shapeoko that\u2019s maybe similar to what you\u2019re talking about, wood and aluminum, plastic. But yeah, I\u2019ve got a few\u2026 I mean, you spend a certain amount of time just maintaining the tools themselves, but I\u2019ve always been interested in the weird physics of long, skinny like whips and chains, which dates back to things I was studying 20 years ago. So, I\u2019m playing with some of that. I\u2019m playing with some ideas in the area of carbon capture and just some artistic kind of hobby projects.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That is so super cool. Yeah, I mean, if you ever need to subcontract out any of your stuff, like I would be happy to try to help. (Laughter.)\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: Good to know. Yeah, thanks. Thanks for the offer, yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter.) Awesome. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us today. And thank you for doing what you do. You\u2019ve been a real inspiration to me over the years, and I hope to be reading Neal Stephenson books in the future until I\u2019m an old-ass man. (Laughter.)\n\nNEAL STEPHENSON: I hope to be writing them that long. So, thanks for your kind words. I enjoyed the conversation.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome. Thank you. \n\n[music]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Well, that was Kevin\u2019s conversation with Neal Stephenson. So, what a great conversation, first of all. It was really great hearing the two of you talk about different things, and I was actually kind of interested in the conversation you were having about the metaverse and I guess some of the unknowns and the opportunities about what that term even means, I guess, in our current context. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. He is obviously one of the people to talk to about the metaverse, because I think he\u2019s been so insightful in predicting what it might be and, like, at the same time, inspiring a bunch of people who are working on metaverse right now to do what they\u2019re doing. So, he\u2019s got this sort of inspire-influence thing happening simultaneously. \n\nBut, you know, I think one of the things that was really interesting for me to hear him say about the metaverse is that he doesn\u2019t believe that it\u2019s one monolithic thing and that metaverses may and probably will take a whole bunch of different forms. And, like, to me, that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s the exciting thing. It\u2019s like we\u2019re either at or right on the cusp of the technology for building these things being good enough for them to become ubiquitous. And the way that they\u2019re going to become really good is a bunch of developers and a bunch of creatives taking all of these technological components and making something great. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I totally agree. I had the same thought. I really liked that he was saying he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be just one thing because I think that\u2019s important. I think that when we look at what these future things will be, like, you know, in my lifetime, I think the most important thing that has happened has been the World Wide Web. \n\nAnd again, as you said, that was a bunch of different people, a bunch of different technologists, and artists and people coming together to build new things, but it wasn\u2019t just one idea. It wasn\u2019t just one, you know, concept. It could go in a bunch of different directions. And I think having those possibilities and having that ability to, I guess, kind of evolve is exciting. And that is what I think, why so many people are excited about the metaverse, whatever it might be.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And I think the thing that we all should remember is that every platform and technology ecosystem that has ever emerged has become great because you have this plurality of people creating on top of it. It\u2019s never about, like, one thing and one group\u2019s rules about the thing. It has to be open enough where everybody can get involved and help to shape it into, like, this rich, interesting direction. And, like, that  I think is \u2013 it\u2019s important to remember and it\u2019s exciting to think about. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I think that\u2019s a great point. I mean, if anything, I think you could almost make the argument that if you don\u2019t have that plurality, as you say, then it\u2019s not going to take off. It\u2019s not going to be successful because, as you point out, it\u2019s only been those things where we\u2019ve had everybody kind of working together and kind of doing their own things and building off of one another that you actually have something that really matters and can really change the world. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Totally agree. And even if a thing doesn\u2019t have the plurality of participation and influence and it takes off, it probably isn\u2019t going to be as great as it could be if it did. So, I\u2019m really excited about what the next handful of years is going to bring. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I am too, and I\u2019m also excited to, you know, see what future Neal Stephenson books will look like and what insights he will have for us, going forward. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, for sure. Like, I said there at the end, I hope I\u2019m reading Neal Stephenson\u2019s books until I'm a very old man. (Laughter.)\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Same. I mean, old woman, but I\u2019m right there with you because his work is incredible and he continues to do great work.\n\nAll right, well, that is all the time that we have today. Thank you to Neal Stephenson for sharing his time and insights with us. If you have anything that you\u2019d like to share with us, please e-mail us anytime at behindthetech@Microsoft.com. Thanks for listening. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: See you next time.\n\nEND\n\n"}
