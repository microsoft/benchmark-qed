{"episode": "Ep-58 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with William A Adams", "text": "WILLIAM ADAMS: When you fail, you need someone to say, that\u2019s all right, let\u2019s do it again, right? And this is something that typically, black and women businesses don\u2019t have, right? They struggled to do it once. They get burned. They\u2019re working at McDonald\u2019s, or they\u2019re back to general population. They don\u2019t try again, because they\u2019ve got obligations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we\u2019re going to get behind the tech. We\u2019ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what\u2019s happening today. Stick around.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello, and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m cohost Christina Warren, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And today we have a really exciting guest, William Adams. He\u2019s made some really, really important contributions to the field of computer science. And he is also a leader in diversity, equity and inclusion. And he\u2019s won awards and recognition for his work within programming and in D&I stuff, and he just launched a new venture studio aimed to help every Black person interested in having a career in business or technology get into the field. \n\nSo I\u2019m really excited to hear you two talk. I know you have a lot of history with William, Kevin. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, William was one of the first people I recruited into the Office of the CTO when I joined Microsoft, almost seven years ago. And he was an unbelievably valuable member of my team. But maybe more important than that, like William just taught me a ton. Like he was a source of tremendous inspiration. He\u2019s technically amazing, but his determination to go give back to people was absolutely extraordinary.\n\nSo I \u2013 like I can\u2019t wait to chat with him today. I miss him since he\u2019s been gone from Microsoft, and so it\u2019s always great to catch up. And like hopefully, we can hit on a few of these like inspirational topics, where everybody else can see what inspired me so much about William and the example that he sets for us all. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: William Adams is a software engineer, DEI innovator and philanthropist. He founded Adamation, where he developed customer enterprise apps and earned two patents. His contributions to the field there were later documented by the Computer History Museum. William was at Microsoft for more than 20 years and was recognized for rolling out critical XML code globally as well as for cofounding the Leap Apprenticeship Program which was named Microsoft\u2019s D&I Program of the Year in 2020.\n\nAbout a year ago he left Microsoft to create a venture studio aimed to help every Black person interested in having a career or business in technology get into the field and prosper.\n\nWelcome to the show, William. I\u2019m so glad to have you here today.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Thank you. I\u2019m happy to be here.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It feels like it\u2019s been a super-long time. I miss you.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Man! The love is mutual.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So we\u2019ve got a ton of stuff to talk about, but I always start the show by asking folks how they got into STEM in the first place. So tell us a little bit about like what lit the spark for you and, you know, we can go from there. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Okay, well, I\u2019m a child of the \u201860s. I was born in 1964, so before all the computer \u2013 you know, personal computer stuff and all that. So I started with like the chemistry set, the physics set. And mind you this is all when I was very young. So my mom, when I was probably eight, I said \"Hey, let\u2019s go to RadioShack I want to buy one of those electronic kits,\" right? So I was just kind of self-driven in that way, and it was probably because my dad was a typewriter repair man, so we had stuff in the house, but he passed away when I was seven. So from then on, I was just one of those precocious kids, you know? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. What did your mom do?\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: My mom was, she worked in Orange County, so she was a County Administrator. She started out as being a welfare \u2013 what do you call them? She would check on people who were on welfare. And eventually, she evolved into being, like, the office manager of Orange County. So very, very humble beginnings. You know, my mom was not into STEM. My dad was not into STEM. My dad was actually in World II, you know? He had joined the Navy when he was 16.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Wow. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: So you know, there\u2019s no history of STEM and my family other than my uncle, my mom\u2019s brother, and this will come back later in the history. So I just started out as a precocious kid doing wacky stuff on my own. I was very shy. So while other kids were out playing, I would play too, but then at the end of the day, I\u2019m going to go and play with my electronics kit, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It is interesting. Your parents are almost an ideal combo of values. So your dad was a mechanical tinkerer.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And like fixed things that people depended on to do their work, and your mother had this \u2013\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Social thing.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and like that\u2019s an interesting combo. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, have you ever thought about the extent to which that influenced some of your thinking about the world? \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Not really, until you just said it now, actually. When I think of my origin story and \u2013 you know what really motivated me? I mean, a Black child growing up in the \u201860s, there was plenty around me that was like social justice, this, that and the other thing. But yeah, I hadn\u2019t really thought of the combo like that before. But yeah, that probably \u2013 well, it definitely shaped me because, obviously, they were my parents, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So when did you first become interested in computers?\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: It was, the exact year escapes me, but it was my uncle said, \"I have this Commodore PET,\" if you want to go back into the annals of history, Chiclets keyboard, cassette tape drive. \"I have this kind of PET, would you be interested in it,\" because he was getting something new. And of course, I\u2019m like, \"Yeah!\" So for a few months I put pictures of Commodore machines up on my mirror because, like, \"It\u2019s coming, some day.\" So that was the entr\u00e9e to computers was the Commodore PET, way back then, early \u201870s, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And what were the first, what was it that attracted you to a personal computer? And like, what sort of programming did you start with? \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Well, the attraction was availability, of course, because no one else in my neighborhood had a computer at that time, right? And this was \u2013 by that time, we had moved to the more middle-class neighborhood as opposed to the barrio that we used to live in, but still, no one had computers, because they just weren\u2019t that common, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: But I was a really shy kid, you know, to the point where I couldn\u2019t even tell people my name. I would spell my name out for them with my eyes downcast, rather than say my name. You know, I was just very shy, even though I was in sports and stuff like that. And the computer is just one of those things, right? It\u2019s like you get to tell it what to do. It\u2019s your buddy. It\u2019s your friend. It does what you want, and you interact, and you learn, and you grow. So that\u2019s I think why the connection was made between me and the computer.\n\nThe first stuff I did was very low-level machine programming, and by machine, I mean, even before assembly language, right? It\u2019s like you have to encode the instructions by the numbers, you know, and the first things I did were graphics-oriented, put blocks on screens. I mean, this was the time of Pong, right? \n\nSo it\u2019s like, \"Oh, let me try to do what Pong does,\" that sort of thing, 6502 CPU chips.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: And then I think after that there were these books and magazines that had like games, right? Wumpus, Hexapawn, whatever \u2013 you know, the little adventure games. So you would type those in and then run the program and make a mistake and have to type the whole thing over again, and maybe save it to cassette. \n\nSo it was games. And then eventually I started fiddling with the hardware. So like I would hook up a joystick to the computer, mess with that, fry an input chip, go to the store, buy another input chip, you know, fry it again. So that sort of thing. So it\u2019s, earliest was just messing around and games. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, I want to touch on a couple of things that you just said, one of them, which is, you know, just an interesting thing to highlight because I think kids \u2013 like I think of my 13-year-old and my 15-year-old, like their mind would be blown by what you just said. So the way that you got to play games is you had this computer that was, by modern measures, like extraordinarily clunky and limited. And the games came to you printed in a magazine.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Printed, in a magazine, and you typed it in.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And you type them in, into the computer, and hoped you didn\u2019t make a mistake.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And you got to play the game.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah, that \u2013 it is kind of wild. I mean, 8k of RAM, and \u2013 you know, not very \u2013 not even one megahertz CPU, I mean, pretty slow. So you had to be very clever. And they\u2019re \u2013 most of them were text-based, but we also had some visuals, you know? If you were really clever about how to program that stuff. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But maybe the more important thing that you just said is, I think it\u2019s extremely important in kids forming an idea of what\u2019s possible, part of it is about access to things that will shape them. And part of it is about role models.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Absolutely.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And like being able to sort of see themselves in things. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so it was a really extraordinary time, when you were growing up, and when I was growing up, that all of a sudden, this new, interesting thing was accessible. And like making technology accessible to kids, I think is one of the most important things that we all can be doing. And I know it\u2019s something you think a lot about. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah, I mean, I thought about \u2013 before thinking about this podcast, I was like what about my history? And early on \u2013 I mean, I had my uncle. Even before that, when I was like seven or eight, there was this guy in my life, who was named Jackie Robinson, who was a Black dude, who was at UC-Irvine studying computers, and he\u2019d show me printouts of his Fortran programs, and he let me read his book, and it\u2019s like, okay, that was an influence, right? \nAnd then here\u2019s my uncle, \"Here\u2019s your \u2013 here\u2019s a computer,\" okay, that\u2019s an influence. And local to us, we \u2013 we lived in the city called Placentia, which is like at that time, a farming community, really, but it was right next to Rockwell International. So all my classmates, at least the white kids, were \u2013 their parents were engineers. And Rockwell had a program where they actually brought high school students in for kind of \u2013 not an internship, but it was a training program. \n\nSo I learned Fortran, key punch, the rocket equation, you know, calculators, all this stuff. So I was fortunate. I had access. And there it was, right? My circumstance would be completely different if that series of things didn\u2019t exist, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, and I think kids also are so impressionable when they\u2019re young. I mean, I remember my own journey. I got interested in computers, like a) because they were accessible, and b) because videogames seemed fascinating.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I just, you know, the thing that I always had from the time I was a like a super-little kid is I just wanted to understand how everything worked. And the more fascinated I was by the thing, the more I wanted to understand how it got made and how it functioned. And like video games were the initial thing that got me into computers, but I remember I got into a science and technology high school when I was a senior, and I did an internship as part of the Computer Science class and I was taking there, where half-a-day a week for six weeks I went to this place and worked with real adult professional engineers. \n\nAnd one of them had a copy of Allen Holub\u2019s compiler book, sitting on their desk, and I saw that, and I was like, \"This is the most mysterious thing that I\u2019ve ever seen in my life, and I must understand how these programming tools work that I\u2019m using and loving.\"\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And like, and that became \u2013 like, I was 17 years old, and that became the next 13 years of my life was studying compilers and programming languages. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah. And when you\u2019re young, you don\u2019t know how hard it is.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Like here I am, a 12-year-old kid, and I\u2019m writing \u2013 I\u2019m translating machine code. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s hard or not. I just know how to do it because I read the book and it says, \"Do the following,\" and it\u2019s like, \"Oh, okay,\" right? So it\u2019s like, it\u2019s great to have a plastic mind when you\u2019re young, but that plastic mind needs to be fed with stuff to spark it towards, you know, interesting directions, right? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: So yeah. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, so let\u2019s talk about college. And what did you study? And I know like part of your journey is like, not only were you becoming a better and better programmer over time, but like you were thinking about \u2013 you know, \"How do I become an entrepreneur? Like, how do I make money at this stuff? How do I start businesses? Like what are the useful and interesting things that I can do with this thing that I love?\"\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah, I have a prop that I wanted to show you that I\u2019m sure you can appreciate. I went to college with this Commodore 64.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Nice. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Now, this isn\u2019t the actual one, but I got it off eBay because it\u2019s nostalgic. It\u2019s like, \"I\u2019ve got to get one of those again.\"\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: So I went off to college and Electrical Engineering, Computer Science. And it was interesting at that time, UC-Berkeley, because I remember my math teacher in high school, Dr. Jim Jenkins. He was a guy who had worked on the Manhattan Project, drove to school in a Rolls Royce every day, you know, because he was just giving back to the system, as you said.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: It was public school. He went to UC-Berkeley. So I was inspired. And I went to Berkeley, and he said, \"Computer Science? There\u2019s no such thing,\" you know? So this is 1982, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and he right, there wasn\u2019t \u2013\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: That\u2019s right, there wasn\u2019t Computer Science, but you know, they \u2013 they had some computers, and you\u2019re programming, DEC PDP-10s, flipping switches, you know, and then eventually they got terminals, and that was the birth of UNIX and all that sort of stuff. But at that time, we were learning \u2013 I think I learned Pascal \u2013 yeah, I learned Pascal there, and there was this other language called C that you\u2019re supposed to learn on your own, you know, and it was just a heyday of a lot of inventions in \u2013 not the internet, but ARPANET, all that stuff was happening then. \n\nAnd as college students, we were surrounded. This was in the Bay Area, so we\u2019re surrounded by all these companies popping up. I mean, certainly Apple, you know, and they weren\u2019t as huge as they are today. Adobe, you know, Sun Microsystems, all these companies. So it was just natural for all of us to go, \"Okay, I\u2019m going to do startup,\" right? And it was different from what we think today, right? At that time, we\u2019re like, \"I\u2019m going to change the world,\" and you know, we\u2019re starry-eyed and all that sort of stuff. So my brother and I, you know, he said, \"Well, you know how to program. He knows how to sell. Let\u2019s go do that,\" right? So we just started our first company, Adamation, did some custom software development for the people that owned the building that our office was in, and it just kind of went on from there. \n\nYou know, it was like, \"This is just what you do. Let\u2019s go make some money,\" right? Now, of course, in the early years, we just starved. I mean, quite \u2013 we had four employees, and I quite literally, for at least a year or two in there, we had Chip-A-Roo cookies and popcorn for lunch. That\u2019s all we could afford. You\u2019d walk down to the store \u2013 Chip-A-Roo cookies, a bag was like a dollar-fifty. Popcorn was maybe a dollar. And I would ride my bike home at night, literally looking in the gutter for a dollar so I could buy a doughnut to have for dinner, right?\n\nIt\u2019s like, we\u2019re going \u2013 we\u2019re going to do this this thing, that we\u2019re dedicated, right? That\u2019s how it was for a few years, but over time, we actually succeeded. We became big dogs in a little \u2013 or big fish in a small pond of NeXT Computers, and then we went on from there, but it was just a natural flow. It\u2019s like, \"I\u2019m learning stuff. I know how to program. I\u2019ve got friends who can program. The world is our oyster, let\u2019s go get it,\" right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about why NeXT, versus \u2013 so again, this is another interesting thing for the young folks. The number of platforms and types of computers and different types of microprocessor instruction set architectures that were out there when you were doing all of this was way more diverse than it is now. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, you could have chosen to do a lot of things. You could have done PC software, you could have done MAC software, you could have done like UNIX stuff on a bunch of different UNIX systems that were becoming popular then, but you chose to work on NeXT \u2013\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: This niche market, NeXT \u2013 and that comes from \u2013 while I was at UC-Berkeley, I managed the computer store there. And so I was familiar with Apple. So I knew all those people. And you know, I wouldn\u2019t say I was a Steve Jobs fanboy, but I knew Steve Jobs. And then when he went off to do NeXT, you know, he was kind of pushed out of Apple, we thought \u2013 we literally said, \"We don\u2019t know what you\u2019re gonna do next, you might be selling, you know, bat guano to Eskimos. I know, it\u2019s going to be exciting, we\u2019re going with you,\" right?\n\nSo as he did NeXT Computers \u2013 and of course, Steve Jobs, for anyone who knows, was quite the showman, you know, not in a fluffy way there\u2019s like, there\u2019s no \u2013 there\u2019s no steak with that sizzle. It\u2019s like he knew what he was talking about. And he knew what people really wanted. He had a sense of style, right? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: It\u2019s like, \"Whatever you do, Steve is probably going to be good. We\u2019re in.\" That\u2019s what drove us, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, and NeXT was a really interesting company. I mean, as \u2013 so Apple ultimately bought NeXT.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: A whole bunch of the \u2013 of NeXT team, you know, like Craig Federighi, for instance, are still at Apple doing interesting stuff today, but you know, they \u2013 the \u2013 they had beautiful industrial design.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: There were two machines, so the NeXT Cube and the NeXT Station.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah,\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So one was a cube, and one was a pizza box, but it was \u2013 the, the back end of the operating system was UNIX. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It had a really nice graphical user interface. They embraced object-oriented programming super early.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So like they were innovating and doing a bunch of interesting things and putting a bunch of pieces together that are exactly the pieces that are together now that \u2013 you know, are the basis of what we use every day.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And there was at that time, they introduced this thing called App Builder, which was the way of visually putting your application together by dragging and dropping, and all that sort of stuff. And today we go, yeah, of course. But at that time, it didn\u2019t exist, right? So they were innovating in that sort of way. And Steve also did things like he said, \"You should think of your \u2026\" \n\nHe had a sense for how apps should work. \"You should be no more than one click away from achieving some action.\" So he hated like, endless lists of menus, and all that sort of stuff. It was like one click, direct action is the way things should work, so you know, there were certain things about the platform Display PostScript, like you said, the networking model.\n\nThey have this thing called Speaker Listener, and it was a way of passing messages back and forth, even across the network. So yeah, there was a lot of innovation. And it allowed us to create apps that would come out and take two or three months instead of a year.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: It was quite literally that dramatic of a difference. And we even won \u2013 our company won an award. I can\u2019t even remember what it was. It was the DB Expo way back then. We won an award for Best In Breed because of this database app stuff that we did. And it was because of object-oriented, you know, dynamic this, that and the other thing, and the way we connect things together. \n\nSo yeah, it was \u2013 they had tons of Innovation that is now lasting, right? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: So yeah, that\u2019s why \u2013 that\u2019s why I did NeXT, because it\u2019s like, \"This is going to be where it\u2019s at,\" you know?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and you know, it \u2013 NeXT wasn\u2019t a super-successful company in the grand scheme of things.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But it was a super-influential company.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah, the DNA lived on, but they didn\u2019t get the commercial success. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So you were pretty prescient in figuring that out.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah, I mean I did one more before I went off to Microsoft, which was the Be Operating System, BeOS \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Which was another that was \u2013\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Another one of those things.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e that was his company, right?\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah it was Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e, Steve Sakoman, I forgot, Erich [Ringewald] \u2013 I forgot Erich\u2019s last name, but yeah \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That was a brilliant operating system, like I never had one, but I always wanted a Be Box, like it was such a cool computer.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: I still have one. I have one, down in the basement.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Dude.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah, they were innovative in quite a few things. They were one of the first people to come out with a PC that was multiprocessing. It had two CPUs in it. And then they also had quite a lot of innovation in the UI, in terms of speed. This guy, Benoit Schillings, who later did Qt, did the UI for the BeOS. This other guy, Dominick [Giampaolo] \u2013 oh, what is Dominick\u2019s last name? \n\nAnyway, they had this operating system that had \u2013 it was journaled, for one, so it was kind of crash proof. And they also had tagging, so you could attach tags to things, which made it really interesting. So, they did a lot of innovations. Of course, they didn\u2019t win. They were \u2013 we were right there at that battle between is Apple going to buy NeXT or Be, and they bought NeXT. And that was the end of Be, essentially.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So, how did you end up at Microsoft?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWILLIAM ADAMS: So, as I was \u2013 I exited Be in, what was it, \u201896, I guess, maybe \u201897. And I was \u2013 because something happened there. It was like, ah, this is not a good place for me. So then, I was sitting around just kind of programming along, you know, compiling Linux and whatnot at home. And I had a friend at Microsoft, Chris Lovett, who said, \u201cHey, we\u2019re working on this XML thing. You want to come join?\u201d And I said, \u201cThat sounds interesting.\u201d (Laughter.) \n\nSo, I went up, did the interview, and was, like, yeah, okay, and this was right at the time where \u2013 it was 1998. So, recession is coming, .com bubble is inflating and about to burst. Microsoft is under investigation by the DOJ, about to be split up, you know, and I thought, that place is going to be \u2013 either they\u2019re going down in flames, or they\u2019re rising like a phoenix. Either way, it\u2019s going to be a fun ride. So, I jumped off to Microsoft.\n\nAnd it was also, I had a child. You know, these are my earning years. I\u2019m 30-something. It\u2019s like, well, this is my last chance to actually go get some dollars, you know, and not starve. So, I\u2019d better go, you know, do that thing. So, I did. That\u2019s how I came, because someone asked me to come.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and I think, again, that\u2019s it \u2013 we, in a minute, are going to get to all of the DEI stuff and, like, inclusion and access. But, like, that is another thing: network matters. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Network matters, absolutely. Yeah. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Network, like being connected to people who not necessarily are, like, passing you opportunities, but just making you aware of what some of the interesting things are that you might not otherwise see, and, like, we want to work with you. Like, it\u2019s just an amazing thing to have.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah. And this Chris Lovett, I had met actually at Taligent, another Silicon Valley also-ran. And he was impressed with the work that I brought there from Adamation. And it was just that, right? It\u2019s, like, he\u2019s thinking, oh, that guy, William, he\u2019s kind of interesting. Why don\u2019t I give him a call? And then the opportunity is up to me to take it or not, right? It\u2019s to impress or not impress. But yeah, network is super important.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, tell us a little bit about the XML work that you did. So, it was, like, really central infrastructure, like, a thing that was \u2013 \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: At that time. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: At that time, that was very important to how the, you know, the sort of emerging network infrastructure was operating.\u00a0\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah, I mean, XML, you know, the easiest way for \u2013 to put it in context is to say, well, HTML was important for the UI \u2013 the UI browser, right? XML was the equivalent for data transmission and sharing. Now, it went further and created things like SVG, which is the graphics format, and the Office \u2013 all their documents are actually XML formatted documents. They\u2019re in a ZIP file, so you don\u2019t realize it, you know, but they\u2019re actually just XML. \n\nSo, at the time, we were trying to do a couple of things, but primarily just being able to wrangle data, right, add some amount of structure and schema to data that otherwise is just kind of out there. And by structuring things with XML, you make it easier for intercompany communications or intracompany communications, and on and on. \n\nWe went a bit too far. It got too cumbersome. Along came JSON, and now JSON\u2019s that, right? But XML was super important at that time, right? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, and also in a bunch of subtle ways. I mean, like, one of the things that Microsoft did in Internet Explorer, like, with XML, adjacent to XML is, like, this thing called the XML HTTP request, which is \u2013 \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Oh yeah, that was the most important thing, because that allows you to program the Web, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Correct. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: And now people, it\u2019s like, well, you don\u2019t even think about it. But at that time, yes, the HTML request was like, oh, this is different \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 because before that, there was no way to really, or at least, there wasn\u2019t a real standardized way of saying, I\u2019m going to call this function over there, right? So, yeah.\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Correct. And you know, again, just to pull back, like, this was the way where you could write an application in JavaScript that ran in your browser, that could then interact with something running in the cloud.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWILLIAM ADAMS: So, we didn\u2019t even have the cloud at that point, right? (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, the cloud \u2013 yeah, nobody was calling it this silly name yet.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah, so it was the birth of that. It\u2019s kind of funny, what you\u2019re telling me is, like, well, there was the XHTML, you know, requesting. I\u2019m like, yeah, no, we did that. (Laughter.) There\u2019s so much history in there that it\u2019s like, yeah, we did that, too. And we did that, and we did that.\n\nLittle known fact, I was granted a \u2013 after doing this XML stuff and some other stuff, my then-GM at the time, Dave Reid, said, \u201cHey, come up with something.\u201d (Laughter.) So, he gave me free license. He said, \u201cPick your top six people, and go do something interesting.\u201d And he had gotten some commandment from Bill Gates or whoever at the top, do something that helps us fight against Java at that time. \n\nAnd so, we went to do something that was really like, that would be hard for Java to do quickly, right? So, we ultimately came up with this thing, which is now called System.Linq. And I know you had Anders Hejlsberg on in the very beginning, and he talked about this. So, we worked with Anders and some other people, and came up with this way of changing your programming, such that your data types had nullable types. And we had things like lambda expressions, and there was \u2013 it was pretty easy to do database stuff, and XML integration, and blah, blah, blah. And that was something that Java couldn\u2019t do easily. \n\nSo, that was birthed out of this same set of people that were doing this XML work. They then prototyped the System.Linq stuff.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s awesome, super cool. So, we\u2019ll fast forward through a whole bunch of stuff. So, you and I first met when I came to Microsoft and was appointed CTO, and I was recruiting the first people into the office of the CTO. And I borrowed this concept that Bill Gates originated a long while back, which when he was running the company, he always had a technical adviser. And his technical adviser was basically, like, an avatar that he would send off into this org to go dive deep on things, and to come back and, like, help him make sure that he understood technically what\u2019s going on, and that he had an independent point of view about the technical goings on inside of Microsoft, aside from what he\u2019s being told by the teams that are working on stuff.\n\nAnd, you know, at the point that I was CTO, like, the company was, or when I was appointed CTO, the company was, like, really big. And so, I was, like, all right, I not only need a technical advisor, I need lots of them. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah. (Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And you were one of my very first technical advisors. And, you know, I want to talk a little bit about what you did and what was appealing to you about that role. But I also want to focus on this amazing thing that you brought with you, which is a program called LEAP, which is a new way to do recruiting, which flips a whole bunch of things around on its head and, like, results in not only hiring amazing people, but just by the nature of how you\u2019re doing the recruiting, you tend to get a more diverse and inclusive set of people coming in, because you are not relying on\u2026\n\u00a0\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Traditional paths, is the easiest way to\u00a0say it. (Laughter.) \n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, filters that have systemic biases, like not evil ones, but just they\u2019re there. And so. \n\u00a0\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah, so I\u2019ll pick up the story from the\u2026 I got an e-mail. (Laughter.) I think it was from Fatima, who sad, \u201cOh, would you be interested in you know, working in the office of the CTO?\u201d And to be honest, I was, like, oh, we have a CTO, you know?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Right. (Laughter.) \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Because Microsoft doesn\u2019t always have, you know, and it was, like, Ray \u2013 not Ray Kurzweil. Ray Ozzie was a previous one. So, I was, like, oh, okay. And honestly, I thought it was a prank mail until I actually called and talked to her. And it\u2019s, like, oh, okay, you know. And I remember, we \u2013 you and I had this conversation. And I said, \u201cWell, you know, I\u2019m really interested. Can I bring this LEAP thing with me?\u201d And probably, you were like, yeah, whatever. (Laughter.) Poor you. You know, I don\u2019t know if you really realized what it really was. But that was the one condition. And you said yes.\n\nAnd now, LEAP and start in 2015. And I\u2019ll come back to the CTOs office. And it was this\u2026 The challenge with LEAP was I went to a CVP, Girish Bablani, and said, \u201cHey, what\u2019s one of our business challenges?\u201d And he said, \u201cOh, there\u2019s this, you know, diversity thing, right? Like, we need a little bit more diversity in our engineering talent.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, okay.\u201d \n\nNow, I\u2019m, at that time, what, approaching 50. I think it was about 50 at that time. And until that point, I had not really been thinking, even though I\u2019m a black guy in tech, I hadn\u2019t really been thinking about my responsibility for bringing my tribe into engineering. I hadn\u2019t \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a deep thought for me, honestly. \n\nSo, I started this thing, just thinking of it as some challenge. And it turns out that what was missing in our hiring processes was we hired from college. We go to the top 15 schools, like everybody else. Well, they look a certain way, and they are a certain way. You\u2019re not going to find much diversity beyond whatever you find there, right? \n\nSo, I thought, well, let\u2019s \u2013 where are the people? Where are the women and minorities? Well, they\u2019re in other careers. They\u2019re at coding academies. They\u2019re at, you know, community colleges. They are STEM ready; they\u2019ve got degrees. They just didn\u2019t slipstream into our college intern program. And they\u2019re not college hires, so you\u2019ll never find them, right? \n\nSo, what was missing was essentially an internship program for professionals who weren\u2019t just fresh out of college, right? That was the premise, and that\u2019s what LEAP became. It\u2019s essentially a 16-week apprenticeship program. And it just turns out that that model worked, right? So, that\u2019s what LEAP is, and we can go further into that. \n\nIn the office of the CTO, I thought from the beginning is actually what you said, which is, you need to go out, you need to synthesize, right? You need to go over the landscape, because Kevin can\u2019t read and be in every single meeting. And if you are in a meeting, they\u2019re going to tell you what they think the executive wants to hear. They\u2019re going to prep, you know, kind of sugarcoat. You\u2019re not going to get the God\u2019s truth. \n\nBut when you\u2019re a TA, and you go in with a different approach, you know, and of course, you\u2019re leveraging some relationships that you have with people, so you can get the insider\u2019s story and all that sort of stuff, and then you can synthesize. And I often describe it to people as we\u2019re like the Supreme Court\u2019s Clerks, right? The Justice doesn\u2019t have time to read all the case law. And they need their clerks to do a lot of the legwork, and then feed them something and say, well, here\u2019s \u2013 you know, and then the Justice forms their opinion. That\u2019s how I viewed the job. It\u2019s, like, oh, we\u2019re like the Supreme Court Justice\u2019s clerks, right?\n\nAnd I think it was useful to you. I don\u2019t know because I\u2019m not you, but I thought we were doing a useful job.\u00a0(Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, it \u2013 like, it is the only way that I can do my job, is having \u2013 having all of the fantastic TAs who work in the office of the CTO. And it\u2019s a hard job to do, I think, because you have to be technically excellent. You have to be able to, you know, go into a situation, and absorb a whole lot of new information very quickly and synthesize it into something. \n\nAnd you have to, like, maybe even do the harder thing, which is, like, show up and do something valuable enough for the team that you\u2019re showing up to, that they are willing to authentically share real information with you versus to being wary of you. It\u2019s, like, oh, you\u2019re the emissary of some bald headed exec, who\u2019s seeking to make my life more difficult.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Right, how do we shut you out?\u00a0(Laughter.)\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And, you know, like, I think it was one of the things that was sort of surprising to me. I\u2019ve said this to a whole bunch of people over the years at Microsoft. The thing that I was actually counting on when I became CTO, because the surface area of technology at Microsoft is so vast that people would \u2013 that everybody would basically have the same reaction that you did. \n\nIt\u2019s like, A, I didn\u2019t know we had a CTO; and B, like, can we just please make this person leave us alone for as long as humanly possible, which would then let me select into, like, what I thought were the highest priority things to go figure out first. \n\nAnd, like, the unusual thing about Microsoft is we had lots of people who wanted to engage with the office of the CTO, like, very quickly. It was overwhelming. So, if I hadn\u2019t had, like, all of you excellent TAs, like, it would have just been too daunting.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah, I mean, in the guts of forming that office, I mean, if you asked what else I did, it was the TA part. And it was also, since the office \u2013 there\u2019s no playbook for the office of the CTO. It\u2019s not, like, hey, Kevin\u2019s the CTO, and here\u2019s the description of how an office of the CTO should run. So, we spent quite a lot of time amongst ourselves, just trying to figure out, well, what should we be focused on? What is the right use of our energies? And how should we operate? How do we evaluate whether we\u2019re being impactful or not? \n\nAnd one of the key things we did, or you did for us, was to lay out, it\u2019s not really a manifesto, but it was the words that said, you know, how we operate, right, which was go in with humility, listen, you know, don\u2019t go in with a sledgehammer. All that sort of stuff laid the groundwork for, and I think why the office of the CTO is successful. What, we\u2019re six, seven years in now?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Almost, yeah.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah, so it\u2019s like most offices of the CTO that Microsoft has had didn\u2019t last that long, and it\u2019s because they were different. Like, Ray Ozzie, for example, ended up trying to become a product team. So, the people he was supposed to be serving were now his competitors, right? It\u2019s, like, well, that\u2019s not your Kevin Scott\u2019s office of the CTO. You stuck with the, look, man, I\u2019m here to serve, right? (Laughter.) And I think that\u2019s super important.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I think, you know, we can talk a bit about this.\u00a0Companies need a mix of different things in order to be successful. So, obviously, you have to have product teams who make product, and you have to have people who sell them. And you have to have, you know, human resources teams that, like, help hire the people and retain them, and make sure that they are, you know, happy and content, or, like, wherever they need to be on that spectrum, and, you know, have what they need in order to continue doing the job. \n\nAnd so, like, there are all of these different roles. And the question I think we\u2019ve always asked ourselves in the office of the CTO is, like, is the thing that we\u2019re doing, the role that we\u2019re serving for the company, is it important? And if it\u2019s important, then it\u2019s pretty clear that you don\u2019t evolve it into something else, because if you did, then you\u2019d have to go find someone else, or, like, some other group to go do the thing that you were doing that five seconds ago was important.\n\nAnd so, the important thing that the office of the CTO does is it sort of thinks about technology strategy across the full breadth of the company. It thinks about time horizons that are a little bit longer than maybe product teams are more accustomed to thinking about, because they have a set of urgencies around business deliverables. \n\nAnd, you know, like, the thing that I\u2019ve always said for Satya is, like, just I will go do things that need to be done that aren\u2019t getting done otherwise. It\u2019s like why I\u2019m doing a bunch of AI stuff right now. It\u2019s why I ran the Search group for a little while, like, but I\u2019ve always thought that \u2013 you know, and it\u2019s sort of true for TAs as well. \n\nSo, when you\u2019re a TA, you\u2019re not running a thing. And there are lots of super senior people, like you, who became TAs. And so, if you get to the point where you want to run something, again, like, the thing that we\u2019re not going to do is build a group inside of the office of the CTO.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Right. You go back into general population. (Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Correct. (Laughter.) \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Right? Yeah, I think that\u2019s super important. And I \u2013 there\u2019s two things that I wanted to observe while you were talking. It\u2019s like, I remember from day one, not day one, but day two, your emphasis on AI, right? So, for seven years now, from the beginning, I think one of the first conversations we had was about AI. And it\u2019s like, that\u2019s this forward look that you\u2019re saying. And now everything is AI, right? \n\nAnd I think that\u2019s super important, to be able to have a look forward, because like you said, the product teams, it\u2019s harder for them to do that, right, because they\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019ve got quarterly obligations, and they can look maybe a year or two in advance. But they can\u2019t look 10 years in advance. It\u2019s too hard. \n\nI forgot the other point, but it was really interesting. So, it\u2019ll come back.\u00a0(Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and look, the other thing, too, is, you know, you have to think about a bunch of different time horizons. So, I run Microsoft Research, or, like, I don\u2019t run Microsoft Research. Peter Lee runs Microsoft Research. And Peter, you know, has generously consented to report to me, which is, you know, how things work in the real world. \n\nAnd so, yeah, the job of Microsoft Research is to take large intellectual risk, so to, like, really go have wild ambitious ideas. And when you\u2019re trying to have wildly ambitious ideas, like, a whole bunch of them don\u2019t work. And so, like, that\u2019s one time horizon. So, like, the \u2013 you know, the big bold bets, you know, if you get a few of those right over the course of a decade, like, they really change the nature of how an organization works. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s sort of the medium time horizon stuff, which is, you have a technology like AI. And if you\u2019re a platform company, like, Microsoft it\u2019s easy to imagine if AI, you know, is on a particular trajectory, you\u2019re going to want to have the technology be well represented in your platform, because it\u2019s going to be very important in how people build software. \n\nAnd, you know, there, you just have to be very \u2013 it\u2019s not a thing where you\u2019re like, okay, well, this is some wild bet, and, like, we can afford for it to fail. It is a thing where you have to be very disciplined year after year about how you\u2019re going to go get after this thing, and make sure that you\u2019re tracking everything that\u2019s going on in the \u2013 \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Oh, you\u2019re market making, right? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Correct.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: You\u2019re not following, you\u2019re market making at that point. And that\u2019s, like you said, the word \u201cdiscipline.\u201d It\u2019s like, you\u2019ve decided that the market is going to be a certain way, and you\u2019re going to make it that way. And you have to have the discipline. And you also have to have the foresight or discipline to be able to say, it\u2019s not going our way, you know? (Laughter.) And you correct for it. \n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Correct. And you have to be unbelievably truthful with yourself about that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Right, or else you end up wasting billions chasing elephants or whatever. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: So, the other point I wanted to make about something I did in the office of the CTO was do you remember Africa? (Laughter.) \n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh yeah, tell the story, please. This is so important.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWILLIAM ADAMS: (Laughter.) So, Africa was interesting. There\u2019s African engineers within Microsoft who came to me, you know, to say, \u201cOh, William, you know, you\u2019re office of the CTO, maybe you can help us out, you know, your influence, blah, blah, blah.\u201d And they basically said, \u201cLook, the continent of Africa has zero engineers on it. The whole continent, one point however many billions of people, however big Africa is, which, you know, a third of the planet, or whatever it is, no engineering from Microsoft. We think this is a problem because we\u2019re not leveraging the smartness that\u2019s there.\u201d \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Which is very, very interesting, because, like, we have \u2013 we have a couple of\u2026 more than a couple, but, like, you know, the folks that I\u2019m \u2013 that I work closely with. So, we had Hoop [Somuah], who was Satya\u2019s TA when I became CTO.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah, right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hoop was from Nigeria?\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: He\u2019s from Ghana.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Ghana.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: But yeah, close enough. (Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And then, you know, one of our technical fellows, like, the highest individual contributor rank in the entire company is \u2013 \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Abolade. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Abolade Gbadegesin. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, like, it was really interesting that, like, we had these very senior, like, extraordinarily accomplished engineers from Africa, and, like, you know, like you said, no presence on the continent or, like, engineers there, building things for us.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Right, and they\u2019ve been trying for \u2013 that group, Hoop, Abolade, there\u2019s another guy who\u2019s named Bambo, there\u2019s a few others. So, they\u2019ve been trying, literally for 10 years, to convince Microsoft to do engineering in Africa, open up a dev center, something like that. And I kind of got involved with them. And I was, like, \u201cOh, well, the problem is you\u2019re doing it wrong.\u201d (Laughter.) They would have meetings all the way up and down the executive chain, but they weren\u2019t in a position to actually just go and hire some people, right? \n\nSo, I got involved. And I said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go take a trip.\u201d And we went to Nigeria and Kenya in one week, and had all these conversations, talked to a lot of people, and said, \u201cOkay.\u201d I came \u2013 I said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to do this.\u201d \n\nI came back, and I actually went to you and said, \u201cLook, Kevin, I want to do this stuff in Africa. I\u2019m not asking for anything from you. I just don\u2019t want you to say no.\u201d Do you remember that? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I do.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: And you said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to say no,\u201d right? (Laughter.) And so, I then went on to hire people in Kenya to start, and we actually did it through LEAP. That\u2019s where I got the money from, actually. And then \u2013 and this wasn\u2019t the only thing happening at that time. There are other things, but this kind of pushed it. \n\nThe Windows group was already kind of leaning in towards it. And then this \u2013 Mike Fortin got involved. He was an exec in Windows, and then we brought the company, right? And now I think between the two sites, Kenya and Nigeria, we have 650 engineers.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Which is incredible. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: It is. It\u2019s amazing that that happened, and it\u2019s only been, like, four years, you know?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: I was there in 2006 for the bring up of the India Development Center, not bring up, but the \u2013 helped it grow. At the time I joined there, it was 1,000. By the time I left, it was like 2,500, so over three years. It takes a lot to establish an engineering center, particularly in a place where you went from zero, right? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: So, Africa was really important for me, because it was a \u2013 I thought: you have to go to where the talent is. And it\u2019s going to be in Africa. It\u2019s one of the youngest places on the planet. You know, there\u2019s a lot of them. You have to assume there\u2019s a number of geniuses on the continent, because we already had proof in the company that there were, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: So, it was just a good harvest. And so, that was the Africa story. It\u2019s like, I\u2019m super happy that you didn\u2019t say no, right? (Laughter.) And I was enabled to go off and do something like that. It\u2019s super important, you know, and now it is something, so.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, and we were just lucky that we had someone with an entrepreneur\u2019s mindset like you, who thought that it was an interesting problem and went, because it really was not one big obstacle, like me saying no.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: (Laughter.) It was several. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. You know, like, you just had to go get a bunch of medium, small, big things all lined up. And it\u2019s a lot of work.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah. Yeah, and they all lined up. We even did a promotional video and all this sort of stuff. And it was quite an extraordinary thing. And I think the \u2013 I mean, hopefully, we get to talk about WaveStudio, but it \u2013 it\u2019s all about enabling genius, wherever it is, right? It\u2019s like, let\u2019s get the full value of human intelligence, no matter where it is on the planet, right? I mean, that\u2019s what I\u2019m after these days.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So, we evidently have not talked fast enough. (Laughter.) We\u2019re coming \u2013 so, I want to talk at least for a few minutes about what you\u2019ve been doing since you left Microsoft, because it\u2019s, like, fascinating and important work. And, you know, I think we\u2019ve got another five minutes or so.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah, well, let me put on my speed mouth then. The general  thing is, and this started back with when George Floyd was killed. I kind of really sat and thought, it\u2019s like, okay, what am I going to do? I mean, this is not the first black man who\u2019s ever been killed by police. He\u2019s not going to be the last, but this is a good moment, because it was caught on 4K video. People are kind of paying attention. What am I going to do, right?\n\nAnd I \u2013 one thought was, well, I\u2019ve got money, I can just kind of throw money out to people, you know \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and be that kind of philanthropist. It\u2019s like, nah, that \u2013 once your money is gone, that effect is gone. Well, I have 40+ years in tech, and I know that tech billionaires are kind of the top of the world right now. So, that means there\u2019s more money in tech. Why don\u2019t I help get more people into tech, right? \n\nSo then, that led to, well, there\u2019s lots of different models for that as well. I could invest. I could be an LP in someone else\u2019s thing, or whatever. There\u2019s lots of different ways of doing it. And I just came up with the models, like, well, what matches my skills and experience and network best? \n\nSo, I came up with the studio model, right, a venture studio. And the difference between a venture studio and a plain old VC is \u2013 or an accelerator is I tell people think of Motown, right? I\u2019m the Berry Gordy, right? I\u2019m going to find the talent; I\u2019m going to train the talent. I\u2019m going to find Aretha Franklin; I\u2019m going to find Michael Jackson. I\u2019m going to help show them how to dance, stage presence, give them the record contract, put them out in the network and help them build their thing, right? \n\nDo that with software. So, it\u2019s about creating software, creating a network, having a finance network, having resources as simple as, as soon as you start your business, you need a tax accountant, or else you\u2019re just going to fall behind on your taxes, and you\u2019re going to be out of business in a year. You need an admin, you know? (Laughter.) So, you need three or four programmers. You\u2019re not going to write the code yourself. \n\nAnd when you fail, you need someone to say, that\u2019s all right, let\u2019s do it again, right? And this is something that typically, black and women businesses don\u2019t have, right? They struggled to do it once. They get burned. They\u2019re working at McDonald\u2019s, or they\u2019re back to general population. They don\u2019t try again, because they\u2019ve got obligations. \n\nSo, the studio is intended to put a little cushion that they don\u2019t normally have in this society, such that they can have enough longevity to succeed, right? So, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of network building. I\u2019ve been writing tons of code, because the other thing that I\u2019m telling people is, okay, AI is the thing. Two years ago, I would have told you, go out and learn you some C sharp, you know, and Web development.\n\nNow it\u2019s like, no, no, no. First, you need to go play with ChatGPT. And if you\u2019re going to write any code at all, you\u2019re going to use copilot, right? And I\u2019m not just saying that because I\u2019m shilling for Microsoft. It\u2019s like, I do it myself, and it makes me 30% more productive, at least. So, I tell them that, and the software I\u2019m writing is about saying, how can I write code such that it\u2019s going to be more composable when I use AI to do it, right? \n\nSo, for example, there\u2019s a ZIP, the ZIP file format, right, compressed files. There\u2019s a library for that, and it has its quirks. I wrote one myself; I have my own ZIP decoder. And the interface is so simple that when I want to say, now compress that and stick it in the ZIP, it\u2019s one function, three parameters, done, right? \n\nClear licensing. I don\u2019t have to worry about all the licensing all over the place. And that\u2019s a difficulty when you start stitching with AI. It\u2019s like, well, wait a minute, where did that data come from? Where did that code come from? (Laughter.) Where did \u2013 do you have the right license for that chunk of code right there? \n\nSo, I\u2019m creating a substrate of code that\u2019s like, this is clearly licensed, right? And here\u2019s how you program leveraging AI, right? This is how we have to do it. This is how we\u2019re going to 10x our abilities, right, is by leveraging AI. You can\u2019t just go and lock yourself in a room and think you\u2019re going to hammer out some code, because by the time you\u2019re done, someone else who has got AI has already done it 10 times over. So, you better learn how to do it with AI, right? So, this is what I\u2019m currently engaged in.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: That is super cool. So, last question for you that I also ask everyone. And I know some of the things in the past that you might have answered to this question. But you\u2019re doing a ton of stuff, and I think you enjoy all of the, quote unquote, work that you\u2019re doing. But outside of work, what do you love to do?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWILLIAM ADAMS: I just bought a mountain bike a few weeks ago, and that\u2019s something I used to do. I used to actually race mountain bikes, cross country mountain bikes. I used to kayak; I used to do all sorts of physical things. And I would say a few years there of Microsoft plus new kids made a lot of that go down. But now the kids are \u2013 the youngest one is eight, the oldest one is 10. So, now it\u2019s back to mountain biking, and my son\u2019s kicking my butt, you know? (Laughter.) \n\nSo, I like mountain biking, I like tinkering. I\u2019ve got maybe 10 3D printers in my house, laser cutters, CNC routers.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: What\u2019s your favorite 3D printer right now?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWILLIAM ADAMS: The one we use the most is the Prusa. And we use both a regular sized Prusa and a mini. And we\u2019ll do them, oftentimes, both at the same time. Me and my son will print stuff out. Like, we made this big sword, and we\u2019ll do certain parts on the mini and certain parts on the regular sized one. So, yeah, that\u2019s the ones that I use the most right now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: I just got a Bambu Carbon X1 like a few months ago. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Oh, you\u2019re high end, man. (Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s not high end. Like, the high end when, like, over\u2026 yeah, here, behind me, like, I\u2019ve got a Markforged, which is a very nice printer. But, like, the Bambu Carbon X1 for, like, $1,000 printer is, like, really nice. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah. yeah, it\u2019s really funny, because I\u2019ve got enough printers here. And it\u2019s like, do not buy another printer. Do not buy another. Oh, Bambu Carbon, huh? (Laughter.) I mean, Christmas is coming.\u00a0(Laughter.)\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter.) Yeah, Christmas is, Christmas is coming. \n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: So yeah, tinkering, tinkering and gardening, so.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, it was, as always, fantastic to have an opportunity to chat with you. We miss you here at Microsoft, but we are extraordinarily happy and glad that you\u2019re doing what you do. And so, just keep up the good work, man.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah, all I can do is say, please like and subscribe, right? (Laughter.) Right? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yep. (Laughter.) Awesome. All right, thank you.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Okay, you\u2019re welcome. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right, okay. That was a fantastic conversation with William Adams. I love William. I think that he\u2019s amazing. I would love to have coffee with him some time. I could listen to the two of you talk about tech and about D&I stuff, and about, you know, your war stories from your time in tech for a really long time. So I loved that conversation. I wanted to kind of go back to some of the stuff that you were talking about towards the \u2013 the end of your conversation.\n\nWhen we were talking a little bit earlier Kevin, you mentioned how much you liked that William is really dedicated to giving back, and that really became evident in the conversation that you had. From your perspective, when you first learned about the Leap program, what about that stood out to you? Because I have to say, hearing him describe it, and even knowing as someone who used to work at Microsoft proper, knowing what that was, I didn\u2019t know the origin story. It clicked for me in a way that I was like, wow, this is brilliant. Why haven\u2019t more people done this? But I wanted to know, from your perspective, what did you think of the program? And what were some of the results that you saw \u2013 you know, once it was implemented?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So it was really funny when he was interviewing with me for this TA job inside of the Office of the CTO, like he had this thing that he wanted to bring with him. And I mean, it\u2019s funny actually hearing him talk about it, that he was like worried that I was going to say no, and rarely did I say no to things that William wanted to do. But this one in particular, we had, at LinkedIn, which was where I was before I came to Microsoft had some experience running a similar program. And it was exactly the same idea that if you wanted to find great engineers and great product people who were underrepresented in the places that you normally are recruiting from, like, you\u2019ve just got to figure out what you\u2019re going to change about your process. And like this idea of doing an apprenticeship program, like I think, is great. It has been extremely successful for both LinkedIn and Microsoft. And I don\u2019t understand why more people don\u2019t do it. \n\nLike in the worst case, what happens is you have an opportunity to work with amazing people who come in and get 16 weeks, or whatever the duration of the program is, of like real experience, and anybody who\u2019s ever done an internship or \u2013 you know, has gone from like one context where they get a whole bunch of experience that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have gotten that\u2019s professionally relevant, like, can tell you how valuable and informative those things are.\n\nAnd you get paid to do it. And at the end of it, like a super-high percentage of folks convert to full time jobs at the company, and those that don\u2019t, like have this super-interesting experience and a thing that goes on their resume that helps them find jobs elsewhere.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, no, and I think you hit on a really important thing there, even the people that don\u2019t get jobs from these programs, they have the experience, and I would go on to even say further, I think they have confidence.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Especially when we\u2019re talking about getting people who might not have come through the \"traditional way,\" people are plenty competent to do what they\u2019re doing, but they don\u2019t always have the confidence to do it. And if you can go through a program like this and have that experience, you have the confidence to go, \"Oh, you know what? I can do this; I can apply for this job. And I can go into that interview, and I can feel confident to, you know, get it and to ask for it.\" And so I think these sorts of programs are so important that I\u2019m so glad that \u2013 you know, William brought that to Microsoft, and that you embraced it in the Office of the CTO. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and just one more thing to say about that, I think the thing that we\u2019ve seen on this podcast with all the people that we\u2019ve chatted with, and it\u2019s certainly true, in my experience, I think it\u2019s true in yours, everybody has a very different path into the tech industry, with lots of twists and turns. And it\u2019s so sensitive to \u2013 you know, who you met, or what you got exposed to when or \u2013 you know, who you saw as a role model or like what piqued your curiosity at a moment when you were most receptive. \n\nAnd so we just can\u2019t expect everyone to, like, write your first program at 13. And like, you know, get into \u2013 you know, Governor\u2019s School for Science and Technology, and major in Computer Science at a top 10 school, and then go get a job at a top five \u2013 like that\u2019s not \u2013\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s such a narrow view of tech. And yeah, like, it\u2019s silly to, like think that that is the model.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I totally agree, we miss out on so many great people, if you\u2019re just focused on that narrow subset. Some of the most brilliant engineers, I know, some of the most technical people I know, are art majors have degrees in \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Art History, and that\u2019s amazing, right? And the fact that if you \u2013 again, if you were just to go based on a data-driven thing, and just to be focusing on a certain subset, you would miss all these people. One of the things that, again, you were talking about, towards the end of your conversation with William is talking about, you know, him wanting to start an engineering center in Africa. And he mentioned you have to go to where the talent is. And I think that that was an interesting and incisive thing for him to say, as well, because that\u2019s part of it too, right? It is you have to go to where the talent is. The talent is everywhere. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: It\u2019s not just one place. And we have to, I think open up our eyes to where that talent can be and look beyond just, you know, what has proven to be fruitful for us, maybe in the past.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: A hundred percent. And like, moreover, like the thing I would add is, like you have to go to where the talent will be. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah. Yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And if you sort of look at what the world is going to be like in the next 50 years, like we will be slowing down population growth in most of the industrialized world, and like the net-new population growth for the human race is going to be in Southeast Asia and in Africa. And so, the great young engineers of the future are going to be coming from Africa because, like, we just know capability distributions are the same no matter where you happen to be born. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Absolutely. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So it\u2019s just \u2013 again, it would be silly not to be investing there. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I completely agree, and I \u2013 I love \u2013 you know, I\u2019m glad that there are executives like you and leaders like William who are able to see that and then to make people \u2013 you know, make those decisions so that we can start to invest there and take advantage of that, right? I mean, honestly, that\u2019s a capitalistic response as much it is an altruistic one, because as you said, that\u2019s where the next generation of engineers are going to be. And I also really appreciate what William is doing with his venture studio, creating a place for people who don\u2019t have the traditional access to \u2013 you know, resources and networks of giving them, you know, those skills and again, that experience, that confidence to go out and try things and to fail, right? Like, because that\u2019s part of it too.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes. Like, honestly, I think that\u2019s probably more important even than access to \u2013 there are bunch of places online where you can go get technical skills. Like, if you\u2019re willing to spend the time there\u2019s capital is not scarce. You know, like, if you\u2019ve got a good idea. Like the thing, I think that can be really, really hard, especially if you are not sitting in the epicenter, or like one of these entrepreneurial areas, or you don\u2019t see anyone in your family or in your network doing these sorts of jobs, is just \u2013 is what you just said. It\u2019s the confidence. It is, like am I \u2013 am I good enough? Am I worthy? Like, can I be successful at doing these things?\n\nAnd, you know, and if you fail, which you will, like all of us fail, a lot, before we succeed, you know is there somebody there like William telling you that\u2019s okay. Like, \"What did you learn from that, like let\u2019s get back up and go at it again.\" Like, I \u2013 honestly, that \u2013 that, it\u2019s unbelievably valuable, that thing that he\u2019s doing.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I totally agree. I\u2019m really glad that we have people like him who have given us so much, not just, you know, technologically, and I will forgive him for some of the XML horror that I\u2019ve dealt with. I will forgive him for that because of all the good work you\u2019ve done. And I\u2019m kidding, I also thank him for XML, even if the XML era made me want to, you know, rip my skin off, but I\u2019m super, super, super grateful for that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I\u2019m most grateful for XML HTTP requests.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, they gave us the modern web. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: You\u2019re absolutely right, and it was funny because when he mentioned XML, I was like, \"Oh, I went on a rant the other week about how much I hate XML.\" And he said that, and I was like, \"You know what? Yes. Yes.\"\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: You\u2019ve got to give him that.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I was like, \"Okay, you know what?\" Correct, correct, I will bow down.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right, well, that is going to do it for us today.
