{"episode": "Ep-55 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Mira Murati", "text": "MIRA MURATI: We\u2019re working on something that will change everything. Will change the way that we work, the way that we interact with each other, and the way that we think and everything, really, all aspects of life.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we\u2019re going to get behind the tech. We\u2019ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what\u2019s happening today. Stick around.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Today we have a super exciting guest with us, Mira Murati. I've had the pleasure of working very closely with Mira and her team at OpenAI for the last several years. And even though I've had all of these opportunities to interact with her, it was so interesting to hear more about her story, like how she grew up, how she first became interested in mathematics and then physics and science and where this intense curiosity that she had from childhood eventually led her. And I think there were just some amazing nuggets in our conversation. Can't wait to dive right in. So let's get at it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Mira Murati is the CTO of OpenAI. She worked as an engineer and product manager, most notably helping to develop the Tesla Model X. She joined OpenAI in 2018 as the VP of applied AI and partnerships and has since been promoted to CTO. During that time, she\u2019s helped bring AI products like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and GPT-4 public and has partnered closely with our team at Microsoft to integrate their technology into our products. It is so awesome to have you on the show today, Mira. Thank you so much for joining us. \n\nMIRA MURATI: Thank you, Kevin. Excited to be here. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes, so I actually -- I\u2019m going to learn a lot about you today that I don\u2019t know, which I\u2019m super stoked about. I would love to understand how you got interested in science and technology in the first place. \n\nMIRA MURATI: It started with math. When I was a kid, I just gravitated toward math. I would do problem sets all the time and then eventually did Olympiads and I loved doing that. It was such a passion. \n\nI grew up in Albania. It\u2019s a small country in Europe. This was during the transition from totalitarian communism to liberal capitalism. When I was two, the dictatorship regime fell. It was sort of anarchy overnight. \n\nOne thing that people misunderstand about the communist regimes is that when everything is equal, there is this really fierce competition for knowledge, and education is everything. That\u2019s the setting that I grew up in. I was always very hungry for knowledge and the pursuit of knowledge. \n\nIn a place where there is this constant regime change and everything is uncertain, I gravitated more towards the truth in science something that felt steady and you could get to the bottom of. Also, the sources of history books or other books are questionable, history kept changing. So, I think maybe just intuitive and natural gravitation towards sciences and math was amplified by the circumstances in which I grew up in. \n\nFrom a very young age, I was super interested in math and physics and continued to pursue them until university. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Were your parents mathematicians or scientists? \n\nMIRA MURATI: No, not really. They actually taught literature. It was an organic interest towards math and science. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Coming from the west, one of the things that I -- I\u2019m a little bit older -- or a lot older than you, I think. One of the things that struck me growing up where I also was interested in math and science and programming fairly early on was that there was this competitive nature between the liberal democracies of the west and some of the Russian coalition that we -- knowledge, itself, particularly science and mathematics and technical knowledge were like one of these things that were highly valued both here and there at the time because it was a way to just sort of compete in whatever contest it was that we were playing. I don\u2019t know whether it felt like that in Albania or not. \n\nMIRA MURATI: Yeah. Very much like that. I just love doing all these Olympiads, whether it was chemistry, biology, or math. When you\u2019re a kid, you don\u2019t really think about that. It was just a passion. But looking back, I can sort of see the circumstances and when there -- also just, you know, keep in mind that there wasn\u2019t access to a lot of tools or entertainment, and so a little bit was just out of boredom as well. \n\nBoredom, actually, I think is a very powerful motivator to go explore and really pursue frontiers of anything. In the first years of my childhood, Albania was incredibly isolated, like North Korea is today. And so, there wasn\u2019t much inflow of entertainment or anything really besides books. Books were this entire universe. And, you know, it\u2019s -- back then, I just searched everything in books. Now, we\u2019ve got all these powerful tools in our fingertips and can do anything, really. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, what you just said that boredom is a very useful thing. I could not more strongly agree with. It\u2019s really interesting that we seem to, as a society, have decided that boredom is bad and is a thing to minimize. It\u2019s one of the things that I struggle with my own children. I\u2019ve got a 12- and a 14-year-old. And they don\u2019t have the same capacity to be bored as I did when I was a child. \n\nI didn\u2019t grow up in Albania, like I\u2019m sure like it\u2019s probably unfair to even make this comparison, but you know, like, I grew up in rural central Virginia. We had three television channels and, you know, like, I was bored a lot and, like, most of my life was to get, you know, in books. \n\nIt was a very useful thing to, you know, I got focused very quickly on things that were substantive.\n\nMIRA MURATI: Yes, exactly that. Like, exercising that ability to stay focused on something and, you know, reflect on information or distilling this information further. And a lot of math is like that, you just need to sit with the problem forever and it kind of exercises that muscle and faith so that if you sit with it, you\u2019ll discover something. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, for sure. I mean, I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve even had hard math problems that I worked on in the past where I was so obsessed with them that I would dream about them. Sometimes I would even wake up and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, finally,\u201d like, I\u2019ve got the -- I got the proof for this theorem that I just dreamt. \n\nMIRA MURATI: Exactly. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So I\u2019m interested to hear how, you know, that interest that you had, you know, which sounds like it was sort of innate or, you know, in the air and cultural just from the circumstances of how you grew up. But, like, how did it get nurtured? Like, some of this stuff is hard. And so, did you have mentors or teachers or were the schools good? Like, how did you -- or maybe, like, I should ask a different way. So, like, at some point, whenever you are trying to do something substantive, like things get hard enough where you get stuck, so how did you get yourself unstuck? \n\nMIRA MURATI: Yeah, for me, my teachers when I was growing up, they were extremely supportive. It was sort of unusual circumstances because I think today maybe less of that would be available, but back then, I don\u2019t know, maybe they saw something in me and they really wanted to help me pursue my interests and, you know, often in class I\u2019d do completely different problem sets because I was bored with the usual curriculum. And I\u2019d still sit there with everyone, but they were very supportive of me doing something entirely different. \n\nAnd I was also lucky that my sister is a year and a half older than me. And so, when I\u2019d get bored with my stuff, I would go and look into her books. And then when I\u2019d do her books, then I\u2019d find other books and my teachers were very helpful with that. I think that was probably the most helpful thing. Like, I always knew there was something else. There was more to pursue. There was more to learn. \n\nAnd then when I was 16, I was fortunate to get a scholarship to study abroad in Vancouver in Canada, where I did my last two years of high school. And that was a big opportunity, you know, to get outside of Albania and study in an international school with people from many different countries. That was a great opportunity for me. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, where did computers enter the picture for you? \n\nMIRA MURATI: It was quite late, I would say. Maybe when I was a teenager in Albania and, you know, internet was slow, but I already thought about intelligence a lot. More through math and solving problems and just like the theory of how the world works and trying to explain a lot of things through math or physics even. \n\nBut I was always interested in how the brain works and intelligence, more theoretically and at abstract levels. But I\u2019d say that, you know, the art of sort of what I pursued was more in the theme of trying to apply my knowledge and try to apply technology to really hard problems that in some way makes our lives better. \n\nAnd when I was in college, I was studying engineering because I felt this was the best way to apply my knowledge to actually solving real problems in the world. And when I was studying engineering, I was very interested in pursuing ways to bring sustainable transport to the world and also just sustainable energy in general. \n\nAnd so, my senior project, actually, was building this hybrid race car. It was fun, but also we wanted to do something that felt really hard, and so instead of batteries, we used supercapacitors and you know, really trying to push what was possible. And, obviously, that was not something that you could build in production, but it was pushing science and seeing what\u2019s possible. \n\nAnd that\u2019s why, thereafter, I -- you know, I went to work at Tesla and I was really passionate about sustainable energy and sort of doing my part in bringing sustainable transport to the world. That was a very exciting time about 10 years ago at Tesla. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s awesome. So, what type of engineering did you study? Were you an electrical engineer? Mechanical engineer? Something different? \n\nMIRA MURATI: Yes. I studied mechanical engineering. A lot of hands-on stuff -- software, but also hands-on. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And what was your favorite thing about, I mean, because you\u2019re doing something very different now, like mechanical engineering is quite a bit different than, like, running a software engineering team. And, like, I love mechanical engineering. It\u2019s funny enough, like I do -- like, I built my entire career on software engineering, but like, most of what I do in my free time is mechanical engineering and mechanical design. \n\nSo, I -- like, what attracted you to that in the first place, other than, you know the sort of the sustainable, like, that it was a lever on to doing something in sustainable energy and, like, how -- how was that different than what you do now? \n\nMIRA MURATI: Yes. I think back then I probably saw it more as a more tangible way to change things. And it just felt -- it didn\u2019t feel abstract. It felt very, you know, just very tangible. You make a change and you see it and you see how it affects reality. And I was always sort of a thinker. I would explore different things. \n\nIt was hard. Mechanical engineering is hard, but it\u2019s also very -- very fulfilling and there was always a software component. So, like in a hybrid car, you\u2019ve got the entire system and it\u2019s not just the mechanical engineering part, there\u2019s always a software component, the electrical engineering component. So, it\u2019s kind of a little bit of everything and I always was attracted to sort of like complex systems. \n\nAnd, you know, when I was at Tesla, I got more and more interested in Auto Pilot and the promise of it and also what we could do with AI and computer vision to completely change the way that we, you know, travel. And so, that got more and more interested in AI and what it could do in the world, what sort of changes it could bring. \n\nAnd from there, one of the problems, I didn\u2019t necessarily want to become a car person. I always had this curiosity for different things. And I was very curious about how AI would affect the way that we interact with machines and how we interact with information in general. So, at the time, I got really interested in spatial computing and just interacting with information and complex concepts in a completely different way that we interact even today, really, with a keyboard and a mouse, which is just so limited. \n\nAnd so, I thought that AI and computer vision would help us really change this interface of interacting with information and I imagined, you know, virtual reality or augmented reality where you can almost touch molecules or you can get a sense for chaos theory or gravitational waves, and that is such an intuitive understanding of concepts -- complex concepts, versus, you know, when you read it on a page. \n\nIt's almost like as intuitive as grabbing a ball and, you know, getting a sense of projectile motion, even if you don\u2019t know the laws of physics. And so, I thought, wow, this can really change the way that we learn and the way we absorb the world. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That feels so true to me. I mean, I think one of the things that I really appreciate about the modern world that we live in right now is you have things like YouTube where if you are trying to understand a thing, there\u2019s so many people trying to explain that thing in so many different ways that if you are determined enough, you can find someone explaining the thing in exactly the right way for your particular brain to understand it quickly. \n\nMIRA MURATI: Exactly. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And that was always my struggle. Like I could learn very quickly, but like, I don\u2019t think I learn exactly the same way that other people learn. And if, like, I can get the right conceptual hook on something, then I\u2019ve got it and, like, I can even understand, like, the things that, like, before I got the hook were too complicated. \n\nIt\u2019s one of the things, actually, that really excites me about what it is that, you know, you all are doing at OpenAI with these agents, because you can -- the agent, if you are trying to get it to explain something to you, is infinitely patient and it\u2019s sort of adaptable. \n\nLike, it will explain things to you, like, in the way that you need it to explain things if you\u2019re willing to, like, have a conversation and tell it, like, what it is that you need. That feels very powerful to me. \n\nMIRA MURATI: I completely agree. Yeah, it\u2019s one of the things that I\u2019m most excited about with these large language models and just generally deploying the AI systems that we\u2019re building in the real world.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, so let\u2019s go back for a minute before we get onto all the exciting AI stuff, which I\u2019m sure is what everyone wants to hear us talk about. Like, I want to hear a little bit about Tesla. So, like, what was it like working there? And, like, you had a pretty big responsibility there, like, at the end, where you were the head product manager for the Model X, which is, like, one of the most amazing, innovative vehicles that anyone\u2019s ever created. So, for you not thinking of yourself as a car person, like, you helped make one of the most disruptive cars that the world has seen, like, maybe in the past 40-50 years. So, like, tell us a little bit about that. \n\nMIRA MURATI: Tesla was an incredible place. And in some ways, actually, I find it quite similar to OpenAI now, where you have -- obviously, it was much bigger and working on something very different, but this high density of very talented smart people that are just so passionate about what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s almost, you know, it\u2019s almost like a spiritual pursuit. Everyone believed so hard in what they were doing and that being the most important thing. \n\nAnd that is just so powerful when you\u2019re working on really hard problems and in the case of Tesla, it\u2019s transforming an entire industry versus creating many new ones as well as transforming them. \n\nAnd, you know, it was incredibly hard, but also just invigorating and sort of fun and I learned so much in a short amount of time. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal, you know, to build a car from zero to one, you know, in just three or four years. It\u2019s a very short time. These things usually have this, like, very long life cycle or timelines in terms of design and prototyping and then production and so on. \n\nAnd, you know, one of the things that I learned at Tesla was that there\u2019s always some different way, even if it seems impossible, there is always a way. There is always a different way. And, you know, in product in general, there\u2019s kind of two ways of building product, where you have the really, really polished stuff. Then, this way of kind of hacking and iterating and, you know, getting a lot of feedback from your user base and customers, and just iterating quickly on that. \n\nTesla, I would say, was in between, kind of doing both.  And that was incredible. I mean, just the first time operating like that in an industry that is so established. And so I learned a lot, especially from, you know, just the power of being creative and thinking originally and just really changing everything and questioning what you know and questioning why things are done a certain way. And I also just -- that was the place where I started getting really interested into the power of AI and how it would change everything that we do. \n\nSo, in a sense, it was, you know, in my career, it was the place that really catalyzed my interest in working in AI. And then, of course, after working in VR and AR, I just thought, okay, intelligence is really the fundamental property of how the world is going to change. Then, I got more and more interested in just the application side of it, but really understanding what general intelligence meant and how we could build it and how we make things go well for the world, if we do build it. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Before we move on to AI, like, what\u2019s a -- if you can share, like, an interesting technical problem or, like, technical thing that you learned on the Model X, you know, like something that was tricky or interesting or different. \n\nMIRA MURATI: So many things. So many things I could talk about the falcon doors, but I feel like that could be problematic. (Laughter.) That\u2019s probably like the most interesting one. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, maybe at a high level we can sort of talk about that. So, like, that is an interesting design choice to make. So, obviously, a brand-new thing and, like, you know, as an engineer, like, I don\u2019t know the details of the implementation, but like, I can imagine how difficult it was to make that feature of the car work technically. Did you all have a sense for -- and I\u2019m sure, like, there are just dozens of these things on a car where, like, you know, some designer has this idea that I want to do this thing, and then some engineer has to go decide or figure out, like, how to make the thing work. Like, in -- just in general, like, how do you balance those two things? \n\nMIRA MURATI: Yeah. There are a lot of things about the Model X that felt, you know, just really pushing the envelope and just that had never been done before or especially in that kind of car. \n\nAnd so, you know, like the doors were a feature like that or the HVAC system, the HEPA filter, and it always required kind of bringing together the whole team -- all the parts that would be working together -- so design, engineering, manufacturing, you know, the software side of the team to -- or maybe if it was relevant, you know, the electrical engineers and really bringing together all the pieces, so you could kind of design it together versus hand it off and then go back and forth. Or, like, you know, design something that could not be manufactured. \n\nSo, that was very powerful, working with teams that had different backgrounds, domain expertise, figuring out how to design something that has never been done before, adopting new ideas, very quickly kind of killing old ideas and moving on to the next one and just, like, figuring out the right problem to work on at the right time. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, I think that is, like, an incredibly important thing. This idea of, like, you do your work and then throw it over the wall to, like, the next, you know, person or team and the change that has to go do the next thing is, you know, there\u2019s a certain sort of efficiency that you can get from doing things that way, but if you\u2019re trying to make something brand new, it\u2019s very difficult to, like, have these sort of waterfall processes like that. \n\nI mean, there are so many jokes about, you know, like one of the things I was going to ask you about as a mechanical engineer is, like, hey, did you spend any time in the machine shop? Because, like, there\u2019s this tension between -- \n\nMIRA MURATI: Yes, plenty. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: -- mechanical engineers and machinists. It\u2019s like, oh, you like gave me this print and, like, there\u2019s no way to make it. Or, you know, there\u2019s the tension in software engineering between the product managers and the engineers. Like, you know, the product manager says, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go do this thing,\u201d and the engineers are like, \u201cOh, are you crazy?\u201d And so, like, it usually works better when everybody is, like, in the conversation, so it\u2019s super interesting to hear you say that\u2019s how you all did your work. \n\nMIRA MURATI: Yeah, totally. And, yeah it\u2019s funny that you mention it because, I -- as a mechanical engineer, I was often machining my own parts just to understand sort of the constraint, limitations, and also just the challenges of doing it. \n\nAnd it was very similar at Tesla, where the, you know, design engineers were often on the floor, you know, fitting, testing the parts, and just working very closely with manufacturing engineers. And I think that, like you said, it\u2019s key to innovating at scale past a certain size of the company. It\u2019s difficult to innovate if you\u2019re just throwing things over the wall and, you know, like bureaucracy can kick in or processes and, you know, but as they grow, companies can lose their vision and sort of stop pursuing new ideas. \n\nBut, you know, if you kind of cut through that and minimize sort of the layers of processes and things or hoops that you have to jump through to get something done or bring some new idea, then I think it\u2019s much easier. So that was something actually quite critical, looking back, that I learned working at Tesla. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I was listening a long while ago to an interview that, like, Elon was doing where he was describing this thing that was happening not with the Model X, but like another one of the automobiles where they were having a really challenging time getting something manufactured. And as soon as he started, like, asking the right questions, it turned out that, like, the problem wasn\u2019t solving the problem of like how to make this particular thing, like, you know, actually manufacturable. It was like, why did this thing exist at all? Like, it was just completely unnecessary that it got designed the way that it got designed. \n\nAnd, like, the real fix wasn\u2019t to, like, go solve the nasty, hard problem, because the thing, itself, was a little bit arbitrary and it\u2019s, like, change the initial conditions and then the problem gets easier to solve. \n\nAnd so I think that\u2019s -- it\u2019s one of the things I admire a lot about Elon is, like, this first principles thinking of always, like, being able to sort of step back and, you know, ask the right questions about why are we doing a thing the way that we\u2019re doing it? And, like, what is necessary and what is not? \n\nMIRA MURATI: Yes. I think that\u2019s incredibly important -- stepping back and not -- I mean, having the ability to be immersed in details and dig deep when you need to, but also stepping back and asking the right questions and having sort of this high degree of adaptability in the team, and tolerance for ambiguity. Because, you know, especially when people are extremely experienced, they have a certain way of doing things. And so you kind of need to be adaptable and also, you know, kind of believe and disbelieve things at the same time. \n\nAnd that\u2019s -- those are hard -- qualities and traits to sort of sit together. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and then there\u2019s just something about big organizations, like, organizations should only be big if the nature of the problem that they\u2019re solving for their stakeholders requires you to be big. Because bigness is almost like a flavor of entropy that forces some of this stuff to happen where, like, you know -- just because of the complexity of the whole, like, no one has all of the details in their head. And so, like, you can find yourself -- \n\nMIRA MURATI: Of course. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: -- trapped in, like, you know, do -- just feverishly working as hard as you can on the details of something. And if you could pull all the way back, you would just find that the thing that you\u2019re working so hard on is like completely unnecessary. You know, and so it\u2019s one of the great things about, like, the size that OpenAI is at right now is, like, you sort of still institutionally, like, you know, and the complexity of things. You can -- you have less of that weird, you know, entropy that happens to big organizations. \n\nAnd so, you know, the thing that I found is you just have to fight against it super hard, because if you -- if you\u2019re not pushing back against this thing, you\u2019re just letting people entirely optimize for the narrow thing, like it just metastasizes in confusion, basically, and like people optimizing for the wrong thing. \n\nMIRA MURATI: Yeah, and certain momentum just carries on. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So, let\u2019s -- let\u2019s talk about AI. Like, how -- like, let\u2019s sort of start with, like, how did you make the transition from Tesla to OpenAI? Because you were in very early. From the beginning, like, it wasn\u2019t obvious at the start that -- like, not obvious at all -- \n\nMIRA MURATI: Not at all. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: -- that you were going to get to where you\u2019re at now. So, like, what made you take the leap? \n\nMIRA MURATI: Yeah. So, after I was -- after I worked in VR and AR and was really intent on defining the new interface for spatial computing, back then, it was a bit early -- I think too early for VR and AR, but I -- at that time, I got really interested in how AI can help us just redefine the way that we interact with the world and we absorb information and the things that we produce and how it affects creativity. \n\nAnd so, just you know, this entire concept of amplifying our intelligence and what that means. And so, you know, I was really interested in learning more and seeing where this can go, this idea of pushing intelligence as a fundamental property that can have this very broad, universal impact. And, you know, at the time, I wasn\u2019t sure whether -- what the chances of that are to go all the way to artificial general intelligence. \n\nBut I was just very interested in figuring out how far we could pursue it, and it really seemed like maybe the last thing that we\u2019d ever work on, and it seemed like the most important thing that I could work on. And it was important to me to -- to work on it at a place that cared about making sure that it goes well for the world. \n\nAnd so, I joined OpenAI when it was a nonprofit. And, you know, the mission of the company was then -- and still is -- to make sure that building AGI goes well for everyone in the world and people can benefit from what it will bring. Obviously, since then, for practical reasons, we\u2019ve evolved the structure of the company to have it be a limited partnership with a capped profit, so it still maintains the same mission that the nonprofit oversees the mission of the company. \n\nBut you know, I just sort of pursued my curiosity and what felt like the most important thing to me at the time. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, which I -- like, honestly, I think is super good career advice for anyone, being able to make choices about what you do, where you believe the thing that you\u2019re working on is, like, the most important thing you can make a contribution to I think is -- you know, a thing people don\u2019t think deliberately enough about. \n\nMIRA MURATI: I think it\u2019s so important because when you\u2019re working on really hard things, it\u2019s that -- that passion, that innate curiosity is the thing that can pull you through. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, a hundred percent, I mean, like, just to -- I -- really glad you said that because I -- I say this to people all the time, it\u2019s -- if you\u2019re working on a really hard problem with a bunch of really smart, highly motivated people, it\u2019s hard. Like, most days, you\u2019re failing. \n\nMIRA MURATI: Exactly. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, you go in and you\u2019re trying something and it doesn\u2019t work and you\u2019re frustrated with yourself and you\u2019re frustrated with the people around you. \n\nAnd there are only a very small number of things that you can have that will help you do that day after day after day until you\u2019ve actually solved the problem and you, like, get something that matters. And if you quit before you solve the problem, then you haven\u2019t solved the problem. Like, you\u2019ve got nothing but this accumulated frustration that you\u2019ve had. \n\nAnd like, you know, and I think one of the very few things that you can have that will get you through is, like, you have to believe that it\u2019s the most important thing that you could be doing, you have to believe that it matters. Like, money is not enough, you know, your mom wanting you to do it isn\u2019t enough -- like, you know, looking good on your resume isn\u2019t enough. Like, you have to deeply, deeply believe that it\u2019s the most important thing you could be doing. \n\nMIRA MURATI: Yeah, exactly. And it\u2019s hard to find that faith and belief and you almost have to experiment a bit through -- I mean, your entire life sometimes to just really find what that is, what is the thing that really brings you this satisfaction? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, at some point, you also have to figure out, like, what your mechanism is for dealing with that frustration of, like, friction and failure, you know, because, you know, it\u2019s tough, I mean, I\u2019m sure this is for everything that you\u2019ve done because you seem to have repeatedly chosen to do very hard things. \n\nLike, I know for me, like, I repeatedly choose to, like, do -- I mean, it\u2019s almost like, you know, the most important thing is almost always, like, the hardest thing you could choose to do. And so, you know, just being able to, like, sustain that over time is -- because at some point, too, you also you know, like, you probably had enough success from your career at Tesla where you could have chosen, like, you know, just from a success perspective to not do the hardest thing. You could be like, all right, well, I could go do something slightly easier than, like, try to make an AGI, like, in a nonprofit, right? That\u2019s -- that sounds impossibly hard. (Laughter.) \n\nMIRA MURATI: If -- when you put it like that, yes. (Laughter.) Yes. In fact, yeah. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: One of the things that I think has helped OpenAI be very successful is you have really excellent people -- folks who are, you know, in their particular domain, whether it\u2019s, you know, figuring out how to, like, wring numeric performance out of a GPU. \n\nOr if it\u2019s someone who understands how to do safety and alignment work. Or whether it\u2019s someone who understands, like, how to architect a deep neural network -- someone who understands distributed systems. So you have, like, just people who are at the very top of their game in each one of those areas. \n\nAnd you also have this mission -- you know, like, how do you -- how do you go solve this incredibly complicated problem that, you know, not just OpenAI but, like, humanity has been, you know, sort of thinking about for thousands of years. And, like, how do you make that a reality? And, like, how do you do it in a way where, you know, it creates massive benefits for humanity? \n\nSo, but you\u2019ve got this third thing that\u2019s interesting, which is a way to keep people focused on moving forward and progress. So, like, you could have the mission and you could have all of these smart people, but like, they could be running in a thousand different directions and, like, their work could not be accruing to, like, a thing that\u2019s making progress. \n\nAnd I think that\u2019s sort of the extraordinary third thing that you all have been able to do. And I don\u2019t know -- don\u2019t know whether you share that same perspective or, you know, like, it -- you know, I\u2019m just sort of curious on your take of, like, what that missing element is \u2018cause, like, lots of labs out there with really smart people spending a lot of money and, you know, they\u2019ve got an interesting intellectual mission and they still haven\u2019t been able to make the sort of progress that you all have made. \n\nMIRA MURATI: It\u2019s incredibly hard. Like you said, you know, you can have these incredibly talented people and high density of them and they\u2019re innately curious and they\u2019re, you know, forever in pursuit of discovery and something new. But you need to -- that needs to compound. You need to have all the smart people working together on kind of similar same bets. \n\nAnd, you know, it\u2019s -- you want to motivate people. You don\u2019t hire smart people, tell them what to do, and -- but you -- you want them to be motivated and aligned enough to kind of work on similar or the same things. \n\nAnd at OpenAI, I think one of the most important things that we managed to do well was take a bet or take a couple of bets on the things that we believed the most and get alignment on those very early on. And even, you know at the stage of recruiting people, actually, and bringing them in that\u2019s most important and making sure they\u2019re really aligned on those things. \n\nAnd it\u2019s hard to say no, especially when there is so much opportunity.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes. \n\nMIRA MURATI: It could be working on all these different ideas. It\u2019s incredibly hard to say no. And so, and you doubt yourself. And you know, it might take a while for -- for these bets to pan out, you know, like the scaling laws and focusing on one large model, a ton of data, which now it\u2019s obvious, but back then, not so much. And getting alignment on that is incredibly hard. \n\nBut I think it\u2019s -- goes back to this idea of, like, figuring out how you work on the right problem at the right time and having faith on that. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I want to double-click on this notion of it\u2019s hard to say no. It\u2019s incredibly hard to say no, because like the thing that you\u2019re faced with as CTO of OpenAI -- and, like, I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve had a lot of this over the past two decades -- is you -- you will have the smartest people in the world coming to you with very good ideas -- ideas that you think are interesting and, like, you\u2019re a curious person and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s amazing. Like, I -- I love this.\u201d \n\nAnd then you know that that idea is not on the path that you\u2019re pursuing and it might not be the next most important thing to go work on if you\u2019re choosing the next most important thing. And just saying no -- and like you\u2019re also a good person and, like, you know, the people you work with are good people and like you don\u2019t want to disappoint them and you don\u2019t want them to be sad. \n\nAnd so it\u2019s a real art form, I think. It\u2019s, like, having the confidence and the courage to say no, yourself, when you also have your own uncertainties, like, am I wrong? Like, am I making the right call? And then being able to, like, deliver the no where it\u2019s not a no, it\u2019s sort of a no, but. It\u2019s no, you know, but, like, here\u2019s this other thing that, you know, like, I -- I think if you do that, it will be even more interesting and, you know, create more impact. It\u2019s hard. \n\nMIRA MURATI: Exactly. It is extremely hard. And with that, together with that goes this, you know, building the muscle as an organization to sort of learn new things quickly or learn what\u2019s not going to work very quickly and adopt what\u2019s going to work very quickly and kill the old ideas quickly. It is hard to kill things that are already, you know, maybe working, but they\u2019re not working as well as something new that you could be doing. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, well, look, I think -- you know, that\u2019s another thing that you all do really well. And it\u2019s -- and it\u2019s very, very, very important is choosing when to stop doing things. \n\nSo, you know, like, for instance, you all had, like, an incredibly great demo a handful of years ago of a robotic hand that could single-hand solve a Rubik\u2019s cube. And, like, it was, you know, a demo that was, you know, trying to get a reinforcement learning system to learn a robotic, kinematic model. And so, like, it\u2019s technically interesting work. It\u2019s a super-cool demo, but like, you all decided, like, this isn\u2019t on the path so, like, we\u2019re going to stop working on this. \n\nMIRA MURATI: Right. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And, like, that\u2019s a hard decision -- \n\nMIRA MURATI: Yeah, exactly. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: -- because that was a lot of work for someone. It was, like, their favorite thing in the world. You know, it\u2019s like, you know, people may quit, like, because, you know, you stop doing this thing, and that\u2019s the thing they wanted to work on, so they\u2019re going to go find you know some other place to go work on it. But -- but it\u2019s important, like, really important. \n\nMIRA MURATI: Yeah, exactly. It was, you know, at the time, it was a very big bet that the company was making. And, you know, we had that and DOTA and we sort of had this inflection point that, okay, what are we trying to learn? How does this fit in on our path to AGI? And is there a better way? And so, we are choosing to stop working on it. There is a better way. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, you said a lot of, like, very important, profound things. Like, you just said something that I think is also very important is, like, what are we trying to learn? Like, if more people ask that question deliberately, like, we would have a much better world and people would have more success. \n\nBut, like, I mean, that is, in essence, I think, you know, one of the things that you all -- that you all have always had pretty good focus on. It\u2019s like you\u2019re not doing activity for the sake of activity or, like, doing activity for the sake of, like, proving that you\u2019re smart. \n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t have to be AI. It could be product design or it could be, you know, like, parenting or whatever. Like, just -- \n\nMIRA MURATI: It\u2019s true. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: -- trying, you know, like, what are you trying to learn, you know, through this thing that you\u2019re doing? \n\nMIRA MURATI: Yeah. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about -- I mean, you all have had an unbelievable -- like, total run, but like in particular, the past year or even the past six months have been I think shocking to a bunch of folks. \n\nI\u2019ve been following what you all have been doing for a while. \n\nMIRA MURATI: Of course. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, you know, like, you know, what happened in the past six months wasn\u2019t so -- I mean, it was, like, surprising to me, but not quite as shocking to folks who, you know, sort of saw nothing, nothing, nothing and then all of a sudden like ChatGPT emerges and it, like, becomes the most interesting thing in the world. \n\nTalk a little bit about that journey, because you know, I think ChatGPT is just one point on, like, a long set of efforts that you all have been working on. And, like, it\u2019s not even the last thing, right? So, like, that\u2019s the other thing that people probably aren\u2019t internalizing that, you know, it is a point on a curve and, like, you know, more things are coming. So, like, how have you all thought about that, like, in the context of how the public is reacting? \n\nMIRA MURATI: You know, the first time that we thought about deploying this models that were just in research territory was kind of this insane idea. It wasn\u2019t normal back then to go deploy a large language model in the real world. And, you know, what is the business case? What is it actually going to do for people? What problems is it going to solve? Like, we didn\u2019t really have those answers. \n\nBut we thought, you know, if we make it accessible in such a way that it\u2019s easy to use and it is cheap to use, it is highly optimized, you don\u2019t need a lot of -- you don\u2019t need to know all the bells and whistles of machine learning and just accessible, then maybe people\u2019s creativity would just bring to life, you know, new products and solutions and we\u2019d see how this technology could help us in the real world. \n\nAnd, of course, we had a hypothesis, but really it was just putting GPT-3 in the API the first time that we saw people interact with these large language models and the technology that we were building and that for so many years we\u2019d just been building in the lab without, you know, this real-world contact and feedback from people out there. \n\nSo, that was the first time. It was sort of this leap of faith that it was going to teach us something, we were going to learn something from it. And, hopefully, we could feed it back into the technology. We could bring back that knowledge, that feedback, and figure out how to use it to make the technology better, more reliable, more aligned, safer, more robust when it eventually gets deployed in the real world. \n\nAnd, you know, I always believe that you can\u2019t just build this powerful technology in the lab with no contact with reality and hope that somehow it\u2019s going to go well and that it\u2019s going to be safe and beneficial for all. And, somehow, you do need to figure out how to bring society along both in gathering that feedback and insight, but also in adjusting society to this change. \n\nAnd the best way to do that is for people to actually interact with the technology and see for themselves, instead of, you know, telling them or just sharing scientific papers. So that was very important. And it took us, then, a couple of years to get to the point where we were not just releasing improvements to the model through the API, but in fact, the first interface that was more consumer facing that we played around with was DALL-E. DALL-E Labs, where people could just input a prompt in natural language and then you\u2019d see these beautiful, original, amazing images come up. \n\nAnd then, you know, really for research reasons, we were experimenting with this interface of dialogue where you go back and forth with the model and ChatGPT and dialogue is such a powerful tool, you know, the idea of Socratic dialogue and how -- how people learn, you can sort of correct one another and/or ask questions, get really to deeper truth. \n\nAnd so, we thought, you know, if we put this out there, even with the existing models, we will learn a lot. We will get a lot of feedback and we can use this feedback to actually make our upcoming model that at the time was GPT-4 safer and more aligned. \n\nSo, that was kind of the motivation. And, of course, as we saw, you know, in just a few days, it became super popular and people just loved interacting with this AI system. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: One of the reasons why just me personally, I\u2019ve been excited about the work that you all are doing is like this notion that you want to really allow a lot of people -- a lot of non-expert people to be able to play around with the technology and to imagine how they can use it for things that they think are important is super important to me. \n\nAnd, you know, maybe a little bit is -- of the same is true for you, but like, I grew up not in, like, one of the coastal innovation centers, where things like these AI systems get created. I, like you, did not have, like, computer scientist or engineer parents. \n\nThe problems that people have in rural central Virginia, and I\u2019m guessing the problems that people have in Albania, like, you know, some of them are common across the board, but some of them are like very different. And, like, some of them, like, you can\u2019t even imagine, like, if your entire world view is, like, you know, I went to Stanford, I you know, got a job at, like, one of the biggest technology companies in the world and, you know, like I\u2019m building this technology and, like, I -- you know, I have to imagine all of its possible uses. Like, you just can\u2019t even imagine what life is like for, you know someone.\n\nMIRA MURATI: Of course not. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: from Albania or rural Virginia. And so, I think it\u2019s really unbelievably important to, like, have these things be platforms that aren\u2019t, you know, aren\u2019t just getting built in a lab where all the consequential decisions get made without any contact with the real world. \n\nMIRA MURATI: Exactly. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And that doesn\u2019t mean that have to -- I mean, and this is the last thing I want to, you know, chat about before we run out of time, but like, it, you know, it creates this very, very hard problem of, like, how you do responsible AI, because like, you get this big benefit of lots of people participating, but then you get this big bucket of things that you have to go solve at the same time to make sure that you know, it\u2019s not creating a whole bunch of harm. \n\nSo, like, you know, talk a little bit about how you all think about that. \n\nMIRA MURATI: Yeah. That\u2019s well put. It\u2019s all about these trade-offs and minimizing. You can't have zero risk, for really minimizing those harms. And actually, really being able to respond quickly and iterate quickly on being able to maybe make changes to the models, themselves, or introduce tools or policies, basically, to contain those harms. \n\nAnd that\u2019s very difficult because, often, we\u2019re kind of doing all of this in the public eye. We don\u2019t have the privilege of, you know, doing it behind closed doors, and so, obviously, with that comes a certain responsibility, but I think, actually, there is no other way to do it. I think it\u2019s the only way to get it right. It does need to be in the public eye and it needs to be in this continuous iterative cycle because the rate of technological advancement right now is insane. \n\nAnd so, if you hold these systems back in the lab, you know, the difference between -- like if we had never released GPT-3 or 3.5 and we had just gone out with GPT-4 or ChatGPT, that would have shocked the world. It already did. And, you know, we had this continuous development cycle. \n\nAnd so, I think that\u2019s really important. But one of the things is to really -- from each deployment, every time that we put out a model, we learn something. We learn something about maybe, you know, the safety of our systems in the early development cycle or in post training or in the product cycle. Safety is really deeply embedded and integrated at each stage of developing and deploying these models. \n\nWe\u2019re constantly changing what we\u2019re doing because we\u2019re just constantly learning new things. Like every week, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re learning something new. And so, whether it\u2019s, you know, how you think about data, the data you\u2019re selecting and filtering and analyzing the data early on or about the RL -- the reinforcement learning with human feedback process that makes these models more aligned or you know classifiers that we use in production or the tools that we\u2019re making available for developers to have control and be able to be in the driver\u2019s seat and steer these models, all these pieces along the life cycle of taking research to production. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s a complicated set of things to manage these trade-offs. But I agree with you, I don\u2019t know if there is any other reasonable alternative. And, you know, the trick is like having lots and lots of inputs that are coming into you, like where you can sort of hear the -- you know, what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not working, like, what is the scrutiny, you know, like, which of the -- you know, which of the problems that, like, seem substantial or not? And, like, which of the, you know things that people are seeing, you know, in some weird permutation of how they\u2019re trying to use the product that you never imagined or intended, like -- \n\nMIRA MURATI: Exactly. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: -- it creates -- yeah. So, it is -- you know, on the one hand, like, you know, sort of very exciting, but it\u2019s also, like, a huge responsibility, I think.\n\nMIRA MURATI: It is. We\u2019re working on something that will hange everything. Will change the way that we work, the way that we interact with each other, and the way that we think and everything, really, all aspects of life. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I have one last question for you that I ask everybody who\u2019s on the podcast. I know you probably have no free time, given the intensity of the past, really, you know, year. But I ask everyone what they do outside of work for fun. \n\nMIRA MURATI: I love reading and I love going for hikes. Hiking is one of my favorite things to do, being in nature. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and, like, we live in a good place for hiking. \n\nMIRA MURATI: We do. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome, well, thank you so much, Mira, for taking time out of an incredibly busy schedule to have this conversation. I\u2019ve learned a ton and you know, just enjoyed this conversation, enjoy being able to work with you on a regular basis. \n\nMIRA MURATI: Awesome. I do, too. Thanks so much, Kevin. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So wow, that was a fascinating conversation with Mira Murati. As close partners, I get to work with Mira and her team all the time, helping to develop some of the big AI systems that they're building and then figuring out how to safely deploy those unbelievably sophisticated AI systems into the products that we're building. \n\nBut like I learned a ton about Mira today that I didn't know before. Like I knew she was from Albania, but I had known relatively little about how she first got interested in science and technology in the first place. And, you know, it was so great to hear about her, her teachers, her, you know, like always being ahead and having those teachers who were nurturing the curiosity that she had her going through her sister's textbooks when she got bored with the stuff that she was working on. Her sister's I think she's at a year and a half older than she was and then you know when she got bored with her sister's stuff you know figuring out you know what else there was to learn. \n\nAnd I think, you know, you sort of heard at a bunch of places in our conversation, like that, you know, what am I going to go learn next? Like, why is that thing important to learn? And this belief that there's always something more to go learn is like one of the things I think that has driven Mira to such success and the teams that she's responsible for leading to success. Uh, and I think it's a good piece of career advice for all of us to be just very intentional about how we're thinking about the activity that we're doing right now is an opportunity to learn something that will help us get better and better at our jobs and to be more purposeful about how we invest more of our energy in something into the future.\n\nIt was awesome to hear about her experience at Tesla, which I think has really shaped how she does her job as a leader and how she tackles like these sort of complicated things where they are multidisciplinary, you know, intersectional teams where you have to pull a lot of people together with a lot of different points of view to like do some of these super complicated things. And just, you know, hearing her talk about her passion for intelligence and like what that means for how we're going to interface with complicated bits of technology and, you know, like how they really have been thinking for a long while about how they take what they do and package it in a way where lots of people can use it. And where you really can unlock the imagination and the curiosity of a lot of other people. So like you're empowering them to use this technology to do the interesting things from their points of view. So anyway, it was just a sort of a fascinating conversation. \n\nThere were more tidbits in there. Like I found myself during the conversation remarking on several points where like she said something almost in passing that I thought were like real, super valuable nuggets of wisdom. So I hope everybody gets a chance to like reflect on what this, yeah, what this conversation really means. \n\nAnd that's all the time we have for today. Big thanks to Mira Murati for joining us.
