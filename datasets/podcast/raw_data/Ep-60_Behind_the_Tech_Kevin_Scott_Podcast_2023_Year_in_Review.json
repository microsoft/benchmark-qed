{"episode": "Ep-60 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast 2023 Year in Review", "text": "KEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we\u2019re going to get behind the tech. We\u2019ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what\u2019s happening today. Stick around.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello, and welcome to Behind The Tech. I\u2019m Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub, Christina Warren. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And here we are, at the end of 2023 already, and what a huge year it\u2019s been in our world. It\u2019s hard to believe how much has changed this past year what with like, the widespread adoption and explosion of AI into the world.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it has been a crazy and big year. I sort of feel, like, we\u2019re, like, living AI dog years, or something \u2013 \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: (Laughter.) Yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Where, you know, I just can\u2019t even believe how much has happened in the past six months, much less the whole year.\n\nSo, you know, obviously, this is the you know, in the past 12 months, we\u2019ve had ChatGPT released, we\u2019ve had GPT-4 released. And then we\u2019ve had this crazy explosion of generative AI activity across the board, from Microsoft and OpenAI, and a whole bunch of other companies. Like, it feels very much like, you know, what it\u2019s felt like a couple of times earlier in my career, where, you know, with the PC revolution, or the Internet revolution, or the smartphone revolution, where, like, a big platform thing is happening, and that everybody is excited about it. \n\nAnd the smartest and most ambitious people are putting all of their energy into figuring out what this all means for them, and, like, what useful things they\u2019re going to try to go make for other people on top of things that are newly possible. So, it\u2019s a super exciting moment. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: It\u2019s an extremely exciting moment. I\u2019ve been describing this to people for basically a year now. It\u2019s like, this is another iPhone moment, and that only becomes more and more true, I think, all the time. \n\nAnd on the podcast this year, it\u2019s been really exciting to hear folks talk about, as you say, what\u2019s been happening now and the stories behind, you know, the years and years of work and research that have gotten us to this place, because, of course, it feels like it\u2019s all happening right now, but this is the buildup of a lot of hard work. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: So, back in the spring, you got to talk to Bill Gates, who, obviously, is a huge force. Like, I think it\u2019s hard to express just how huge a force in technology he has been for decades. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, for sure. And, you know, like, obviously, Bill was one of the accelerators for the personal computing revolution.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, he played, you know, maybe the most pivotal role there in founding Microsoft in the first place, and, you know, pushing the personal computing revolution forward, and, like, played a tremendously important role in the Internet revolution, you know, honestly. And, you know, so it was really great to spend some time chatting with him about AI and his perspective on, like, what this moment means, like, how it is similar to some of the things that he\u2019s seen in the past. \n\nAnd like, obviously, Bill\u2019s also been thinking about AI for, you know, his entire career. And so, you know, for all of us who have an interest in technology, seeing a thing that has gone from, you know, promising, but not moving as fast as all of us ambitious, people would like, to actually making some pretty big breakthroughs has been just, I think, just as exciting for him as it has been for all of us.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, let\u2019s take a listen to that conversation.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I wonder what your advice might be to people who are thinking about like, oh, I have this new technology that\u2019s amazing that I can now use. Like, how should they be thinking about how to use it? Like, how should they be thinking about the urgency with which they are pursuing these new ideas? And like, how does that relate to how you thought about things in the PC era and the Internet era? \n\nBILL GATES: Yeah, so the industry starts really small where computers aren\u2019t personal. And then through the microprocessor and bunch of companies, we get the personal computer, IBM, Apple. And Microsoft got to be very involved in the software. You know, even the BASIC interpreter on the Apple II, a very obscure fact, was something that I did for Apple. And that idea that, wow, this is a tool that, at least for editing documents, that you have to do all the writing, you know, that was pretty amazing. And then connecting those up over the Internet was amazing. And then moving the computation into the mobile phone was absolutely amazing. So once you get the PC, the Internet, the software industry and the mobile phone, the digital world is changing huge, huge parts of our activities. \n\nI was just in India seeing this \u2013 how they do payments digitally, even for government programs. It\u2019s an amazing application of that world to help people who never would have bank accounts because the fees are just too high. It\u2019s too complicated. And so, we continue to benefit from that foundation. \n\nI do view this, the beginning of computers that read and write, as every bit as profound as any one of those steps. And a little bit surprising because robotics has gone a little slower than I would have expected. And I don\u2019t mean autonomous driving. I think that\u2019s a special case that\u2019s particularly hard because of the open-ended environment and the difficulty of safety and what safety bar people will bring to that. But even factories where you actually have huge control over the environment of what\u2019s going on and you can make sure that no kids are running around anywhere near that factory. \n\nSo a little bit people are saying, okay, these guys can over-predict, which that\u2019s certainly correct. But here\u2019s a case where we under-predicted that natural language and the computer\u2019s ability to deal with that and how that affects white collar jobs, including sales, service, helping a doctor think through what to put in your health record, that I thought was many years off. \n\nAnd so, all the AI books, even when they talk about things that might get a lot more productive, will turn out to be wrong. And because we\u2019re just at the start of this, you can almost call it a mania like the internet mania, but the internet mania, although it had its insanity and things that, I don\u2019t know, sock puppets or things where you look back and say, what were we thinking, it was a very profound tool that now we take for granted. And even just for scientific discovery during the pandemic, the utility of the immediate sharing that took place there was just phenomenal. And so, this is as big a breakthrough, a milestone as I\u2019ve seen in the whole digital computer realm, which really starts when I\u2019m quite young. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, well, so I\u2019m going to say this to you, and I\u2019m just interested in your reaction because like, you will always tell me when an idea is dumb. But like, one of the things that I\u2019ve been thinking for the last handful of years is that one of the big changes that\u2019s happening because of this technology is that for 180 years, from the point that Ada Lovelace wrote the first program to harness the power of a digital machine, up until today, the way that you\u2019d get a digital machine to do work for you is you either have to be a skilled programmer, which is like a barrier to entry that\u2019s not easy, or you have to have a skilled programmer anticipate the needs of the user and to build a piece of software that you can then use to get the machine to do something for you. \n\nAnd this may be the point where we get that paradigm to change a little bit, where because you have this natural language interface and these AIs can write code and like they will be able to actuate a whole bunch of services and systems, that we sort of give ordinary people the ability to get very complicated things done with machines, without having to have like all of this expertise that you and I spent many, many years building. \n\nI don\u2019t know whether you think that\u2019s a dumb idea or not.\n\nBILL GATES: No, absolutely, every advance hopefully lowers the bar in terms of who can easily take advantage of it. The spreadsheet was an example of that, because even though you still have to understand these formulas, you really didn\u2019t have to understand logic or symbols much at all. And it had the input and the output so closely connected in this grid structure that you didn\u2019t think about the separation of those two. And that\u2019s kind of limiting in a way to a super abstract thinker, but it was so powerful in terms of the directness; oh, that didn\u2019t come out right, let me change it. \n\nHere, there\u2019s a whole class of programs of taking like corporate data and presenting it or doing complex queries against, okay, have there been any sales offices where we\u2019ve had 20% of the headcount missing, and are our sales results affected by that? You can just \u2013 now you don\u2019t have to go to the IT department and wait in line and have them tell you, oh, that\u2019s too hard or something. \n\nMost of these corporate learning things, whether it\u2019s a query or a report or even a simple workflow where if something happens, you want to trigger an activity, the description in English will be the program. And when you want it to do something extra, you\u2019ll just pull out that English, or whatever your language is, and type that in. And so, there\u2019s a whole layer of query assistance and programing that will be accessible to any employee. \n\nAnd the same thing is true of, okay, I\u2019m somewhere in the college application process and I want to know, okay, what\u2019s my next step and what\u2019s the threshold for these things? It\u2019s so opaque today. So empowering people to go directly and interact, that is the theme that this is trying to enable.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: It was incredible to get to talk with Bill, not only about the specifics of how all of this stuff works, but also to get a sense of the big picture for this historic moment that we\u2019re in, as you alluded to, Kevin. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, it has been a very long and winding road to get to where we are right now. And, you know, you said it earlier. This is, you know, may feel like, you know, all of a sudden it broke through and it was very abrupt, but it was because of decades and decades of work that, you know, just an untold number of people have been doing. \n\nBut it has been really interesting, working with the folks at OpenAI. And we had this incredibly interesting conversation with Mira Murati, who is OpenAI\u2019s CTO, about, you know, her perspective is, like, you know, sitting effectively in the hot seat of, you know, developing one of the most interesting pieces of technology that's resulted in the, you know, this breakthrough moment that we\u2019ve had this past year.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: For sure. Let\u2019s take a listen.\n\nMIRA MURATI: You know, the first time that we thought about deploying this models that were just in research territory was kind of this insane idea. It wasn\u2019t normal back then to go deploy a large language model in the real world. And, you know, what is the business case? What is it actually going to do for people? What problems is it going to solve? Like, we didn\u2019t really have those answers. \nBut we thought, you know, if we make it accessible in such a way that it\u2019s easy to use and it is cheap to use, it is highly optimized, you don\u2019t need a lot of -- you don\u2019t need to know all the bells and whistles of machine learning and just accessible, then maybe people\u2019s creativity would just bring to life, you know, new products and solutions and we\u2019d see how this technology could help us in the real world. \nAnd, of course, we had a hypothesis, but really it was just putting GPT-3 in the API the first time that we saw people interact with these large language models and the technology that we were building and that for so many years we\u2019d just been building in the lab without, you know, this real-world contact and feedback from people out there. \nSo, that was the first time. It was sort of this leap of faith that it was going to teach us something, we were going to learn something from it. And, hopefully, we could feed it back into the technology. We could bring back that knowledge, that feedback, and figure out how to use it to make the technology better, more reliable, more aligned, safer, more robust when it eventually gets deployed in the real world. \n\nAnd, you know, I always believe that you can\u2019t just build this powerful technology in the lab with no contact with reality and hope that somehow it\u2019s going to go well and that it\u2019s going to be safe and beneficial for all. And, somehow, you do need to figure out how to bring society along both in gathering that feedback and insight, but also in adjusting society to this change. \nAnd the best way to do that is for people to actually interact with the technology and see for themselves, instead of, you know, telling them or just sharing scientific papers. So that was very important. And it took us, then, a couple of years to get to the point where we were not just releasing improvements to the model through the API, but in fact, the first interface that was more consumer facing that we played around with was DALL-E. DALL-E Labs, where people could just input a prompt in natural language and then you\u2019d see these beautiful, original, amazing images come up. \nAnd then, you know, really for research reasons, we were experimenting with this interface of dialogue where you go back and forth with the model and ChatGPT and dialogue is such a powerful tool, you know, the idea of Socratic dialogue and how -- how people learn, you can sort of correct one another and/or ask questions, get really to deeper truth. \nAnd so, we thought, you know, if we put this out there, even with the existing models, we will learn a lot. We will get a lot of feedback and we can use this feedback to actually make our upcoming model that at the time was GPT-4 safer and more aligned. \nSo, that was kind of the motivation. And, of course, as we saw, you know, in just a few days, it became super popular and people just loved interacting with this AI system.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: So, when we talk about AI and we think about this stuff, it has been so powerful and so public, the way I think that the whole world has kind of been getting to learn about an experience, the challenges of this new wave of AI. You know, kind of feel like we are in this, you know, before ChatGPT, after ChatGPT world. And that\u2019s really been evident this year. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And, you know, we had a really great opportunity on the podcast and, you know, me, personally, in my professional life, to have a bunch of really important conversations with Kevin Roose, from the New York Times. \n\nSo, you know, I think journalism has this really important role to play in helping frame what\u2019s happening right now. So, like, we\u2019re doing part of the job, which is develop the technology and, like, try to responsibly get it deployed out to the public. But that\u2019s a tiny little part of the job of figuring out how to get AI into the hands of the public in a reasonable way. \n\nAnd so, yeah, I\u2019ve been super excited to have those conversations with journalists this year. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, this conversation that you had with Kevin is actually one of my favorites this year, A, because he\u2019s a former colleague, and B, because I really do think, as you say, journalists play a really important role in, I think, helping kind of bridge the understanding gap between what it is that is being created, and all the things that we\u2019re working so hard on, and how the general public is going to be able to kind of understand and synthesize what all this means for them. So this is a great conversation, yeah. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and for me, personally, just, you know \u2013 for me, personally, you know, it also serves this really important role of making sure that you\u2019re not getting trapped in your own little bubble, that, you know, if you sit around and all you do is talk to your fellow technologists all day long, you can get convinced to some pretty wonky things. (Laughter.) And it\u2019s, like, really useful to have journalists, and academics, and policymakers, and, you know, and, like, my mom in rural Central Virginia able to, like, knock you out of your bubble think. (Laughter.)\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I think you\u2019re exactly right. I mean, and I think that that\u2019s how we make sure that this is stuff that is not just useful in theory and, as you say, in our own bubbles, but it\u2019s actually something that could be world changing. So, great conversation here.\n\nKEVIN ROOSE: We are building some of the most \u2013 we, I say we. I mean you essentially and your peers in the tech industry are building some of the most powerful technology ever created. And I think without the media, there just wouldn\u2019t be a kind of countervailing sort of, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s, you know, a force on the minds of the people building that technology or just a caution around the technology, but I\u2019ll give you an example of what I mean. So, you know, you and I had this now infamous encounter back in February \u2013\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\nKEVIN ROOSE: where you guys had just released Bing with this, you know, what we now know as GPT-4 running inside of it, and I had this insane conversation with Bing Chat, aka Sydney. Please don\u2019t hurt me, Sydney. \n\nAnd, you know, it went on the front page, went totally viral, blew up, I\u2019m sure, you know, your inbox, my inbox, everyone\u2019s inbox for months. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Everybody\u2019s inbox...\nKEVIN ROOSE: And subsequent to that, like I started hearing from, you know, just in a nutshell, if people aren\u2019t familiar, it was a conversation that sort of lasted two hours in which Bing/Sydney, you know, confessed all these sort of dark secrets and tried to break up my marriage, and it was insane. \nAnd \u2013 and subsequent to that story running, I got notes from a lot of other people at tech companies saying, you know, how do we prevent our technology from doing that. Or even \u2013 I got a leaked document from another big tech company, which had a sort of roadmap for their AI product, and listed on the roadmap was like, \u201cDo not break up Kevin Roose\u2019s marriage.\u201d\nAnd so, I really think that like that \u2013 and not to toot my own horn, this could have been anyone, but it did really like serve as a cautionary tale for other companies that are building similar technology. \nAnd so, I think that is what the media can and should do in moments of societal transformation and change is really hold a \u2013 you know, hold up a sign that basically tells people like, you know, you want to do this right or, you know, there will be \u2013 you know, there may be consequences for that. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and I think that is one of the very good things that came out of that experience. And, you know, it also, I think, is a \u2013 it\u2019s another important reason why it is I think you actually want to launch these things, you know, even if it results in something that floods your inbox, you know, for a while, is like you just sort of get the societal level conversation about, you know, what\u2019s possible, what\u2019s going on, like, where\u2019s the line, like, what\u2019s good, what\u2019s bad. \nI mean, we haven\u2019t chatted since that story published, and one thing that I will say is, like, I deeply appreciate the part of the writing that you did, where you publish the full transcript of the conversation. So like that level of transparency, like it just wasn\u2019t confusing to anyone about, you know, like, what inputs into the system led to like, the things that it gave back, and like, that was super good. \nI don\u2019t think many of the people who were coming into my inbox had read the full transcript, but I think that you\u2019re just 100% spot on. Like, the existence of this thing has, like, helped a lot of people, like just make sure that they\u2019re paying real attention to some very important things. \nKEVIN SCOTT: And also you know, some of this stuff is fuzzy, right, like, you know, where the line is, and like, part of what you all are helping doing is making sure that the public is paying enough attention to it, so they can weigh in and have an opinion about where the line should be.\nKEVIN ROOSE: Absolutely, I mean, it is an area where I think more public opinion is good. And right now, the number of people who are actually building this technology is like quite small, relative to the number of people who are using it, or who will soon be using it. \nAnd so, I just think like, the more people know about what\u2019s going on, the better, and I think it\u2019ll ultimately be good for the tech industry to have that kind of feedback, even if it is annoying and blows up your inbox in the moment.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and for what it\u2019s worth, it was like I was never annoyed about that. I was sometimes \u2013\nKEVIN ROOSE: You were remarkably chill. I was pleasantly surprised by like, the response that, you know, you and I talked after I had had this conversation, but before I sort of published my story, and, you know, you didn\u2019t freak out, you didn\u2019t accuse me of lying. You know, it was a remarkably civil conversation. \nAnd I have appreciated that because that\u2019s not \u2013 and I\u2019m not just blowing smoke here, like that is not the reaction that I expected, you know, given how these things can go with other tech leaders. \nSo you know, I think, you know, I\u2019m hopeful that the response to that article has not \u2013 the lesson from that has not been that we should build in secret and should never let anyone try our stuff. \nKEVIN SCOTT: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.\nKEVIN ROOSE: I hope that it has like been sort of salutary for the whole project of building good and safe and responsible AI to like, have some feedback along the way.\nKEVIN SCOTT: One hundred percent. Like, I don\u2019t think anybody was \u2013 like, I\u2019m genuinely trying to think if anyone was irritated. Like everybody is sort of like, okay, this is good, lesson learned, and like, you know, we have a whole bunch of mechanism for, you know, preventing things like that from happening again. And, I mean, just \u2013 it\u2019s all good. \nSomebody said to me at some point that, like all feedback is a gift. Like, the fact that you spent two hours trying very hard to get this thing to do unusual things, and then publish the whole transcript, and then wrote this article that helps people pay more attention to the importance of responsible AI, like all of that\u2019s a gift, like and that\u2019s the way you should just sort of look at it.\n\nKEVIN ROOSE: Yeah, I\u2019ll remind, you know, tech executives of that the next time I get an angry call from a comms department. You know, Kevin Scott thinks feedback is a gift. So maybe you guys should get on board with that. \nI did also hear that you guys had Sydney swag made, and I\u2019m a little offended that none of that has shown up in my house.\nKEVIN ROOSE: Did you hear about the beer? So this was my\nKEVIN SCOTT: I did.\nKEVIN ROOSE: my favorite thing that came out of that article was that there was a brewery in Minneapolis that \u2013 that came out with a beer called, Sydney Loves Kevin. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\nKEVIN ROOSE: And I have not tried it yet. I heard it was good. But, you know, maybe you and I can get a pint of it sometime.\nKEVIN SCOTT: We should absolutely make a road trip to Minnesota to get a pint. That would be hilarious.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, you know, it\u2019s just so exciting to me, how much technology and AI are becoming part of the mainstream conversation. It really does make me think about the episode we did with Neil deGrasse Tyson, who is one of my heroes. Like, in addition to being a brilliant astrophysicist, Neil, I think is, in my opinion, the best science communicator since Carl Sagan. And I think, you know, Neil tried to model a lot of what he\u2019s doing after Carl. And, you know, he just does a terrific job of helping explain some incredibly complicated scientific concepts to the public, but not in a condescending way. So, I just love Neil to death. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I do, too. He\u2019s also one of my heroes, and I think you\u2019re exactly right. He is definitely one of our best, if, you know, not the best, like, living science communicator that we have. And I think it\u2019s so important that we have people like him in these moments. As you say, I think helps get us out of our bubbles a little bit, and also, I think, helps put this, again, into terms that people who might not follow along with every little thing can understand and - and get excited about, and also start to think the important questions about. So, this is a great conversation with Neil.\n\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Right, right. Well, actually, so I think much less about kids than I do about adults because kids are born curious and they retain that curiosity  middle school \u2013 so I'm not so worried about them as I am about adults, who think they're thinking rationally, and are not, and adults are in charge of the world. They wield resources, they vote, they lead. They're captains of industry. They're all the things that shape this world.\n\nSo yeah, we can target children, but I'm too impatient. I don't want to wait 30 years until they're old enough to then make a difference. Whereas adults can make a difference with a signature \u2013 with a pen at the bottom of a document that puts a new legislation into effect or a new educational directives or new mission statements. So that's been my goal. Now, in terms of role model, I think the term is a little overplayed, overvalued, I should say, for the following reason.\n\nI grew up in the Bronx, New York. And if I needed another Black person who grew up in the Bronx before me, who then became an astrophysicist, to have preceded me, I would have never become an astrophysicist. So role models, inherent \u2013 as they are generally thought of \u2013 inherently require that you are not the first to do something. But suppose you have interest where you would be the first to do something, either first out of your town. Like you said, you're the first. What's your role model can't have been people in your town because none of them went to college. So \u2013 or in your family. All right?\n\nSo at some point you have to say my role model is someone I have never met, and I may never meet, but I know enough about them that I want to emulate what happened in their life. And so for me, I knew this from very early. So I had an athletic role model of, you know, baseball, of course. I grew up in the Bronx where the Yankees play. So there was a Yankee that was a role model, I didn't want to be him. Just said if I played baseball, I wanted to play baseball as well as he did. All right? That's all. And I visited my local planetarium. The Hayden Planetarium. Took extra classes there. They had educators and scientists, and they had educators that had such a way with words and storytelling. I said, if I'm ever an educator, that's the kind of educator I want to be. And the scientists had such command of \u2013 and they just knew so much.\n\nAnd the weird thing is, I remembered thinking, I will never know this much about the universe as much as they do, meanwhile they're twice my age at least, and I'm 15 when I'm having these thoughts, okay? And not realizing that when you get a PhD, you spend a whole five, six years studying that one subject. All right? And six years before that, I was nine. So I had to get the timescales understood within me. But, so, for me, a role model at its best is assembled a la carte from different people. And that's why, if you're visible, you should always, in the back of your head, ask yourself: Am I being something that someone else might want to emulate? Because that chance is very real, whether or not you ever meet the person.\n\nAnd so when I see little children coming through \u2013 the Hayden Planetarium is part of the American Museum of Natural History. There's school groups that come through. Many tourists, international tourists, but also camp groups. I see little kids and they're looking bright eyed. And all I've committed is that whatever I help create there will have the impact on that next generation the way the educators and scientists had an impact on me. Then I've given back to this world.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And then when we talk about how important it is to bring people into science and technology, a lot of that, I think, comes from being able to inspire them and their creative minds. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, there are so many structural barriers for a lot of people. And it\u2019s really easy, I think, for folks to get confused about how much luck and good fortune is involved in, you know, all of us who have the privilege of having interesting, you know, careers, where we get to, like, have a little slice of impact on - on an industry, like, how much luck plays a role in that for us. \n\nAnd so, you know, William Adams, who worked for me for a while at OCTO \u2013 he\u2019s one of the first people I hired when I came to work for Microsoft \u2013 is just an incredible human being, like, a source of inspiration for me, personally. And the extent to which he has dedicated his life, not just to being a better engineer, but as a Black engineer, trying to figure out, like, how he goes and addresses some of those structural impediments to having more folks who are historically underrepresented in this field, be able to participate, like, it\u2019s just really, really inspiring, seeing what Will has chosen to do with his life.\n\nWILLIAM ADAMS: Yeah, well, let \u2013 let me put on my speed mouth then. The general \u2013 the general thing is, and this started back with when George Floyd was killed. I kind of really sat and thought, it\u2019s like, okay, what am I going to do? I mean, this is not the first black man who\u2019s ever been killed by police. He\u2019s not going to be the last, but this is a good moment, because it was caught on 4K video. People are kind of paying attention. What am I going to do, right?\n\nAnd I \u2013 one thought was, well, I\u2019ve got money, I can just kind of throw money out to people, you know \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and \u2013 and be that kind of philanthropist. It\u2019s like, nah, that \u2013 once your money is gone, that \u2013 that effect is gone. Well, I have 40+ years in tech, and I know that tech billionaires are kind of the top of the world right now. So, that means there\u2019s more money in tech. Why don\u2019t I help get more people into tech, right? \n\nSo then, that led to, well, there\u2019s lots of different models for that as well. I could invest. I could be a \u2013 an LP in someone else\u2019s thing, or whatever. There\u2019s lots of different ways of doing it. And I just came up with the models, like, well, what matches my skills and experience and network best? \n\nSo, I came up with the studio model, right, a venture studio. And the difference between a venture studio and a plain old VC is \u2013 or an accelerator is I tell people think of Motown, right? There \u2013 I\u2019m the Berry Gordy, right? I\u2019m going to find the talent; I\u2019m going to train the talent. I\u2019m going to find Aretha Franklin; I\u2019m going to find Michael Jackson. I\u2019m going to help show them how to dance, stage presence, give them the record contract, put them out on \u2013 in the network and help them build their thing, right? \nDo that with software. So, it\u2019s about creating software, creating a network, having a finance network, having resources as simple as, as soon as you start your business, you need a tax accountant, or else you\u2019re just going to fall behind on your taxes, and you\u2019re going to be out of business in a year. You need an admin, you know? (Laughter.) So, you need three or four programmers. You\u2019re not going to write the code yourself. \nAnd when you fail, you need someone to say, that\u2019s all right, let\u2019s do it again, right? And this is something that typically, black and women businesses don\u2019t have, right? They struggled to do it once. They get burned. They\u2019re working at McDonald\u2019s, or they\u2019re back to general population. They don\u2019t try again, because they\u2019ve got obligations. \nSo, the studio is intended to put a little cushion that they don\u2019t normally have in the \u2013 in this society, such that they can have enough longevity to succeed, right? So, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of network building. I\u2019ve been writing tons of code, because the \u2013 the other thing that I\u2019m telling people is, okay, AI is the thing. Two years ago, I would have told you, go out and learn you some C sharp, you know, and Web development.\nNow it\u2019s like, no, no, no. First, you need to go play with ChatGPT. And if you\u2019re going to write any code at all, you\u2019re going to use copilot, right? And I\u2019m not just saying that because I\u2019m shilling for Microsoft. It\u2019s like, I do it myself, and it makes me 30% more productive, at least. So, I tell them that, and the software I\u2019m writing is about saying, how can I write code such that it\u2019s going to be more composable when I use AI to do it, right? \nSo, for example, there\u2019s a ZIP, the ZIP file format, right, compressed files. There\u2019s a library for that, and it has its quirks. I wrote one myself; I have my own ZIP decoder. And the interface is so simple that when I want to say, now compress that and stick it in the ZIP, it\u2019s one function, three parameters, done, right?\nClear licensing. I don\u2019t have to worry about all the licensing all over the place. And that\u2019s a difficulty when you start stitching with AI. It\u2019s like, well, wait a minute, where did that data come from? Where did that code come from? (Laughter.) Where did \u2013 do you have the right license for that chunk of code right there? \nSo, I\u2019m creating a substrate of code that\u2019s like, this is clear licensed, right? And here\u2019s how you program leveraging AI, right? This is how we have to do it. This is how we\u2019re going to 10x our abilities, right, is by deleveraging AI. You can\u2019t just go and lock yourself in a room and think you\u2019re going to hammer out some code, because by the time you\u2019re done, someone else has got \u2013 AI has already done it 10x over. So, you better learn how to do it with AI, right? So, this is \u2013 this is what I\u2019m currently engaged in.\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, honestly, William\u2019s work, what he\u2019s doing is so inspiring, as you say, and what he\u2019s accomplished in his time at Microsoft and now, after Microsoft, is so impressive. And I loved that conversation between the two of you, and it\u2019s great that we have people like him who are doing this important work, and really working to inspire the next generation. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, for \u2013 for sure. I mean, maybe - maybe the theme of this podcast, like the people that we talk to, are folks who are just deeply passionate about something and who are fully committed to pursuing that passion. And it\u2019s just a great pleasure to be able to chat with so many people who have that - that mindset. \n\nAnd, you know, one of those conversations that we had this year was with my very favorite science fiction author right now, Adrian Tchaikovsky, who has written just really incredible, hard science fiction books. You know, he\u2019s got a super interesting background, as many science fiction authors do. Like, he is a zoologist and lawyer, you know, by training.\n\nAnd, you know, I think he wrote, maybe inadvertently, like, one of the most important books on contemporary artificial intelligence, which was the third installment of a trilogy that he wrote called Children of Memory, where, of all things, pairs of corvids, you know, intelligent birds are maybe the best metaphor that I have seen for large language models, which is just an incredible, you know, thing, that that came from his imagination before large language models really were doing some of the things that they could do. \n\nAnd so, it was just tremendous to be able to spend some time talking with Adrian, not just about his craft, but about what inspires him to write the things that he does, and, like, what some of his takes are, as a creative person, like a writer, about what this AI moment means for him and people practicing his craft. So, like, it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s just a great conversation and \u2013 and wanted to get people a chance to listen to a little snippet of that conversation in this - in this year in review we\u2019re doing here.\n\nADRIAN TCHAIKOVSKY: I mean, when I\u2019m working from the point of view of a non-human entity, whether it\u2019s a sort of an uplifted animal, or an alien or something like that, it\u2019s generally the start point is the input. So, you look at what senses it has, how it experiences the world around it, and that then \u2013 that gives you a very good filter through which to look at the world and interpret the things that are going on around this particular character. It gives it its own sort of set of priorities that can be quite different to human, because we\u2019re very limited to our senses. I mean, that \u2013 our entire picture of what goes on around us is fed to us through the various ways that we sense our environment. \n\nAnd when those ways go wrong, or when those ways are giving us uncertain information, you can get some sort of profoundly weird and dysfunctional worldviews generating from that, which can be extremely hard to dissuade someone from, even if \u2013 even if you knew that you had a problem, which meant that, you know, you were seeing things, you were hallucinating. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the hallucinations aren\u2019t themselves still incredibly powerful. \n\nI mean, it\u2019s very hard not to react to a thing that your eyes are telling you is there. I mean, sleep paralysis is a perfect example of that, because most people who have it are well aware of what\u2019s going on when it\u2019s happening, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less scary.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, I think a really good example of this are the Portids from the Children of Time, which are the spiders who are the\u2026 you know, become the protagonists of the story. And, you know, I don\u2019t want to give too much away about the book, for folks who haven\u2019t read it, but you basically develop this very complicated society of intelligent spiders, and, which is a really interesting premise. And, like, part of what makes them so compelling is that their sensorium is very different from humans. You want to talk about that a little bit?\n\nADRIAN TCHAIKOVSKY: Yeah. So, I mean\u2026 I mean, weirdly enough, they are \u2013 they\u2019re also still considerably more human than either of the two major non-human points of view presented in the next book. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yep.\n\nADRIAN TCHAIKOVSKY: Because they\u2019re still very visual creatures, they\u2019re land creatures. And there is a certain kind of factor in their evolution, which is going to make them more human than they might otherwise be. But at the same time, so, spiders have a whole suite of senses that we can\u2019t really easily imagine. They have the ability to sense \u2013 sort of scents and chemicals in a way that we can\u2019t. They have ability, especially, to sense vibration in the way that we can\u2019t. So, they live in a world that is constantly informing them of things that we would be completely oblivious to. \n\nAnd so\u2026 and the way I go about this is I kind of work in sort of organic stages. Well, you know, if they\u2019re like this, then what would their \u2013 what would their sort of early development would be, and then just building on each other at each stage to make this more and more complex society, as they go through \u2013 as the book takes them through time. \n\nAnd you get a society which has a lot of, for example, technology that builds on their own strengths. They can do a lot of things that we can\u2019t quite early on, purely because they have a lot of tools, even down to just being able to spin web, which gives you the ability to make, say, watertight containers very, very early on in your society, which is a major \u2013 you know, making things like clay pots, and so forth, is a major step forwards for human society. And it\u2019s much harder for us because we have to use fire, and we have to make them, whereas the spiders can just literally produce them from their own bodies. \n\nAnd so, little things like that then go on to have enormous implications to how their society develops. And it also affects the way that they\u2019re\u2026 they conceptualize of more \u2013 of less kind of physical things. So, you have one point where there\u2019s an effort to try and communicate a picture from one culture to another, and they run into the basic problem that when a human is coding a picture in a sort of a mathematical form, we start at the top left, or where \u2013 you know, one of the corners, depending \u2013 you know, possibly culturally dependent. And we work \u2013 work through the rows.\n\nThe spiders start in the middle and spiral outward. That makes perfect sense for them, because how can you necessarily know how big the picture is going to be when you start it? You don\u2019t know. And so, you just start and keep working until you\u2019ve got all the picture. \n\nBut it means that a lot of basic ideas, even when they have a means of communication, become very hard to communicate, because the way you\u2019re thinking about them is very different.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, I loved hearing Adrian talk about, you know, how he\u2019s thinking about creating these species and civilizations. I still fundamentally consider myself a writer, first and foremost. And so, I love hearing about the creative process that other writers, writers more talented than me, like him, can do, and how also kind of thinking in the broader terms about how, you know, sensory input and, you know, can shape kind of everything, and how we operate, and kind of the influence, you know, art can have on science, and vice versa. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, another person who\u2019s thinking about some of this stuff in a really significant way was on the podcast this year. So, and one of our most engaging conversations, the pioneer of emotion AI, Rana\u00a0el Kaliouby. She believes, and I agree with her, that we\u2019re missing out on a huge amount of data that we could be using to train our AIs to make these systems more\u2026 not human like, but more relatable to humans. We had a super interesting conversation, which we\u2019re going to listen to right now.\n\nRANA EL KALIOUBY: Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s exactly what your friend is saying. Like empathy and emotions are at the center of how connect and communicate as humans, and our emotional experiences drive our decision making, whether it\u2019s a big decision or a small decision. It drives our learning, our memory. It drives this human connection. \nIt\u2019s how we build trust, it\u2019s everything, but if you look at how we think about technology, it\u2019s often what I call the IQ of the device. You know, take ChatGPT, right? Very smart, very intelligent, but it\u2019s all very focused on the IQ, the cognitive skills, and I felt like it was out of balance with our emotional and social intelligence skills, and I wanted to marry the IQ and the EQ in our machines, basically.\nAnd so I had to go back. I\u2019m a computer scientist by background, and I had to like study the emotion \u2013 the science of emotion, and how do we express emotions as human beings, and it turns out, 93% of how we communicate is nonverbal. It\u2019s a combination of our facial expressions, our hand gestures, our vocal intonations, how much energy is in our voice, all of these things, and only 7% is in the actual choice of words you use.\nSo I feel like there\u2019s been a lot of emphasis on the seven percent, but the 93% has been lost in cyberspace, and so I\u2019m kind of reclaiming that 93%, using computer vision and machine learning technologies that weren\u2019t available, you know, 20 years ago, but now they\u2019re ubiquitous.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, look, I think you are absolutely right. In 2016 I dialed back almost all of my social media consumption because you effectively have these machine learning systems, like particularly for businesses where their business model is engagement, so \u2013 like the more you engage with the platform, the more ads run, and the more money that you make. It is very easy to like get systems that get the engagement by triggering your amygdala and like keep you in this \u2013 and it\u2019s very easy to be triggered by email.\nLike I, all the time, have email conversations with colleagues, where I get super agitated by the email conversation and if I just jump into a video call with them, even, like not even face to face, but you know, what we\u2019re doing right now, like in \u2013 in seconds, like all of the stuff that I was agitated about goes away.\nSo I\u2019m just super intrigued by what you\u2019re doing. Like how do we actually get this rolled out more broadly because I think you\u2019re absolutely right. Like we\u2019ve focused so much on the text and text is so rife with opportunity to get us emotionally activated in the wrong way.\nRANA EL KALIOUBY: In the wrong way, right, because there\u2019s a lot of confusion and ambiguity where you can clarify that when you see the face or hear the voice. I mean, I think what\u2019s really cool about this, and what ended up being both the opportunity, but also the biggest challenge for Affectiva, you know, when we spun out of MIT, was that there are so many applications of this technology.\nAnd so we tried to focus, but it was always this challenge of like, \"Oh, my God, like there are so many cool applications,\" and so some that I think are really powerful. One is the automotive industry where, you know, we ended up selling to Smart Eye, and they\u2019re very focused on bringing driver monitoring solutions to the world, and so this idea of understanding driver distraction, and you know, if you\u2019re texting while driving.\nWell, we can tell that, using computer vision, right? Look at your eyes, your head movements, and if you have a phone in your hand, drowsiness, intoxication, even. We can \u2013 we\u2019ve started like doing a lot of research to detect that, using cameras, you know, optical sensors. So automotive is one area. \nWe can do advanced safety solutions. We can look at, like is there a child seat in the car, and an infant in it, and often \u2013 not often, but about 50 kids or so get forgotten in the car every year, and they die of heat, so that\u2019s very fixable. We can fix that.\nMental health is another space that I\u2019m really fascinated by, that we know that there are facial and vocal biomarkers of mental health disease, depression, anxiety, stress, even Parkinson\u2019s. So imagine if we \u2013 every time we hop in front of our computer, with people\u2019s opt in, of course, we can kind of articulate your baseline, using machine learning.\nWe know your baseline, and then if you start deviating from it, we can flag that to you, a loved one, or \u2013 you know, a psychiatrist. So I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity, but we\u2019re missing the scale.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, it\u2019s definitely exciting to think about where we might be able to go with this idea of EQ.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, for sure.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And so, that actually kind of makes me think about how connected to creativity so many of our guests have been, as we\u2019ve kind of been going through this year in review. And so, let\u2019s share a clip now from will.i.am. He talked about technology, and how it changed the music industry in a super, super interesting way.\n\nWILL.I.AM: Yeah, so imagine this is 1970, and you\u2019re a drummer from a band that\u2019s pretty popular. And you\u2019re a drummer that\u2019s coming up, and you have aspirations as a drummer. And then, like, there was a drum machine, but you weren\u2019t really threatened by the drum machine, because it sounded like (doot-doot-doot). It didn\u2019t really sound like drums. And then the \u201880s come around and the LINN-900, and it started sounding a little bit more realistic, but it was, like, stiff and robotic. And then Prince really, like, made some pretty awesome songs with the LINN-900. \n\nAnd then the Akai MPC60 drum machine came, and you could sample live drums, and put the swing on it, and it kind of sounds realistic. And then 2000 comes around, you\u2019re like, yo, fuck these drum machines, bro. Like, all the songs on the radio are fucking drum machines. \n\nIn the \u201870s, it was all human beings, tight, and you have to be super precise. And the drum machine ate up a lot of the freaking, like, drum time for - for drummers on the radio. And since then, live drums on the radio and on streaming, you don\u2019t hear no live drums anywhere on the radio. \n\nBut what happened was the drummer, a lot of them became the producer, because they were like, you know what, if this is the case, I\u2019m going to learn this machine and I\u2019m going to produce the role of the drummer. They made more money. They \u2013 because the drummer never got publishing anyways, because how can you what\u2019s the publishing on drums, right? \n\nSo, the drummer in the band always got the shitty end of the stick when it came to ownership of the song, because how - what part did you write? I wrote this: (drum sounds). Everybody says (drum sounds). No, I said (different drum sounds). Yep, everybody says (different drum sounds). So, when it came to the how everyone participated, the drummer was always, you know, last, and that sucks. But the drum machine and producing on computers really empowered the drummer. \n\nThe same is for music, the whole entire package now, not just drums. It\u2019s guitars, it\u2019s bass lines, it\u2019s freaking chord progressions, ensembles, like, orchestral. Everything of music is now going through what the drummer went through in the \u201870s to the 2000\u2019s.\n\nNow the guy with the idea, the girl with the idea, the person with the idea, now they don\u2019t need the whole entire studio. They don\u2019t need a whole entire band. They just need their idea, and the machine will supercharge them. The way the drum machine and the print \u2013 and the DAW supercharged the drummer. That\u2019s the optimistic point of it all. \n\nThen there\u2019s, like, a bunch of negative stuff that I don\u2019t even want to entertain, because I think what we should be doing with AI is not just to augment yesterday. Yes, it\u2019s going to, you know, render how we used to do things kind of obsolete or create new ways of doing things that undermine, like, how we used to get paid. There\u2019s going to be new ways that we get paid. \n\nA song is going to be a lot deeper right now. But MTV said, \u201cHey, no, don\u2019t just write the song. Do a video.\u201d That video used to be just promotion if you wanted to go and sing in a \u2013 you know, you\u2019re from LA, but you want to tour all of America. Other locations were like, well, send me like a demo of what your show is going to be and I could put you on TV. So, they would do that promo clip that MTV hijacked and said, \u201cThese are videos.\u201d \n\nThose are promo clips. That was never a part of what a record contract was to be. And a record contract was based on the limitation of lacquer. And even though we had technology, like mini discs and CDs, that there were no more limitations, music is still composed as if there were limited space on a disk. A song is three minutes and 33 seconds, an album is 12 songs on it just because of the RPMs 33 that it went around the record. And the tempos of every pop song was limited. \n\nSo, even with, you know, with this advanced technology that we have, it\u2019s still basing it on limited. So, that means you have to reimagine what a song is, just like they reimagined what a song was from the 1800\u2019s when it was just theater and opera. When it came to the recording industry, they\u2019re like, okay, okay, we\u2019ve got to change to a different song format here. \n\nYou know, \u201cMuddy Waters, that song is too long. I need you to shorten it,\u201d because when they would sing the blues, they would sing - there was no time limit. They would just go to a bar. You hear somebody sing, and they sung for fucking hours. A song is like a reduction of the song sequence because of a limitation of the technology. \n\nSo, that means with AI and AI music, somebody has to reimagine what the fuck a song is. It\u2019s a discussion. It\u2019s a place for you to put your memories, a place for the song to alter, based on your mood. Like, \u201cI Gotta Feeling\u201d is not just for \u2013 what\u2019s the version of \u201cI Gotta Feeling\u201d when you\u2019re pissed? I just wrote the one that you\u2019re - when you\u2019re optimistic. \u201cWhere Is the Love?\u201d is like when something goes wrong. What about when something is right?\n\nLike, and then there are song like \u201cBoom Boom Pow\u201d that are about nothing. Hey, what\u2019s \u201cBoom Boom Pow\u201d about? I don\u2019t know, nothing. Like, it\u2019s describing the song. (Laughter.) This song is promoting the song that I wrote. What song? This one, right here, that I\u2019m singing (laughter) which is a crazy concept of songwriting. Like, what are you going to write about? I don\u2019t really know, though. I\u2019m going to write about this song I\u2019m writing. (Laughter.)\n\nBut you have to change \u2013 it\u2019s an opportunity to reimagine what a song is, to reimagine what it means in your life, to reimagine what it means to the world with percussion and bass. And I think we need to, like, inspire the creative community to use AI, not just for entertainment, but to reimagine the world.\n\nTomorrow\u2019s industries are what? Tomorrow\u2019s jobs are what? If AI is going to replace jobs, it\u2019s going to create new jobs. So, shouldn\u2019t the creative community also be tasked to, like, imagine what tomorrow is with it? Are we just going to freaking pretend that we\u2019re going to make songs forever? No, that ain\u2019t the case. You ain\u2019t going to be making songs forever for business, like we used to. You\u2019re going to be making experiences with it. You\u2019re going to be scoring moments and different ways of scoring moments, but it isn\u2019t going to look anything like yesterday. No.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right, I really am seeing a theme here, you know, kind of seeing the intersection of creativity, and innovation and technology, and how all of these things influence one another. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, even Tobi L\u00fctke, who is one of my absolute favorite engineers, in addition to being the incredible entrepreneur and founder of Shopify, and I were talking about some of these ideas about the change that\u2019s coming and how change influences the nature of craft and creativity. We had a really fascinating conversation where we reflected on this, which you all are going to get to hear a little bit of right now.\n\nTOBI L\u00dcTKE: Absolutely. The core of a craft is like converting something into something, right? Like, like any craft that exists is sort of a \u2013 that particular process is like people who convert wood into furniture are carpenters.\nOne thing which is really inspired about these things is that they really \u2013 it\u2019s the identity of a carpenter, that they are a carpenter. Their identity is actually that they\u2019re a craftsperson, and that the particular craft that they are \u2013 that they\u2019ve pursued, and that they\u2019ve done their \u2013 they become a master in, it\u2019s usually just their aptitude, and it\u2019s a very common type of person, which is also really useful, because therefore some crafts exist for a moment, and then they don\u2019t exist anymore, they\u2019re no longer needed.\nLike the blacksmith has finally figured out what to do next. And so I think that\u2019s \u2013 like all of this is actually really worth sort of understanding, and because \u2013 you know, like I sometimes talk to, you know, junior engineers who describe themselves as, \"I\u2019m a React front-end developer,\" and like, \"Wow, you just put two little bits into your identity, but you really don\u2019t need to, because \u2013 like I think you\u2019re actually much more than that because you can solve problems extremely well.\"\nThe rallying cry is like, people who were able to make the things that they really want with what they\u2019ve got, like that\u2019s sort of at the core of it, and I love that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, our last guest of the year is really looking towards the future. David Kirtley and his company, Helion, are working to build the world\u2019s first nuclear fusion power plant, which, as the words come out of my mouth, sounds incredibly audacious. But if you really think about the biggest challenges facing us as a species, having access to not just a clean energy supply, but abundance of energy, like, where we can have way more power than we have now available to us to help us to, you know, fulfill and achieve our biggest ambitions, is super, super important. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I completely agree. And I have to say, you know, audacious or not, and I think audacious is a great word for it, listening to you and David talk got me so excited about what the potential in the future could be, if these things can come to fruition. So, let\u2019s close out now with your conversation with David.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But, like, I think the thing that people really miss, and, like, you probably have a better perspective on this than I do, is that starting somewhere in the 1970s, like, we just stopped using energy at the rate that we had been using it before. And \u2013 and, like, it\u2019s actually a staggering thing to think about, you know, not \u2013 not just, like, what happens if we can take the energy that we\u2019re consuming right now, and it\u2019s like, more sustainable.  \n \nBut, like, what happens if, like, energy becomes sustainable, and cheap and abundant enough where you could use 100 times more, 1,000 times more or 10,000 times more of it than you\u2019re using right now? What\u2019s the impossible? So, like, talk \u2013 talk a little bit about, like, why \u2013 why energy matters? \n \nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah, I think about this a lot, actually, and from two perspectives. One is just recently, we\u2019re starting to use more electricity. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re up ticking, for the first time in a long time, where in the 1970s and \u201880s, we plateaued in a lot of ways, in terms of our energy use. I think that\u2019s totally right.  \n \nBut recently, electric transportation, probably computation and AI kicks into that, too, and then \u2013 and looking at ways to solve climate change by spending electricity then goes in, and it\u2019s starting to increase our \u2013 our demand for electricity. \n \nAnd the other thing I tie to in this is that the \u2013 for instance, the other thing I tie to in this is standard of living directly ties with access to electricity, low-cost electricity. So, you look at different parts of the world and standard of living, and you can say, like, okay, great, they have more electricity access. They have more standard of living, however you want to define that. But I asked the same question, what happens if we had 10 times? Does that mean our standard of living would be 10 times? What does that mean? Would we have access to cleaner access to clean water.  \n \nDesalination is the classic. There\u2019s a \u2013 there\u2019s a trigger at the one to two cent per kilowatt hour, where if you can have electricity at that cost, then now you can desalinate water through electrolysis and other methods directly. Clean water is now cheaper than it was to actually, like, pull it out of a river and purify it. And so, suddenly, you know, you enable some of those things, which are clear.  \n \nBut I think through, you know, if you had, you know, the computational access, where you can have large scale servers at \u2013 at everybody\u2019s house, you\u2019ve got to get the \u2013 maybe the server price down. But now you can actually do really interesting things on the computation and the cooling around that. \n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Look, I think one of the things that maybe people don\u2019t appreciate or think about clearly enough, is maybe everything good that has ever happened in the history of humankind is humans discovering new sources of energy, and being able to put that energy to work solving problems that benefit humans.  \n \nAnd so, in a sense, like, you actually want to be able to consume more energy. You don\u2019t want the consumption of energy to be a bad thing, because nominally consuming more energy means you\u2019re doing more of those useful things for humanity, you know, like, electrolysis. \n \nLike, I mean, one of the things here in the state of California is, like, we have parts of the state where you have abundant water, and you have parts of the state where you have no water. And, like, one of the reasons that California is habitable is we spend an enormous amount of energy pumping water from places where it\u2019s abundant to places where it\u2019s scarce. And, like, I think you\u2019re going to have to do more of that in the future with climate change.  \n \nSo, you know, you really do want a world where you have cheap, abundant energy, which is why I think the problem you\u2019re working on is \u2013 like, I think artificial intelligence is a pretty important problem. That\u2019s the thing I spend most of my time working on. But I think your problem is more important than my problem, and my problem is dependent on your problem. (Laughter.)  \n \nDAVID KIRTLEY: Yeah, at some scale, your problem \u2013 our two problems work together. Yeah, I \u2013 I don\u2019t know that we know, frankly, what happens if you have more energy, more low-cost electricity, particularly ones \u2013 it has to be low cost. That\u2019s really important. If it just costs a lot more and you have more of it, it doesn\u2019t actually help \u2013 help the situation where the essentially effective cost of burning wood to burning coal to fission power, and then to renewables that are \u2013 some of the renewables when you have access to good sunlight, solar power can be really low cost, does \u2013 you have these stage gates for humanity that you unlock. \n  \nI don\u2019t know that we know the answer to that, but I\u2019m excited to find out. That\u2019s for sure.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: That was a whirlwind tour of our incredible 2023 guests on Behind The Tech this year.
