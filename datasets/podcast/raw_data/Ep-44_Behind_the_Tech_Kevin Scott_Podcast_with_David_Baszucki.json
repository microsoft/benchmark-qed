{"episode": "Ep-44 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with David Baszucki", "text": "DAVID BASZUCKI: Time and time again, I think we try to solve things or figure them out ourselves rather than take a step back and think through, could the community do this better than us if we gave them the tools and the functionality?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we\u2019re going to get behind the tech. We\u2019ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what\u2019s happening today. Stick around.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello and welcome back to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Christina Warren, senior developer advocate at GitHub.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And this is actually like one of our first video episodes. So if \u2013 if you want to give us a watch, I guess, you can follow us on YouTube. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Excellent. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, it\u2019s good stuff. \n\nOkay. So we\u2019re super excited today because our guest this week is David Baszucki, who is the co-founder and the CEO of Roblox, which is a game creation platform that allows users to build their own games. And it has over 50 million users, which is just stunning to think about. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It is, it\u2019s a stunning number of daily active users on that platform. And, you know, two of the daily active users are my kids, who at 11 and 13 have been Roblox enthusiasts for a while. And it was \u2013 you know, honestly it was through my kids that I really got to an understanding of how big a platform Roblox was and the sort of impact it was having in the world. So I feel really lucky to be able to chat with David today and I\u2019m going to be a hero to my kids whenever this show airs. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, no, I was going to say I was like, you now get to go back to your kids and say, \u201cI just talked to the head of Roblox,\u201d and they\u2019re gonna be like, \u201cOh my God.\u201d Like that\u2019s \u2013 like all the other very important and famous people that you talk to all the time, it\u2019s like, nah, not a big deal, but you\u2019re like, I know the Roblox guy. All of a sudden, hero. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, 100%. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right. Well, let\u2019s now get into Kevin\u2019s conversation with David. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: David Baszucki is an entrepreneur, engineer, and inventor. He\u2019s the founder and CEO of Roblox, an online game creation platform that allows users to design their own games and play different kinds of games created by others. Roblox has helped millions of up-and-coming game developers learn the basics of their domain and work on their talents. \n\nWelcome to the show, David. \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Kevin, it\u2019s a real pleasure to be here. Thank you for having me on the podcast. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And thanks for being here, too. You and I have chatted about this before, but my kids are going to think I\u2019m a superhero for having you on the show. They spend more time in Roblox than probably any other piece of software that they use. \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Well, that\u2019s awesome. I think they should think you\u2019re a superhero because you design and build incredible infrastructure and think about technical things. So that\u2019s really why you\u2019re a superhero. \n\nBut, hey, it\u2019s great to hear that, and yeah, we like to think when parents share that their kids are spending a lot of time in Roblox, we like to think that\u2019s a lot like the time they might spend on the phone with their friends or the time they might spend creating a level in Dungeons and Dragons with their friend or spending time playing hide and go seek when they can\u2019t play it outside. So we\u2019re actually not always trying to optimize that engagement time, but we do want that engagement time to be socially connected. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think that\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s an interesting, interesting thing. My wife and I had, for a very long while, been really sensitive to the amount of screen time that our kids were getting. And then, you know, we had this epiphany during the pandemic that Roblox was actually one of the places where our kids were able to get the socialization that they weren\u2019t getting because of all of the lockdown stuff that was going on. So they would jump into Roblox and play with their friends. It was their digital playground, so to speak, and they\u2019d be on, you know, Facetime on the side and like having a conversation. And like in a certain sense it was life-saving. I don\u2019t know what they would have done to have maintained all of that social connectivity if they hadn\u2019t had Roblox. \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Hey, that\u2019s cool to hear and that aligns a bit with our thinking about this type of technology as a utility that can host co-experience and connection, like the telephone system, like what we do in real life, even like the U.S. mail system at time. \n\nAnd I think when we talk about social networking technology and social technology, I don\u2019t think a lot of \u2013 you know, there\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of nuance on it. Some social networking technology is more about sharing images or sharing video or consuming things statically. And then what\u2019s cool about Roblox, I think is it\u2019s much more of a real time communication connection type technology, and inherently real time connection technology I think feels different than, you know, solo consumption type technology. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, for sure. \n\nSo you know, before we get into like all of the many interesting things that we can chat about, about Roblox, I\u2019d love to just back up a little bit and ask you what I ask everyone who comes on the podcast, which is, you know, what was your life like growing up and how did you get interested in technology? \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Yeah, I had a bit of a wonderful life growing up in the far out suburbs of Minneapolis, where we had sand pits and dirt bikes and, you know, things to build and go-karts and a lot of stuff to do. \n\nBut as part of that fun building thing, early on in my younger years, our school had a computer lab. The computer lab was a teletype with a paper tape. And we got to \u2013 I remember writing my first BASIC program, which was trying to sort five numbers and storing my work on paper tape. \n\nThen my dad got us all an Apple II and as I was programing this Apple II and reading the manuals and it was the time when you had, you know, all these Apple II magazines were out and you\u2019d enter this stuff, for some reason that Apple II had an assembler and a disassembler built into it. And there\u2019s just something fun about, okay, my visual, my BASIC program\u2019s running slow, but there\u2019s this assembler thing. \n\nAnd the Apple IIs also had this wonderful facility where you could hook up some potentiometers from RadioShack to the analog inputs and start getting those. So that combination, I think, got me interested in this and kind of that was the germination really. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And I mean, our technology that we have today is certainly amazing, but I do think this thing that you just mentioned, which is the fact that these early machines were so approachably programable, like when you \u2013 I just remember walking up to something like a Commodore 64 in a department store, for instance, and you would be sitting there at a BASIC command prompt. And so, like, the thing is inviting you to type code into it as your first interaction that you\u2019re having, which is sort of amazing. \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Yeah. It\u2019s almost as if the user interface in the days was the command prompt and the user interface was entering code almost, which is it\u2019s a lot harder to find a command prompt now on a modern day computer.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it indeed it is. \n\nSo did you have anyone around you when you were a kid? So you had this computer lab at school, but did you \u2013 was it mostly learning from these magazines and sort of teaching yourself? \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Yeah. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Or did you have anyone around you? \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: It was very self-learned, for some reason. There was a very rich up-and-coming PC ecosystem, a lot of magazines to read, to follow. I was a little bit of a \u2013 I remember we had a computer lab and I would make programs to make all the computers in the computer lab do funny things or, you know, try to play around with the people who are running the computer lab. But no, I was pretty autonomous. When I went out to university, you know, there\u2019s a little bit more of that, but a lot, definitely a lot of personal self-discovery back in those days. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And \u2013 and was gaming or writing games one of the early things that captured your imagination with computers \u2013\n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 or did that come later? \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: No. I remember writing, you know, an assembler with the very primitive shape rotation graphics the Apple II had, you know, versions of Asteroids and things like that, just to see what it felt like. \n\nAnd there was one game on the Apple II, it was called Robot War, that had a very simple programing language. And you\u2019d program your robots and they would go do battle. And I remember my brother and I just spent hours and hours on that. So there was an interest \u2013 there\u2019s kind of an intersection of gaming, programing, user-generated content that was all interesting to me. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Super cool. And how did you get from Minneapolis to Stanford? \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Yeah. Pretty naively, reading magazines and what\u2019s a good school for computer science kids. Where I was growing up, we didn\u2019t really know. And it was Stanford and MIT, and luckily it was Stanford. My dad took me out. We visited and it\u2019s an amazing campus. So it was a fairly non-sophisticated trajectory. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so you\u2019re at Stanford. I\u2019m guessing you and I are about the same age. So it was probably like a very interesting time to be at Stanford. And so when you graduated, there was probably like all of this super cool stuff going on. You know, the Internet boom was, I\u2019m guessing, about to happen when you graduated, not quite there, but about. So how did you decide what to go work on after you graduated? \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Yeah, I was pretty \u2013 when I graduated, I was pretty shy and pretty unsophisticated. And knowing what I know now, you know, there were all these companies I really would have liked: Microsoft, Apple. They were all coming along. But I was very much going through the standard channels and the college campus recruiting center and all of that stuff. So I ended up getting a couple, I would say, much less optimal jobs, where I wasn\u2019t \u2013 like I wasn\u2019t getting to build interesting stuff and things like that. So my first two jobs were actually a real disaster, and I thought, \u201cOh my gosh, like, what am I going to do?\u201d \n\nThe things that finally started happening for me when I took some time off after two, two and a half years, and just started writing Macintosh educational software. And that\u2019s \u2013 that was kind of, I had to invent it on my own. \n\nIf I was more sophisticated, I would have gone and camped out at Microsoft or Apple and just said, \u201cYou must hire me,\u201d tried to meet all of those people, but I wasn\u2019t. So I resorted to building this first version of Interactive Physics, and that\u2019s what kind of got me back into the stuff I really like. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, so tell us a little bit about that. So this is, you know, both you doing something interesting programming-wise, but you\u2019re starting a business, too. And so like those are two very, very interesting things. \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Yeah, it was driven a lot by the love of constructive software. And in those days, in the mid- to late \u201880s, educational software was very early HyperCard-y, templatized, pre-canned, slider type stuff. \n\nAnd I was looking at the whole educational software market, and it\u2019s interesting when you\u2019re on the outside of something, it seems like it must be awesome and great. But then when you go and start playing with it yourselves, the ideas start flowing. And I say, \u201cOh my gosh, this is all pre-canned.\u201d What would \u2013 wouldn\u2019t it be cool if there is a way to build all of these things and try anything and build physics experiments? \n\nSo that launched the idea of Interactive Physics. It was kind of a business, but I got to tell you, educational software is a hard business and \u2013 but I went down the path anyways. I remember meeting with a friend of my dad\u2019s, who was very sophisticated, and he said, \u201cLook, I think the overall size of this whole market is X,\u201d and it was a very small market. And I kind of said to myself, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible, it can\u2019t be that small.\u201d But yes, it did turn out to be exactly that size about four or five years later. \n\nBut nonetheless, yeah, we went and I did a lot of research on physics simulation. Back then, this was very early, you know, SIGGRAPH type stuff, 2D, simulation, was able to put together this physics simulator and build this thing that was called Interactive Physics, and it was really exciting. All the physics textbooks correlated to it. A lot of teachers around the \u2013 got to be millions and millions of students. So it was a great launching. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And so, it \u2013 I just sort of wonder, like, you know, again, you\u2019ve got two things here at least that you\u2019re doing, that at least on the surface sound like they\u2019d be relevant to the founding of Roblox. So like physics is an important thing for videogames and then just whatever lessons you learned, you know, of succeeding or failing at business is sort of a great workshop for starting your next business. \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: That\u2019s right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So was that actually the case? \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Yeah, we with Interactive Physics and the company was called Knowledge Revolution, we made what I\u2019d call a third mistake, which was rather than thinking about our end users, who we loved, and the market and consumer, we said, \u201cLet\u2019s take this physics engine and make it into something that mechanical engineers are going to use,\u201d which was a little more logical. They\u2019re a great market, too, but once again, not a huge market. And it takes a lot more technology and a lot less consumer polish for those types of products. \n\nThat, we finally were acquired by a company that makes mechanical engineering software and I worked there for a few years, but the notion was always come back to consumer and there was a notion that the best educational tools sometimes aren\u2019t educational tools. They\u2019re a really good word processor. They\u2019re a really good movie editor. They\u2019re a really good web browser. And that those types of things can go super high quality, super high volume, and be educational tools that tens of millions of people will use. \n\nSo the learning from Interactive Physics was, let\u2019s think about going more consumer, let\u2019s go 3D instead of 2D, let\u2019s go multiplayer, let\u2019s go cloud-based, let\u2019s go avatar-based, so rather than a 2D experiment that you\u2019re watching by yourself, you\u2019re inside of a 3D experiment with your friends, you know, around the world on multiple devices.\n\nSo that Interactive Physics thought was still there, but the hope was if there\u2019s thousands of engineers working on super high quality, free consumer software, the byproduct of that may be an educational product that\u2019s even better than Interactive Physics. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so you started Roblox in 2006, right? So what was it like at the beginning? So in 2006, just to remind folks like it, you know, on the one hand, at 16 years ago, it seems like a long while. On the other, like maybe not long at all. But in \u201806, there was no iPhone, no iPad, you know, just for instance. \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: That\u2019s right. We actually started writing code in 2003. \n\nOne thing that was there was Visual Studio, so cha-ching, really nice. And so, we started writing on Visual Studio on Windows. It was very early on. It was the days when Flash was big, when anything interactive has to be in Flash or no one\u2019s going to ever install it. It was before the \u2013 you know, we took the controversial notion, no, we want an executable, we want the performance, all of that stuff. It was, you know, 3D graphics was somewhat standardized with DirectX and OpenGL. It was early on. \n\nBut at the same time, in the midst of all of this metaverse chat and discussion, even in 2005 and \u201806, we saw There.com and Second Life coming out. So, you know, it\u2019s a little highlight that these ideas have been around for a long time. \n\nDefinitely no iPhone, definitely PC-based only, but a lot of the visions that we had, new category, immersive 3D co-experience, elements of gaming, social networking, toys, media, yes, yes, yes. Has to be cloud-based. Yes, yes, yes. Those core pieces were all there. \n\nThe early days were Erik and myself writing code in Menlo Park for about a year and a half or, you know, to get the first version of this thing going and doing a lot of the key stuff we have in Roblox now, some of that had that origin, you know, Roblox Studio, the cloud, all of that. We were one of the first S3 customers. So yeah, a lot of fun stories going back there. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So what were some of the like big challenges just starting that business that you all faced?\n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: So one challenge was this was, you know, we didn\u2019t know anything about the gaming or consumer space. We \u2013 and I think that was good in a way. We were thinking way out of the box and not taking anything for granted. We were comfortable having our product function well, even if it didn\u2019t look well. We were big fans of Craigslist because it was very simple and minimalist and high performance. And so, we\u2019re very function based.\n\nI think we picked up tidbits along the way. One was we learned to experiment from ground zero. We would buy very small amounts of AdWords traffic. We\u2019d buy 100 users for $100, and we could kind of see them come on the platform and in \u2013 you know, it\u2019s an interesting mathematical exercise, but you could probably prove that every Roblox player today has a word of mouth history going all the way back to some original thousand AdWords people that we bought that were like in some Darwinian evolutionary the chokepoint to the foundation of Roblox. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s interesting.\n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Yeah. So we would buy a few of these users. Then we started to see the virality. We would hang out with them. \n\nThe challenges I think were always around having to build a viral platform. We never \u2013 buying traffic was always way too expensive to scale a business like this. So it had to be socially viral. \n\nI think some of the challenges we learned along the way, in those days, there were a lot of, quote, you know, \u201cWeb 1.0 viral techniques\u201d of pushing links and doing this and, you know, getting people to check in and all of that. And we got distracted a bit by that because in the end, just true word of mouth, just come here to be with your friend was more powerful than a lot of those things.\n\nAnd then I\u2019d say a lot of learning along the way, right off the bat on safety and civility. Because we were in there with everyone on the platform, we knew within probably the first three weeks of launching Roblox, oh my gosh, like, we got to get all over this. \n\nAnd my partner, to his credence, Erik, said, \u201cNo, like we have to build the first moderation safety system right now\u201d and that was a really good learning. We actually when there were four of us in the company, we were on a daily rotation where the four of us were running the moderation and safety queue and, you know, kind of getting a feel for this before we hired other people. So that learning came very early.\n\nAnd some other really good learnings we had early on, one of the learnings was very early on, back then there was this thing called forums which, you know, that\u2019s very 19 \u2013 you know, early 2000s kind of stuff. We would \u2013 besides interacting with all the players, we\u2019d interact on the forums. \n\nAnd what was really a good learning was anything we did, half the people on the forums were going to quit Roblox. You know, I don\u2019t care how good it was or how creative it was, when we added better animation, when we added clothing, there was just so much passion around the community, that anything, any enhancements from the retro original Roblox was like a big deal. So that was also good learning, to kind of balance the community.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, like I\u2019m curious about that in particular. So, you know, obviously when you\u2019re making an improvement or enhancement to the product and like half of the people are threatening to quit or are actually quitting, like if that happens monotonically, you go to zero. So you obviously \u2013\n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: They never quit. They never quit. (Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, and I\u2019m guessing that a bunch of these enhancements are like things that drove growth, right? \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: That\u2019s \u2013 yes, they were always things that drove growth. It kind of highlighted the passion of the community and how much people wanted to be involved with that. \n\nAnd that, I think, also taught us to respect the community and to start, you know, coming together with them, holding developer conferences, all of that. And we ended up with a really good balance where we have to drive part of the product with our own vision, and at the same time, we have to be listening to the community continuously, dev relations all over the place, because they\u2019re very early warning thing around places where we may be going astray. So it\u2019s a great balance. We have an amazing, passionate community and it has evolved into an amazing creator developer community as well. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, so that\u2019s a good segue into the next thing I wanted to chat about.  The thing that I didn\u2019t understand about Roblox when I was first watching my kids play it is I didn\u2019t understand that Roblox was a platform for creating games. I thought it was a game. \n\nAnd so I would see my kids. I\u2019d ask them, \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing?\u201d \u201cOh, we\u2019re playing, you know, X or Y or Z.\u201d And I would watch them and I was like, \u201cOh, this looks like Roblox.\u201d And like, what \u2013 what made you all decide that the thing to do here was to create this platform versus like making a single game with a big, expansive world? \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: I think Erik and I inherently didn\u2019t see ourselves as content creator capable. It\u2019s almost like we had a bunch of ideas for things, but we trusted more our ability to build the technology and platform than those things themselves. \n\nAnd I think we also loved the combinatorial possibility of building tools that if we were to build them right \u2013 it\u2019s interesting, right? If we\u2019re going to build this open-ended tool in Roblox Studio and a platform, it\u2019s\u2013 there\u2019s a such a wide range of what might happen. No one might use it. Okay, boom. Or many people might build stuff we\u2019ve never seen before and we could never imagine. And so that variability of outcome and that risk was exciting to us. \n\nAnd when we \u2013 I remember launching \u2013 when we launched Roblox, we at times would have 6 to 20 people online using an experience that we had built as a prototype place. It was called Crossroads. And we were not in any way viral. We knew we wanted to launch a Roblox Studio and see what other people would build, and so it was a bit scary. Okay, we\u2019re going to launch Roblox Studio. If they don\u2019t build really good stuff, like we\u2019re not going to be viral, this isn\u2019t going to go anywhere, but there\u2019s a chance they\u2019re going to build really interesting stuff. So let\u2019s see what happens. \n\nSo the day we launched Roblox Studio, it\u2019s kind of those days you remember in your company where, oh my gosh, five creations, 10, 20. This one\u2019s pretty interesting. Oh my gosh, I can\u2019t believe that. And so, you know, we knew that that bet had paid off. It is really good learning. Time and time again, I think we try to solve things or figure them out ourselves rather than take a step back and think through, could the community do this better than us if we gave them the tools and the functionality? And there\u2019s been many things we\u2019ve started doing that we stopped and tried to push back to the community from that learning. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, that\u2019s sort of an amazing perspective to have. And I think one of the really nice things about your platform is that you sort of have the interest of all of the parties aligned. So if you don\u2019t have great content creators building on your platform, then the platform itself, you know, declines in utility to your users. And if the content creators can\u2019t come to your platform and get a bunch of, you know, engaged, happy, excited users playing there or interacting with their content, then, you know, like they\u2019re not going to come to your platform anymore. So are there other things other than this, you know, humility about what you\u2019re great at versus what you\u2019re going to trust the content creators to be great at philosophically that you have thought about in terms of nurturing this platform? \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: I think the other one is, you know, we have a few key values. One is respecting the community and trusting the community. The other is taking the long view on this. And that goes hand in hand because whether it\u2019s Pixar or Roblox or, you know, Disney in the early days or whatever, time and time again, we get confronted with places we need to move the technology where there\u2019s decisions around very obvious short-term things that might be a little more tactical. And then looming out there, there is sometimes, whoa, that\u2019s really hard. That could take us a year or two. \n\nWe at least want to talk about it like, whoa, well, how hard is it? Could today\u2019s computer bandwidth, GPU, CPU maybe do that? Okay. If that really hard thing worked, though, in three or four years, would we be better off or not? Oh, yeah, we might actually be better off with that really hard thing than this stack of more obvious things. Oh, my gosh, but then we may have to, you know, may be a year or two out. \nSo I think trying to confront those things time and time again is super critical. And it\u2019s super difficult to teach and learn from each other when to confront those things. But I think we\u2019ve had several examples of those. \n\nAnd I think trying to create a culture that does that, which is kind of what you might call a culture of innovation, is very, very hard, very difficult, but I think it\u2019s a key component of the future value of any company. Like, how much can we be inventing stuff? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, look, I think for any of the listeners who have ever worked at a technology company or like been a leader in a technology company, they will understand the deep truth in what you just said. And for everybody else, like I just can\u2019t even address how hard a problem this is. \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Because there are like all sorts of things. You know, we \u2013 sometimes we call it Innovator\u2019s Dilemma. You know, sometimes it\u2019s momentum, sometimes. But there\u2019s so many things that are trying to drag you into the short term when, I mean, we just sort of know it\u2019s almost axiomatic that, you know, innovation is doing something different than what you\u2019re doing right now. And like, we know that innovation is the thing that creates all of the interesting value in the world. So doing that well is just tough, man. \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: It\u2019s so tough. It\u2019s a lot of the reason why small companies with three to six people, who have had the leisure of, okay, let\u2019s take six months off, let\u2019s try this crazy thing, I mean, that six months off of hanging with your three or six other people is a place where deep innovation can happen, you know, where anything is possible. \n\nAnd trying to make sure inside of a company with 2,000 people, trying to figure out how to have that happen as well through the feedback loops, how we review teams, whether teams feel comfortable proposing those long-term things is really interesting. \n\nOne of the principles we\u2019ve kind of come across is, is it possible to both have that really long pull thing, which is going to be really hard, but break it down into small steps where you can actually build it, you know, in a hundred small pieces rather than drop shipping something two years out. And so, when those are possible, that makes things a lot more fun because at least you can see the progress to the big thing. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, I mean, another interesting thing that you all must feel is we live, at least in Silicon Valley, in an eco \u2013 and increasingly, I think this is like everywhere, we live in an ecosystem where if you\u2019re really entrepreneurial and like really determined to get something done and you\u2019re working for a company that won\u2019t let you do the interesting, hard things, you just sort of quit, go raise some money, and build the thing yourself. And \u2013 but those are exactly the people that you want helping you find the next version of your company. And so, building an environment for them where they can do that hard, ambitious work, you know, for Roblox or for Microsoft or you know, for whomever their employer is, is like just so important. \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Yeah. A really optimistic way of looking at it might be by doing the work to focus on innovation because we believe it\u2019s so important, hopefully it actually makes it a more retentive place for extremely creative, innovative people. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Right. And how do you get people to focus? Because, I mean, one of the things with innovation, you\u2019ve sort of seen this in the crucible of being a startup, is not every hard thing that you can do is a useful, hard thing.\n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: That\u2019s right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so there has to be some editing process or something in the ecosystem that helps you sort of say, okay, well, I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m getting signal here like, you know, this thing is good and this thing, not so much. \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: I think one thing to look for here is really hard things, when looked at from afar, even as a design document, I think tend to have some kind of a closed loop feedback system where you look at all the components of the really hard thing, and it\u2019s not just hard for the sake of being hard. You can see like, if these hard things work together and we make sure we have all the pieces, we\u2019re going to get a feedback loop. There\u2019s either going to be more user-generated content or we\u2019re going to see an economy that\u2019s self-sustaining or the platforms are going to get safer, like and can see how that\u2019s going to feed upon itself. \n\nThere\u2019s other things I sometimes see that are very hard, but they\u2019re almost like they go off and they don\u2019t close the loop. It\u2019s just like, oh, like this is amazing and it\u2019s hard and it\u2019s really cool. But does it end up being part of a system where something good is going to happen? And I think thinking in advance of the closed loop where this thing is going to grow upon itself, that\u2019s one of the signals we try to look for in these things. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, so, you know, as we\u2019re talking about innovation now, I\u2019d love to get your take on the metaverse. And like I have this definition of the metaverse, which is a metaverse is a fully immersive environment that lets you connect with other people to express the fullness of your identity and to accomplish your creative endeavors. \n\nAnd so, if I say that definition and I look at Roblox, like Roblox feels to me like a metaverse. Like I \u2013 even though it\u2019s a 2D screen, you don\u2019t have to put anything on your head. You know, like I \u2013 there aren\u2019t many things more immersive than Roblox for my 11 year old, for instance. \nDAVID BASZUCKI: I think that\u2019s very close with what socially the definition\u2019s going to emerge to. I like to think of it as an inexorable category following along mail, telegraph, telephone, video call, simulated 3D immersive communication. Definitely about identity, definitely about friends and connection and a social graph. \n\nDefinitely about immersiveness and that that immersiveness isn\u2019t just pure 3D fidelity. It\u2019s functional fidelity. It\u2019s social fidelity. It\u2019s device by device, going from phone all the way to immersive VR. I think it\u2019s typically, I think it will more and more be about an infinite array of places and content and objects as part of that. I think these are evolving to always get into economic aspects. \n\nAnd then I think metaverses will have various levels of safety and civility. Just like places on the web, we\u2019re leaning in really hard on a civilized place for people together. \n\nAnd I think it\u2019s still so fun and so early, that every company is still trying to figure out their own view of this. Like, it\u2019s fun because it\u2019s still emerging. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, so thinking about this stuff as an engineer for an instance, for an instant, there are a bunch of components that I think any metaverse is going to have to have. So there\u2019s, you know, some way for you to richly express your identity. There\u2019s some way to do commerce with other people in the metaverse. Like there\u2019s some, you know, some value store that you\u2019re going to have to have. There\u2019s some way to, you know, like, here\u2019s what property means in this metaverse. So have you all thought about what those things are? Because again, I think you have a whole bunch of them. \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Yeah, this is really interesting. And it\u2019s funny because, you know, if we were building cars 60 years ago, this would be some biz school make versus buy discussion and what do you have to make and what can you buy and all of that stuff. \n\nSome of these components aren\u2019t yet invented and that makes it really exciting. So the components that might allow us to go together to a 50,000 person, photorealistic concert, with great audio and hang out and dance and wave across the stadium at everyone else and have them wave back, that\u2019s a long ways off. \n\nSo I like the notion that it\u2019s still early and there\u2019s a lot of deep tech that needs to be invented to support this, as well as a lot of proven tech, whether it\u2019s the economy, is it running on blockchain or a database identity. What\u2019s the graphics drivers and all the machines? How do we do a social graph, all of that? It\u2019s an interesting mix of some technologies that are mature and some that are a long ways off and being actively invented.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So one of the interesting and like things that\u2019s way more complicated than I think most people would recognize is like you having your own financial infrastructure. So you all have \u2013 have this currency called Robux. That\u2019s a thing that players have. You can spend them across all of the games that are happening. Like they, you know, they let you purchase entitlements, you know, inside all of these games. \n\nYou know, my best friend used to run product and engineering at Linden Lab and so like they had their own currency. \n\nSo and it is complicated, right? Like having your own economy is an interesting thing. Especially you guys are, what, 50 million daily active users. Like that is bigger than some countries, right? \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: That\u2019s right. Well, it\u2019s complicated in many dimensions. It\u2019s complicated in a reliability, anti-theft, anti-hack, SarBox compliant, SEC way, in that it just has to be run at a certain level of rigor and reliability and fraud detection and all of that. \n\nIt\u2019s contemplated from a infra scaling standpoint, which, you know, many companies do really well, but that still we shouldn\u2019t take that for granted. \n\nIt\u2019s also, I think, complicated looking to the future where more and more, if we can see things happening in real life, we\u2019re going to see them in digital life. And we\u2019re still very early on this as far as advertising, as far as shopping, as far as collectibles, as far as a lot of other economic things that we\u2019re used to, that have digital equivalents. So there\u2019s a lot of complexity going forward in designing elegant systems that work well in the digital domain that we\u2019re very used to in our real world life. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And you know, one of the interesting things about these metaverses is I \u2013 and you \u2013 you don\u2019t have to offer an opinion here if you don\u2019t want to, is like I don\u2019t really understand or have an opinion about how things are going to net out, whether you\u2019re going to have closed economies inside of each metaverse, or whether you\u2019re going to have some kind of horizontal, like economic mechanism where you can sort of like have a thing that\u2019s in Roblox and there\u2019s a way to exchange for those things in other metaverses.\n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Yeah, I think this dovetails into all kinds of open versus closed discussions, and the analogy I make sometimes is today, we\u2019re not talking AOL or CompuServe. Today, we\u2019re talking a dial-up bulletin board with a 300 baud modem. That\u2019s how early we are in the tech for these things. \n\nAnd there\u2019s going to be multiple stages, including the AOL, CompuServe stage, Prodigy stage, till finally we do get open standards, and there will ultimately be metaverse LAMP stacks and there\u2019ll be metaverse, you know, open standards and all of that.\n\nI think what the tension is, and this was tried with VRML 15 or 20 years ago is, you know, HTML with some JavaScript has gotten us very far for 2D and a lot of people have standardized on this and it\u2019s been wonderful. \n\nThe raw fabric of 3D, multiplayer, photorealistic simulation, including a cloud across many devices around the world, it\u2019s just such a big technical problem to solve, that I think it\u2019s going to be how do we solve this on the way to open standards, and solving this may be 10 or 20 years. So, you know, it\u2019s just very early and I can\u2019t predict when the full openness of these standards starts to arise. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and I think you\u2019re totally right. I mean, the most interesting standards that we use right now to run the internet co-evolved with product. It wasn\u2019t that they like came out in whole cloth and then we built everything on top of them. They sort of come along with each other. And I do think you\u2019re right, we do feel pretty early to even have the idea that we\u2019re going to go standardize all of this stuff. \n\nBut I tell you, I have been interested over the past couple of years with, you know, what people are doing with NFTs and like what, you know, property can look like in the digital domain, like how you go from a thing that had zero marginal reproduction cost and like you can still figure out how to make it scarce and rare and, you know, collectible and, you know, like a thing that, you know, a set of social contracts give value, you know, not that it\u2019s like physically rare.\n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Yeah, I think this is a huge opportunity and we\u2019re seeing the natural evolution that in the digital domain, just as we have things of value in our physical world, it makes no sense that some of these things have so much value. Rare items, collectible items, nostalgic items, tradable items, they do have value besides the value of them as food or shelter. I mean, there is extra value there. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yep.\n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: And so, I think when people see this in the digital domain, sometimes they go, \u201cOh my gosh, that makes sense\u201d and they lose track of the fact that in the real world, we already have had this forever. \n\nSo for us, it\u2019s a really interesting opportunity. There\u2019s \u2013 there are items on Roblox right now worth $20,000. You know, a Dominus Crown is very valuable. And when having that economy be resilient around that, it does logically start to open the opportunity that the trading doesn\u2019t need to be on Roblox. There could be off-platform trading of those same things. We want to have a healthy economy that\u2019s user generated with scarcity. So there is a big opportunity to make the value on Roblox liquid on and off of Roblox, which is something we\u2019re looking at. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So looking forward a bit into the future, like what are you most excited about right now? \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Wow. We have, you know, some projects we\u2019ve shared and then some that we haven\u2019t that are all about keeping trying to innovate, really. I love some of the stuff we\u2019ve shared. You know, we want everyone\u2019s avatar to be fully UGC. People lose track of the fact that Roblox has gotten pretty far with a lot of the avatar tech still being controlled by us, unlike the 3D experience tech. So I think that\u2019s just going to be very exciting when our creator community has full control of bodies, heads, faces, all the clothing, all of that, really excited.\n\nOur behind the scenes, you know, our core engine team and developer tooling team, we just have started shipping more and more technology where the Roblox cloud backend is accessible not just through Roblox studio, but just through any kind of web API with auth. \n\nAnd so, an example we would like to get to is, you know, the data in your place or the persistent data, our devs can build their own tools to access it rather than using Roblox studios. \n\nSo we just \u2013 I was just this reading about this yesterday. All of the key value stores that our developers use in their experiences, they can access programmatically now. They can start building stuff on top of that rather than just through studios. So super fun stuff there. \n\nI think we\u2019re really getting into how do we do voice in a safe and civilized way because it\u2019s ultimately a big part of what we\u2019re going to do. Syncing facial animation, either automatically with the camera, with lip synching, is going to bring a next level of life to these platforms, as long as it\u2019s once again done in a safe and secure way. So that\u2019s, super interested about that. \n\nInterested in ROS scale. Interested in our internal version of Lua, which is Typed. We\u2019ve open source that. And so we\u2019re interested in efforts to have people use that in education, and nudge, nudge, of course, help our developers be very productive in the creation of that, which is something you guys are really good at. So just a lot of fun stuff.\n\nBecause we built such a high quality Lua engine, I mean, the feature I want to see is cloud compilation of our Lua. So, you know, behind the scenes you have both the flexibility of an interpreted language, but once that thing starts running in the cloud, it\u2019s running even ten times faster. So that\u2019ll be very powerful. So just a lot of fun stuff. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, it does sound like you have a pretty special environment where you get to work on interesting problems across the full gamut of computer science, which is just a ton of fun.\n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Totally. Totally. \nKEVIN SCOTT: So we are almost out of time. And the last question that I like to ask everyone, you know, you\u2019re the CEO of a public company. Like you\u2019ve got thousands of employees, you know, tens of millions of daily active users. So you\u2019re a pretty, pretty busy guy. \n\nBut I like to ask everyone what they do in their spare time. Like, so when you\u2019re not doing Roblox, like, what do you do that is interesting to you? \n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Yeah, it\u2019s, it might sound actually really boring because the things I do when I\u2019m not at Roblox involve family, friend connections, social balance, personal health, fitness, decompression. And I\u2019d say, whereas I try to keep Roblox as the hobby I would want to do, so, you know, I try to \u2013 it\u2019s almost like I try to keep the rest of my life organized enough and happy enough and keep my head on straight enough so that I can then make Roblox kind of my hobby and my work at the same time. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That is a really great way of looking at life. \n\nWell, so thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us today. This has been a really awesome conversation, David.\n\nDAVID BASZUCKI: Thank you. Kevin. Thank you for having me. \n\n[ANIMATED TRANSITION]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right, that was Kevin\u2019s conversation with David Baszucki. And again, I mean, that was such a great conversation and so interesting to think about all the things that go into basically building, you know, what goes into building the metaverse, which is basically just kind of like building, not just like kind of an online community, but like whole world, you know? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it is sort of nuts. I mean, 50 million daily active users is bigger than a whole lot of countries. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And inside of Roblox, like you\u2019ve got some of the \u2013 or many of the same things that you would have if you had a country. There\u2019s an economy. There\u2019s identity, you know, system. Like there\u2019s just all of this creation and activity and interaction between the, you know, sort of the citizens of Roblox. And it\u2019s just it\u2019s a crazy thing to think that, you know, you\u2019ve built all of this from scratch since 2006. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, no. I mean, that was the thing that I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about as you two were talking was just the enormity of the challenge of scaling and managing something that is this large and is only getting bigger because as you say, there are all these other parts of it, right.\n\nI mean, when David was talking about just the challenges in having to have, you know, an abuse team and having to have, you know, people in place to make sure that things are running the way that they need to be running, like these are challenges that a lot of, you know, global communities face, but I think become even larger when you\u2019re talking about having a virtual world where not only do you have users interacting, but you have the users building in that world as well. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, for sure. And, you know, it\u2019s an interesting, just like you do in any sort of global community, you know, setting all of those community standards, like the, you know, the codes of conduct, the standards of civility and decency that you have. And then sort of trusting by and large that, you know, the vast majority of people on your platform are going to, you know, conform to that, but still having enough, you know, mechanism in place to protect folks from the chaotic folks or the bad actors or whatever you want to call them, who \u2013 who want to cause mischief \u2013 you know, regardless. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right. Yeah. I mean, and I have to think, too, and this was something that he touched on a little bit and certainly that you\u2019ve seen with your kids who are huge Roblox fans, but what\u2019s also interesting about this is I have to imagine the balance of having your own features and kind of your own direction, but also really leaning in and allowing the users and the community to really define what the future of the platform and of the metaverse, I guess, if we want to use that term for it looks like. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean we talked about it at some point in the conversation. It\u2019s like I think particularly what we\u2019re talking about is having the incentives aligned between, you know, the platform creator and the people who are creating on top of the platform. \n\nBut like you also have to trust one another. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like that\u2019s sort of at the core of it. You know, they have to trust that people are going to come to their platform and do things that are sort of net constructive for the community and the platform that they\u2019re trying to build. And like the people who are coming onto the platform have to trust that it\u2019s going to be, you know, safe and interesting and, you know, sort of serve all of the, like, multivariate interests that everybody has there. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, no, exactly. And I think trust is a real core word that you said. \n\nWhat also kind of got me thinking, and this goes along with that, too, is when you were discussing with him whether or not, what would it look like to maybe have, I guess, open standards between the various metaverse that exist? \n\nAnd \u2013 and I love the analogy that David used of, you know, that we\u2019re currently at the 300 baud BBS stage. We\u2019re not even at the, you know, online network stage. But I think that\u2019s an interesting thing to think about and it goes alongside, you know, the idea of a trust with users, which is, okay, we have this role here, but we recognize this isn\u2019t going to be the only world. How do we make these worlds interoperable or do we? \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, look, I think eventually we\u2019ll have to make them interoperable, right?\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Just so the same way that we learned as a world of sovereign nations, like in the physical world, we all benefit from global trade. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Right. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: You know, it\u2019s just we\u2019re a richer world when the, you know, the 8 billion-ish people on the planet can do things for one another. I think that\u2019s also going to be true in this confederation of metaverses that we\u2019re about to have.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, United Nations of metaverse or something like that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Correct. \n\nOr the, you know, global trade organization of \u2013\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Exactly.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  But, you know, it is just going to be the case that like all of these metaverses that will emerge and the people who occupy them are going to have a richer existence and be able to do more interesting things if there is some way to have, you know, trade and other sorts of interchanges between them.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Most definitely. \n\nWell, I\u2019m really glad that we have, you know, people like David who are thinking about this and steering some of the largest communities around this space.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: For sure. I think, you know, no community is perfect, right? And \u2013 but \u2013 but I think they have done a very good job of being very thoughtful about how \u2013 how they\u2019ve cultivated this community and \u2013 and how they\u2019ve dealt with some of its, you know, nastier problems. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I totally agree. I totally agree. \n\nAll right. Well, that is it for today\u2019s show. Once again, thank you very much to Roblox\u2019s David Baszucki for joining us. Fantastic. \n\nAnd if you have anything that you would like to share with us, please send us an email at BehindtheTech@Microsoft.com. \n\nAnd don\u2019t forget to follow us now on YouTube, you know, for all of your great conversations in the future.
