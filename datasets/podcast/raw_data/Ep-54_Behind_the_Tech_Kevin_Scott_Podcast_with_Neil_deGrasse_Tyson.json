{"episode": "Ep-54 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Neil deGrasse Tyson", "text": "NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: At some point you have to say \u201cmy role model is someone I have never met, and I may never meet, but I know enough about them that I want to emulate what happened in their life.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n[MUSIC]\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn this podcast, we\u2019re going to get behind the tech. We\u2019ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what\u2019s happening today. Stick around.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n[MUSIC]\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello and welcome to Behind the Tech. I'm co-host Christina Warren, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I'm Kevin Scott.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And today we have a truly, truly exciting guest with us, Neil deGrasse Tyson, who is probably the best-known astrophysicist in the world.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: for sure. I would challenge anyone to name an astrophysicist more famous than Neil. And maybe even more important than his role as an astrophysicist, like I think he's doing this unbelievably important thing that maybe has never been more important than it is right now, which is advocating for the sciences and for scientific... thinking. You know, and I would argue the reason that that is so important is the world has never been more complicated. It has never been more shaped by the forces of science and engineering. And so you know, just to be a human being in this world, like in 2023, like you really do need to like have some grasp of like what all of this complexity is about and what it means and, and, you know, having the scientific method and rationalism as a framework for helping you reason about all of this complexity, I think is one of the most like maybe the most useful tool that we have in our arsenal to just sort of move forward as a society and as individuals.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I couldn't agree more. And I'm really looking forward to this conversation because as you say, I think what he does is so important, but also like he's a fun, personable guy. And I think that's why he's so successful and why it's so great that someone like him is kind of the face of a lot of these things. I think we're very lucky to have him. So I cannot wait to check out your conversation with Neil, let's do it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n[MUSIC]\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of America's best-known astrophysicists and a beloved educator and advocate for the sciences. He has a great talent for presenting complex concepts in a clear and accessible manner. He's the head of the Hayden Planetarium and has been the director there since 1996. He's hosted numerous space-related TV and radio programs, published several books, and hosts the podcast \"StarTalk Radio.\" I am thrilled to have you on the podcast today, Neil.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Well, thank \u2013 thanks for having me. So why did it take you this long to invite me? I just want to know.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: I don't know. Shame, shame, shame on me.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: I'm not hidden, right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: You aren't. And I will say, when I started this podcast and I wrote my book and I started doing this very uncomfortable thing for me, which is trying to talk more about technology in the public, you were literally my role model. I said, you know, Neil deGrasse Tyson does such a wonderful job communicating about the importance and the value of science to the public. We don't have people doing that about software and technology-related things.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: No, you don't. That's right. Very good point. Yes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I took you as a role model, and I \u2013 granted, I'm nowhere near as charming and as effective a communicator as you are, but I'm trying to do my best.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Okay. I don't think of myself as charming. I think of \u2013 I got really good material. You know, the universe is good material. So I think the joy that people feel when they learn about the universe and take ownership of what they now understand, I think that can be confused with the messenger. And so I'm just really a conduit to the cosmos. That's how I think about it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Which, I love the humility there, but, like, I do think you also have a really special talent for taking these very complex ideas and presenting them in a very flexible way, like depending on what context you're in and to whom you're talking, in ways that people, you know, not just understand them, but are a little bit awe inspired.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI \u2013 you know, I'm sort of curious \u2013 you \u2013 I watch a bunch of YouTube videos and sort of short-form video things about comedians and you go on, you know, like with Theo Von and Joe Rogan and a bunch of these folks \u2013 like you go on their podcasts. And I watched this thing where you were on Theo Von's podcast, and you were talking to him about the combinatorics of the human genome, and it just like blew his mind and it was like a beautiful way of, you know, talking about this very complicated thing, but also just sort of the specialness of human life. Like, how do you decide who to talk to and what to talk about?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: So that's a great question; thanks for that. I have a very low bar. Let's just start there. No, it's, let me be a little more precise. When I get solicited to appear on people's shows or their podcasts, what's common in the solicitation email is they'll tell me sort of other famous people that have been on or what their following is, and on the expectation that I would really give a shit about it. I don't care who else you've had. What I care about is: Are you trying to make a difference in the world with whatever is the mission statement of your program? And if you're trying to make a difference in the world, and I can help you make a difference, I will do so.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo I got this handwritten note from some middle schoolers in a small town in Canada, and they said they started a school science podcast and they wanted to know if I'd be a guest on it. And I said sure, actually. And so it was just fun. And it was two of the kids, and they asked me about black holes and \u2013 and NASA and life in the universe, and then\u00a0 it became headlines the next day in the local paper. And I was just delighted that I could serve the cosmic curiosity in that way. And so that's just one example.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn terms of the comedians or others who have podcasts, and there's more than a million podcasts in the world that are actively produced; that's a huge number. And so, if a comedian comes to me \u2013 and I'm a huge fan of the comedic arts \u2013 in fact, on my podcast, StarTalk, my co-host is always a professional stand-up comedian. And the idea there is you are likely \u2013 based on my experience, and I think research shows this as well \u2013 you are likely to be \u2013 you're more likely to remember what you learned if you were smiling and enjoying the moment that you learned it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBecause the \u2013 is it the dopamine? I don't know. But it's some \u2013 it's some chemical emotional reaction. And then you say, \"I want to come back for more.\" And so what we've done is we've taken this sort of trinity of forces that operate on society. There's the science, there's pop culture, and there's humor. And we stitch those three together into a delivery where, while you're listening, you don't have to cross the desert to hear what I'm telling you, because I'm doing most of that gapping. I'm saying: What is going on in pop culture today? And yes, I spend a crazy amount of time, thatI'd rather just be at the beach, but I spend a lot of time familiarizing myself with pop culture.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYes, I saw \"White Lotus.\" Yes, I saw episodes of \"Succession.\" Yes, I saw episodes of \u2013 what's that show where you split your day from your work day from your home life?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. No, I know exactly what you're talking about. I forget the name.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Yeah, it's another one-word thing. Severance. Severance, right? Succession and severance. I confused them. But anyhow \u2013 so when you walk in the door, you are surrounded by a pop culture scaffold that I don't have to teach you because you already know it. By definition, that's what pop culture is. And now I look at it and I, you know, I say, all right, I got some science that could fit right there. And in that way, I'm enhancing your scientific appreciation for something you might not have even known had science in it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so when people say, oh, I like listening to \u2013 because I've done some homework there. There's nothing natural about it. I mean, I am exploring ways. I'm exploring receptors that you have \u2013 and you're different from the next person and the next person and the next person. So I walk into the room with this utility belt of tools, of educational tools and depending on who you are and what you say and what you sound like to me, that will shape what I tell you. It won't shape the substance of it, but it'll shape the framing of it, because the framing is how you end up receiving that knowledge or wisdom or insight.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd that's what I do. And it's a big effort. And like I said, I'd much rather just be in the Bahamas, but I feel like it's a duty \u2013 if I can do it, I should because I think the nation needs more of it right now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I could not agree with you more. And like, I want to dig into it a little bit, because not only is it a difficult thing, and I think building that tool kit that you've built and deciding that you want to \u2013 want to work on relatability so that you can get this message carried, like it's hard and time consuming. It's also not a thing that's necessarily appreciated in the scientific community and in the academy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI mean, so I remember like I was an academic computer scientist for a while, you know, and I have many, many, many academic researchers who work for me at Microsoft Research, and I think you're not taught, at least as a computer scientist, that a core part of your mission is to, like, broadly communicate these complicated ideas to a large audience and like even to, you know, to a certain extent, when I was an academic at the turn of the millennium...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Way back in the aughts?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Way, way back in the aughts, man \u2013 you know, even this idea that the teaching part of your job was the most important thing was rare. It was like often the research part and like the, you know, like the complexity or the interestingness of these very hard ideas were the \u2013 so I mean, it's sort of an unusual thing that a very serious scientist like you has decided to \u2013 I'll go out on a limb and say \u2013 sort of buck the culture of the scientific establishment, and choose to spend your time on what you spend your time on.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Well, that's insightful, and I would say, unfortunately true. It's that any scientist\u2019s effort to share their joy for their subject with the public, at best, is neutral. But more typically, it subtracts from your standing, because how come you're doing that and you're not in the lab? You just wrote a book for the public and you're not on that next observing run?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo yes, there is a literal and figurative cost to your progress as a competitive academic scientist. But I can tell you that, in my field, which I think was ahead of other fields in this, primarily because of folks like Carl Sagan, who was active in this way as early as the late 1960s, definitely into the 1970s. And it was \u2013 and 1980 was Cosmos, right? So he basically redefined how the public thinks about a professional scientist, not someone who's, quote, only an educator, but someone who is active on the frontier, thinking about the big questions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so I'm coming on his heels, all right? Or let me say that more pictographically. I think he cleared a field of brush and bramble \u2013 and yeah, he got chewed up a little bit in there. No, he was not warmly received by his colleagues in ways that his actual research output would have deserved. He was criticized, for example, for appearing on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, criticized \u2013 it's one thing to be on a documentary, but you're going to a comedic talk show. How dare you?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd now we look back on that and it's like, of course, he should do that. In fact, the very stereotype we have of Carl Sagan, uttering the phrase \"billions and billions,\" he never said that. You know who said that? Johnny Carson imitating. So what was happening there is this was science working its way into pop culture. And what we found in my field is the more visible Sagan was, the more responsive members of Congress were to voting budgets into place that would have more of the science that Carl Sagan was talking about. So the tidewaters lifted all boats when that was happening.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so I saw that. And to the extent that I was able \u2013 I'm on this \u2013 I'm on the field that he has cleared, and other people are there, too. By the way, I'm delighted to announce there are people with YouTube channels and Instagram things. And \u2013 and what's that other one where you do it live? Stitch, is it? Whatever. There are people, educators, scientists, not just in my field, but others wh\u2013 have given parts of their lives unto this exercise.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so I'd like to think the tidewaters are changing. In addition, something the public wouldn't have known is 15 years ago or so, the National Science Foundation and NASA, within a few years of each other, said: For this grant that you're applying for \u2013 this research grant, you have to allocate 10% or 15%. I forgot the number, but it's around there. You have to, in your proposal, describe how you're going to use that percentage of the monies for public exposure of what it is you're doing for some other good. Is it \u2013 is there a business interest that could earn money from it? Is there a school talks you can give? Is there a website you can create? And initially, that was not taken seriously.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd there are folks who had this great grant-getting record that was cut short because they didn't believe that the institutions were taking it seriously, and they have. And it's in my field. So I think other fields, physics is not quite there yet, but they see our successes, and I'd like to think that we set a model for them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it's really, really fantastic. So I want to, like...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: You mentioned Theo Von, who's a very unusual comedian, a very sort of unpretentious and very self-effacing. He...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: He \u2013 he seems disarmingly smart, so like...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Well this \u2013 well, so yes, yes. It's \u2013 the way I think of it is there are people who, I used to call them blue collar intellectuals, okay? And I don't know if Theo went to college or not, but he doesn't give off that vibe, right? Even if he did. I wrote a little bit on this. You can type \"blue collar intellectual.\" There are people who never went to college for whatever reason, okay? Couldn't afford it, didn't have the discipline, didn't \u2013 you know, too far, had to stay home, whatever. Got somebody pregnant, whatever. Okay. Yet they're eternally curious. So they would stay \u2013 and they might not even be readers, but they're watching every single Discovery Channel documentary on science, and so they stay curious their entire life.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so, I \u2013 there's a clip of me \u2013 again, this is now long lost in the YouTube archives. This was done back in the early 2000s. When was YouTube born?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: 2005, I think is when Google bought YouTube so a couple years before that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Yeah, I was thinking of '03. Yeah. Yeah. So early YouTube, basically \u2013 pre-smartphone, but early YouTube. So this is, you know, it's not \u2013 back then things were moving fast, as you know, there was \u2013 I hosted a spinoff for Nova \u2013 PBS Nova. It was called Nova Science Now. And unlike the classic Nova, where there's a disembodied narrator, and it's very staid, and very classical in its construct, this was much more fun. I was host, and I'd have correspondents and they'd bring in stories and I'd stitch them together. And so, one of the bits I did was just Neil Tyson in the neighborhood, right? And as I became more known, as I walked my kids to school or walked to the subway \u2013 I live in New York City \u2013 there were people, like shopkeepers. \"Hey, Neil, how's the universe today?\" Right? They would \u2013 they would wave. And \u2013 and there was a street sweeper said, \"Neil, how's the universe today?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo it was titled: How's the Universe Today? And what they would do is if they had a moment and I was there, they would ask me a question. They would say, I saw this news story about black holes, or what happened to Pluto? Did it really deserve that? And so there was this real curiosity that permeated an entire stratum of people in society, that society doesn't normally think of as deep thinkers, right? They typically go to the academic person. And I'm \u2013 so this was a beautiful thing for me to discover, this \u2013 this stratum. So I am never surprised now when I find someone who's otherwise just sort of regular Jane and Joe coming out with deep questions because it means when they go home, they don't always go out for a beer with the \u2013 with the townspeople. They'll stay home and watch a documentary.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo but what I want to \u2013 I began all this with Theo because he asked me a question, and only because I'm \u2013 I hang with comedians, can I \u2013 do I even have a place to stand to respond in the ways that I do sometimes. He said to me: So Neil, is outer space gay? He's like \u2013 I mean, the question makes no freaking sense, but let's try to have it make sense. So I said everything we measure in the universe, from mass, temperature, distance, size, practically anything that matters for objects in the universe, they come to us on a spectrum of values from very small to very large, very hot to very cold, very this to very that, very dense to very rarefied.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so I said, if the universe has a gender or a gender preference, it is surely going to appear on a spectrum. That's what I said. And so \u2013 then he said, \"Oh, so the universe is bi?\" He said, so that was a \u2013 it was a moment, I think. It was a scientific \u2013 I got to throw a little science in there, but still \u2013 but not say: No, that's a ridiculous question; let me answer a real question. I was able to sort of stay with the flow of him, his comedic style, and throw in a little bit of science with it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo that, for me, was a proud moment for me by working with him in his question to me so that everybody gets served at the end of the day.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And I think, you know, that is one of the things that I really appreciate about what you do. And I don't know how many people tell you this. So I grew up in rural central Virginia, and I'm the first person in my family who went to college. My dad was a construction worker. My granddad was a construction worker. My great granddad was a construction worker. My mom went...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: So what a failure you are in the family line.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so, you know, you sort of joke and laugh, but they're \u2013 the thing that I appreciate having done what I do is there's an enormous amount of value and dignity in what my dad and my, you know, my grandfather and my great grandfather did. Like there's nothing wrong. And like, I could have chosen that path and like, I would have had a wonderful, but very different life. And my dad was, you know, just as smart as I am. And he was just as curious as I was. And he just sort of focused that, you know, that \u2013 that intelligence and that curiosity on a different dimension.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd I think the thing that you do by talking to sixth graders and talking to comedians and talking to people who may not share exactly the same ideological view of the world that you do, and like not saying, well, you know, you didn't study nonlinear differential equations at Harvard, so like, you're not worth me talking to, like, I think it's a real special thing that you do, and I appreciate it. Like, it's a...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Well, thank you, and you \u2013 the key word there is \"dignity,\" I think. There's dignity in anything where someone sort of takes pride of what they do. They care that they're good at it. They \u2013 and I think that can be found in the entire job spectrum if \u2013 so, yeah. So yeah, that's \u2013 and I might count your \u2013 your family lineage as among the sort of blue collar intellectuals, the people who will spend time just contemplating our place in the universe without being prompted to do so \u2013 and then I just feed that, right?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: And I've got the smorgasbord here. If you want more, here some more. Come back for it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And you know, I probably \u2013 I'm more an engineer than I am a scientist, and that's probably influenced by the fact that the curiosity of my family was mostly focused on tinkering and invention and making things. And, you know, like, that's how they tried to explore the universe and understand how things worked.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: How things work, yeah.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And it is, you know, it's a thing I very much appreciate and respect. And, you know, anyway, like I will say it again, like, I think it's an unusual and a great thing that you, you know, like you have a science degree from Harvard, a PhD from Columbia, like you have this very distinguished academic track record. And like, you \u2013 you could choose not to go on Theo Von's podcast and, like, try to help him and his listeners better understand science, and I think the world would be poorer for it. And so, anyways...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Well, thank you. Thank you for noticing that. And I said it half-jokingly that I have a low bar \u2013 that what's really going on there is if \u2013 by the way, I'll show you how low the bar goes in a moment. But the \u2013 if someone from pop culture reaches to me to add science to what it is they're doing, especially artists of any kind, so writers, producers, set designers \u2013 sculptors, then I'm kind of there for them. And so, let me tell you how low the bar goes. I have a cameo in the feature-length film Sharknado 6.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Nice. Oh my God, that's the best thing I've heard today.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: So in \u201cSharknado 6,\u201d just to catch you up on the series, they\u2019re full movies, right? I think they only aired on the Syfy channel, but it's actual tornadoes made of sharks, so just don't question that; just accept it. All right? In \u201cSharknado 6,\u201d it opens a portal through the space-time continuum, and they go back 700 years or however long it was, 800 years, and they \u2013 the sharks cross-fertilize with dragons. And so you get a shark-dragon-nado. And in that sort of medieval time, I play Merlin...\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Nice...\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: And I'm doing actual science, but people think it's magic.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: That is excellent.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: So I said, I'm in. Okay.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: How could you possibly refuse that?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: I know. Amen. I was all in for that. So I just think to myself, selfishly, that if science can piggyback the efforts of artists \u2013 because in a lot of ways, artists define pop culture and sports as well, but combined, they're what everyone talks about over the office cooler and thinks about \u2013 that to the extent that science can piggyback that, then science becomes mainstreamed as it should have been all along and is not. And so, to the extent that I could do that, I think all of science benefits, and that's sort of the selfish part of it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: So \u2013 the sense that I have over the past 100 years is that we had more celebrity scientists \u2013 and maybe this is wrong with social media, but if you sort of think about the early 20th century with the Einsteins and Heisenbergs and Schrodinger and Teller and Dirac and Fermi, we had, you know particularly at the beginning of the atomic age, like a bunch of like very, very publicly well-known scientists.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd then, you know, even through the middle of the 20th century, like we had, you know, we had Carl Sagan, you know, like your inspiration. We had, you know, folks like Richard...\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Richard Feynman...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Sure. Like one of my absolute heroes. And it feels to me we have relatively less of that public recognition of famous scientists. And it wasn't that all of these folks were seeking the attention; it's just the attention was sort of focused on them. And I don't know whether you've ever thought about what might be different now versus then.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Well, yes, I have thought about that. And \u2013 by the way, I'm not ever the first in line to say it's different now than it was. That's a \u2013 it's a trap that people fall in because you think it's different because you're experiencing it firsthand, and anything else is just in a textbook, so how could they possibly know what you're going through, right? That kind of thing. So I have special analysis vectors within me that say, no, don't go in that direction because it's delusional. All right.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo it is true that there's a spate of scientists that were household names at a time when their expertise had geopolitical consequences. So the atomic era, you knew all the scientists who were involved in the atomic era because a bomb was made out of it, and then it became the very instrument that kept the world hostage during the Cold War. So that list that you recited, we knew all of these people, right? From Einstein on forward.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBy the way, some of them, Einstein included, did write popular-level books. He wrote one \"Out of My Later Years,\" which was a compilation. He wrote a \u2013 he co-wrote a book which was basically \u2013 they didn't have this title back then, but \u2018Relativity for Idiots\u2019 or whatever, whatever that series is \u2013 not idiots. What's it called? Yes, it's for idiots, right?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Dummies, maybe.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Dummies. Yeah. Relativity. It might today \u2013 might even call it Relativity for Dummies, but it was Relativity for the Common Man, right? And so, yes, keep in mind, though, you're integrating over 70 years of history there to say they were known over these 70 years.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRecently, I can name scientists that did become household names, like Richard Dawkins, and he continues to be. Like Stephen Hawking. Okay. And who lived way longer than anyone thought he would, all right? And he wrote best-selling books. In fact, he has the single best-selling science book of all time, which is the, of course, \"A Brief History of Time.\" So Richard Dawkins \u2013 and by the way, and Richard Dawkins was not even in the physical sciences. All the scientists you referenced were well known, and you knew them not just because you're a techie head person, but they were actually well known.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd but people did know, for example, Jonas Salk. All right? There's some biologists in there who were known. Earlier people knew Louis Pasteur. So I'm not going to agree with you that it's not known. Now, there was someone who was not a scientist, but he spoke very strongly on certain issues that touched upon science, and that was Christopher Hitchens. So there's a few \u2013 there's a few. Carl Sagan, you know, died now, I guess 25 years ago. It feels like just yesterday that he was around and with us.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut Bill Nye was a household name. Everyone saw him in their classroom. He's trained as an engineer, but his moniker was Bill Nye, the Science Guy. Of course, any engineer is fluent in science, so that's not a stretch. So these are people with very large platforms. And so I'm \u2013 I would say that the day science matters as much as it once did geopolitically, that you'll be fluent in all of the scientists\u2019 names at that time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis sort of happened with COVID. We all know who Anthony Fauci is. My regret there; it's a broad regret, is: How come we don't know the name of the president's science advisor? Why isn't that person in the news every day? Okay? And you're almost my age, we...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: You look younger than me, for sure.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: One day you'll be my age, but not yet. We're old enough to remember who the surgeon general \u2013 what was his name? He was in the news all the time during the AIDS epidemic in the '80. Koop.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, Everett Koop.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: C. Everett Koop. Yeah. Do you remember him? Okay.\u00a0 Household name, medical professional. And he was giving us advice. And some of it was controversial, but in the end, we knew it should be followed for the greater interest of public health. So I'm disappointed that no one knows who the surgeon general is today. Not the way we knew back then \u2013 that they're not propped up on platforms where they can be listened to and they can spread the scientific insights and wisdom that have been so hard earned in the laboratory in ways that they can benefit society.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOr the head of the National Science Foundation or the National Institutes of Health, or especially the National Academy of Sciences. All of them should have Twitter followings. Okay? And I think back to your original point, none of this \"let's reach the public\" is in their genetics. All right? They were not trained to think that way, to...yeah, it was...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, and they may not even have the personality for it. I mean, I think \u2013 the reason that I chose to be a computer scientist is for most of the years of my life, computers were more comfortable to deal with.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: They were your friend.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, it was an easier thing to interact with than my fellow human beings.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Yeah, people are complicated; computers are easy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And it took a lot of work to change that, and it was not natural...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: And now we're learning, in the sort of neurodiversity movement that, you know, many of my colleagues, surely yours as well, are actually on the autism spectrum. At some place, of course, high functioning, but nonetheless, you stick them in front of a camera, you know, are they even going to make eye contact, or do they even know that that's a thing to do? Or do they have facial expressions? There are things that, as a scientist, no, we're not trained to cultivate. And so I think we're feeling the consequences of that today because there are many high-level science leaders who could and should be helping to shape public policy, and they're just mute on the horizon.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: And I don't want to carry the whole slack. I mean, you know, I really just want to go to the Bahamas. Yeah.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. That much is coming through very clearly. You must be somewhere cold.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Am I making myself clear? You know, I delight in talking about the universe, but I'm dragged into other conversations about, you know, vaccines and about GMOs and about \u2013 and we should have very visible scientists in each of these categories. I should not be the one called for these. And so...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I do think there's a really interesting thing happening, right? You alluded to it a minute ago, which is, you know, these platforms like YouTube and TikTok and Instagram, and, you know, Twitch and like pick your thing, where we have an unprecedented amount of material for the curious that's good stuff that is very, very broadly distributed. I mean, like, I'll give you \u2013 like a weird example. Like, I am subscribed to this YouTube channel called Numberphile, which is largely a bunch...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: I know that. It's for number geeks, it's like...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: 100 percent. And so there was no video channel, no TV program when I was a kid where you could go to learn more from distinguished mathematicians about number theory. But there is now, and it's like great and awesome. And moreover, lots of people watch that channel. So, you know, it's not just them howling into the void. It's like people listening, and I think that's great. So...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Yeah. So, but it comes down to the obvious problem that \u2013 I mean, it's less of an issue with Numberphile. And I think there's another one, Math Nation or something. There's some \u2013 there's several math places to go visit. And \u2013 but those rarely show up in controversial feeds.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Yes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: So the question is, where does someone get the information that they need for the best interests of their health, their wealth or security, where they don't otherwise know where to even begin? How do you judge the integrity of an outlet? And, you know, like I said, that's obviously less of an issue with your math excursions, but the rest of it \u2013 and that's, of course, where the rubber hits the road today.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, and I think there's also, you know, in addition to getting that information that you need to live, you know, like a reasonable and prosperous and healthy life. There's also, you know, how do you find your role models? So, you know, and this, I really do want to, you know, get back to your origin story, like how you became interested in what you are interested in. But I think part of it for me at least, is role models. Like one of the great things that you're doing is, you know, you show up on, you know, these unusual places and sort of people look at, and they say, wow, Neil deGrasse Tyson seems like a reasonable human being, like maybe being a scientist isn't that bad. And like \u2013 and you need lots of kids thinking that, right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Right, right. Well, actually, so I think much less about kids than I do about adults because kids are born curious and they retain that curiosity\u00a0 middle school \u2013 so I'm not so worried about them as I am about adults, who think they're thinking rationally, and are not, and adults are in charge of the world. They wield resources, they vote, they lead. They're captains of industry. They're all the things that shape this world.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo yeah, we can target children, but I'm too impatient. I don't want to wait 30 years until they're old enough to then make a difference. Whereas adults can make a difference with a signature \u2013 with a pen at the bottom of a document that puts a new legislation into effect or a new educational directives or new mission statements. So that's been my goal. Now, in terms of role model, I think the term is a little overplayed, overvalued, I should say, for the following reason.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI grew up in the Bronx, New York. And if I needed another Black person who grew up in the Bronx before me, who then became an astrophysicist, to have preceded me, I would have never become an astrophysicist. So role models, inherent \u2013 as they are generally thought of \u2013 inherently require that you are not the first to do something. But suppose you have interest where you would be the first to do something, either first out of your town. Like you said, you're the first. What's your role model can't have been people in your town because none of them went to college. So \u2013 or in your family. All right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo at some point you have to say my role model is someone I have never met, and I may never meet, but I know enough about them that I want to emulate what happened in their life. And so for me, I knew this from very early. So I had an athletic role model of, you know, baseball, of course. I grew up in the Bronx where the Yankees play. So there was a Yankee that was a role model, I didn't want to be him. Just said if I played baseball, I wanted to play baseball as well as he did. All right? That's all. And I visited my local planetarium. The Hayden Planetarium. Took extra classes there. They had educators and scientists, and they had educators that had such a way with words and storytelling. I said, if I'm ever an educator, that's the kind of educator I want to be. And the scientists had such command of \u2013 and they just knew so much.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd the weird thing is, I remembered thinking, I will never know this much about the universe as much as they do, meanwhile they're twice my age at least, and I'm 15 when I'm having these thoughts, okay? And not realizing that when you get a PhD, you spend a whole five, six years studying that one subject. All right? And six years before that, I was nine. So I had to get the timescales understood within me. But, so, for me, a role model at its best is assembled a la carte from different people. And that's why, if you're visible, you should always, in the back of your head, ask yourself: Am I being something that someone else might want to emulate? Because that chance is very real, whether or not you ever meet the person.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so when I see little children coming through \u2013 the Hayden Planetarium is part of the American Museum of Natural History. There's school groups that come through. Many tourists, international tourists, but also camp groups. I see little kids and they're looking bright eyed. And all I've committed is that whatever I help create there will have the impact on that next generation the way the educators and scientists had an impact on me. Then I've given back to this world.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, which is an amazing thing. I mean, the way that I've thought about some of this for a while. And like, I think I had roughly the same experience that you did. I remember the first time that I picked up an academic computer science journal when I was a teenager. It was the ACM's Transaction on Programming Language and Systems, like this, you know...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Was it a bestseller? I think I saw that on the New York Times.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I opened this thing. I picked it off of the shelf of a library, and I was like, there's \u2013 I don't understand a single bit of this. And like, I can't even imagine a world where...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: That's quite literal too, a single bit. I see your double joke there, whether or not that was on purpose...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And you don't...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: You say that bit, but I took bytes. All right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: You're \u2013 you're eight times more advanced than I am.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Yeah, very good.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: I \u2013 you know, I had a hard time imagining a world where I would be able to understand it, much less be able to write. And so there's this process I think you go through where you sort of conquer this intimidation of not knowing. And if you can get past that, then you, you know, you can get to this miraculous state where not only do you understand these things, but you can write these papers yourself, and like, you even get to a point where people ask you to be a reviewer for these things, where you can sort of read a whole stack of papers, like 15 at a time, and give critical feedback about, like, what good and what's bad about them. And it's just...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Well, that's very educationally insightful, and I think what stops people is the idea where they open up something and they don't understand it, and then I don't know where they get this idea that you're supposed to understand something immediately if you're ever going to be good at it. I think there's some misdirection going on in our lives where \u2013 how many people, because they didn't catch it the first time they saw it, could have been great at it and just never even took the first steps?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd I remembered \u2013 I had maybe the same or slightly different motivation in high school when I was ready to take calculus and I opened up the calculus book, before I had enrolled for the course, and I looked at the \u2013 back then, I don't know if they still do \u2013 the \u2013 the jacket. You open up the front and back jacket and there would be \u2013 on the front were all these derivatives, and on the back were all these integrals. And I looked at it and I said, what the \u2013 squiggly lines, and I've never seen before. There's half the Greek alphabet. And I remembered saying, I will never understand this ever.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHowever, I was interested in the universe from very early on, and I knew that math was the language of the universe. So my motivation wasn't, gee, I want to know calculus for the sake of calculus. It was I want to know calculus so that I can be good at knowing the universe. And so that was my motivation. But it was daunting. And then after a month, we'd learned some things, and I reopened the jacket and I say, \"Hey, I know what that is.\" And as every week went by, a little bit more of this front and back flap became transparent.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo it was like this dense fog that first got thin and then completely dissipated. And then those pages became my best friends, because those were the tools for solving problems that were presented in the book. So I'm saying exactly what you just told me, but slightly to the side of your first encounter with this tech journal.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I have a 12-year-old and a 14-year-old kid. And like they both, you know, when they're doing their homework, they're like, oh, you know, like, I'm struggling with this. This is hard. And I'm like, yeah, like, that is almost certainly a sign that what you are doing is interesting and valuable because hard things are hard and easy things sometimes aren't worth doing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: And if it's easy, then everybody can do it. And if you want to distinguish yourself, do the hard things. And this is, of course, Kennedy's famous comment about going to the moon: \"We choose to do these things not because they're easy, but because they're hard.\" And then you've got to stop and think about that. Oh, my gosh, yeah, let's do the hard things. And then when you're done, the reward is that much sweeter for having accomplished it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes. Because, I mean, this is a thing that Arthur Clarke wrote about in \"Profiles of the Future\" in like '68, '69, I think, is when he published that book. And one of the things that he said, and I'm paraphrasing here, is that it's \u2013 you can't get to a new frontier unless you push past the boundary of what's impossible just a little bit. Like everything that needs to be discovered looks impossible. And like, you have to figure out how to, like, push that boundary of impossible to possible.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: But \u2013 and another \u2013 a corollary to that was some advice I received in graduate school from a professor named Martin Schwarzschild. He's actually related to Karl Schwarzschild, who he himself died in the on the field in the First World War. But was part of the Schwarzschild family anyway. He was an astrophysicist, Martin Schwarzschild.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe said something profoundly simple. He said: The day you stop making mistakes is the evidence that you are no longer on the frontier. And it's like, what? Wow. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Because on the frontier, you don't know what you're doing next. You don't \u2013 you're poking, right? You're prodding. You're overcoming bias of what is possible and what is not, and you're bound to falter. And that's not a sign that you're failing. It's the sign that you're succeeding in a way. So that helped to \u2013 soften the struggles that one might encounter when...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, or just even to normalize the idea that the struggle is normal. Everybody goes through it. There's no way to do anything useful to advance that frontier without the struggle. Like, there's no shortcut.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Right. Right. Right. But also, you've seen practically every YouTube self-help commercial, right? That you have to, like, sit through, or at least sit through the first 10 seconds of it. It's, by the way, so the key word, modern keyword \u2013 you're surely close to this, the key word for clickbait is \"this.\" That word is the new keyword, because here it is: Do this one thing each day to get \u2013 to lose 5 pounds a week; eat this. Eat this one food. And it's \u2013 and it's, oh, I want to know. And then you \u2013 then you dig in. What is this thing that you're doing? And so the \u2013 we're in a culture now where the marketing for things that would help your lives leave you with the impression that everyone's been doing it wrong all this time and that it's \u2013 and the struggles that they're doing is unnecessary. And you just have to do this one thing, and that takes care of it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI once \u2013 I took this to the to the dimension of the culinary arts where I tweeted this, I said: How often is it that you go to someone's house and some brilliant food you taste, and you \u2013 and you're prompted to ask, I try to make this, and it never turns out right. What's your secret? Right? So the answer is I went to chef's school for six years. And I've worked at this. That's the secret. All right? All right? Deal with that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: It's funny you went there because the whole time you were saying that I was thinking about \"Kung Fu Panda,\" which is one of my favorite movies of all time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: I remember it. I didn't see the sequels, but I remember Kung Fu Panda...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: The whole premise of the first movie is there's this thing called the Dragon Scroll, and if you like, get the Dragon Scroll, it will sort of unlock unlimited power \u2013 and the, you know, the villain at the end of the movie, like, gets the Dragon Scroll and pops it open, and there's nothing on it. And the Kung Fu Panda, who had already seen the Dragon Scroll tells him, it's like, yeah, it's like, there is no secret ingredient. It's all you, buddy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Yeah.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Maybe a couple of things before we run out of time, so I would love to talk about your book \"Starry Messenger,\" which everyone should go buy right now. It is a wonderful book. Maybe, you know, what's \u2013 what is the most interesting thing that you learned writing that book?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: You know, odd that you're the first person to ask me that. So thank you for recognizing that when any time you write a book, even when it's within your expertise, that you learn things that come together in a way for the book, that previously there was no urge to see or to feel or to glean.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis book \"Starry Messenger,\" which is a title from a Galileo's \u2013 I think it was his first book \u2013 called \"Sidereus Nuncius,\" \"Starry Messenger,\" where he reported his telescopic, his very first telescopic observations of the night sky and revealed messages from the stars. Messages. Oh, my gosh. The Milky Way is composed of stars. Oh, my gosh. That's a little weird. We just thought it was a band of smoke across the sky. Oh, the sun has spots. But wait a minute. But the sun is supposed to be a perfect object, a perfect orb. The moon has blemishes. It's got mountains, craters.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere's stuff that goes around the planet Jupiter. That Jupiter has moons. He didn't think of them as moons because we only have our moon. They were called the Jovian stars that traveled with Jupiter across the sky. So these were discoveries he made that helped change how we think of ourselves in this world. It decentralized Earth because until then, people were still content thinking Earth was the center of all motion. But he found observational evidence to support Copernicus, who, a century earlier, had sort of put the sun back in the middle of the known universe.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat I've done for \"Starry Messenger,\" subtitled: Cosmic Perspectives on Civilization, is I say, people, these are stuff you've dug your heels in or fighting about. I don't care what your political stripe is, you're having a fight over something that if you take a step back and look at this sort of cosmically, you will learn that either you're not fighting about anything, or what you thought was a strongly held posture is actually only thinly supported by objective truths in the world. And so, it's an attempt to thread and navigate all the ways people are currently divided by holding up a scientifically literate lens. And you look through the lens at that same problem and it looks completely different.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so there are chapter titles that are all these things we've all had arguments about over Thanksgiving dinner. So one of them is, is gender and identity, \"meat-tarians\" and vegetarians, truth and beauty, color and race, law and order, body and mind, life and death. And there's some others more classically titled \"Earth and Moon,\" \"Exploration and Discovery\" So these are chapters.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so, it was quite the exercise in revealing to people things that they've thought about but maybe didn't think about as deeply as they could have or as deeply as a scientist would be expected to. Because it's not just those things that fulfill your biases. What does it look like from every angle, even angles that I don't want to give it? All right? Because objective truths don't care about how you feel. They're separate and distinct from that. And hence this quote I put in one of my earlier books: The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it. So if we're going to have legislation and laws, let it be based on objective truths rather than on things you wish were true or just simply wanted to be true.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOh, so what did I learn? So in researching the gender and identity chapter, that was fun, of course, there's the chromosomal gender, which is XX, XY. So that's unambiguous. Are you male or are you female? And there are variations on that that are very rare where you can be intersex. But let's hold that aside for a moment. So you can be biologically male or female. That's clear. All right. So now, if you look at people, do these chromosomes manifest? That's an interesting question.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOkay. So I did this exercise, and I was in the subway. It was in the winter, and everyone has a big, heavy coat on. So just people's heads are popped out from the collar. And I looked down and I say, do I know who's male or female just by looking at their face? And the answer is, yes, I do. Okay. The answer is completely yes. On average, you know, the women or girls, their hair on average was longer. If they had earrings, the earrings were more dangly, eyebrows were tweezed. If there was any hair on the upper lip, it's removed. It's \u2013 there's eyeliner and mascara and plus, if you want to be a girl, go to the grocery. Go to the department store, to the girls, and they will know how to put girl clothes on you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd if you're a boy, you know how to dress like a boy because they tell you how. All right? And if you're a boy and your muscles are a little thin, go to the gym so you get big muscles. You want to be a boy. And if you want to be a girl, and your chest isn't big enough, go get breast augmentation surgery, as 300,000 women a year do.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd when I was done with this exercise, it was clear that everything I was cueing on are secondary and tertiary efforts that we put in ourselves to display the gender of our choice. And realizing this, it's \u2013 you're not looking at the chromosomes. We're looking at the beauty industrial complex. We're looking at the fashion industry telling you what you would look like if you followed their rules. So it occurred to me that if that's all secondary and tertiary, you're not looking at my chromosomes, and I feel like being a half boy, half girl today, then I'm going to dress accordingly. I might have, you know, wear boy clothing, but paint my nails. All right? That's because I feel that way today.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf I feel 90 \u2013 regardless of my chromosomes, I can make you think I'm whatever I want you to think because the industry empowers me to do so. And in a country where somewhere I read about pursuit of happiness, was it, somewhere in one of those documents? And without subtracting from your freedoms, and if my pursuit of happiness, I feel 10% male and 90% female today and dress as such, why should you care at all? You're a whole other person \u2013 if you don't want to do it, you know, no one's making you do it. But I'm \u2013 my sense of happiness is fulfilled by this.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo, by the way, this is not because \u2013 and the people say, well, are you a boy, or are you a girl? No, I'm some combination of the two. And the reason why you don't like it, is because the human brain prefers to compartmentalize. Even when we know things are on a spectrum, like hurricane strengths. That is a continuum of wind speeds. Okay? A continuum. Yet, we made five categories. That's better than two categories. But we made five categories. That has affected our thinking.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo Hurricane Irma goes from low Category 3 to high Category 3, and it's not much talked about it. It goes one mile an hour faster, crosses into Category 4, it is breaking news. Hurricane Irma now Category 4. Oh, you know, so the fact that we bin things this way actually influences how we think about it, even though it has no business being binned in the first place.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo my point is we know \u2013 we grew up with kids who did not \u2013 were not either boy or\u00a0 what's the \u2013 tomboys? There's a term for girls dressing like boys and were fighting in the dirt with the boys who wore short hair, like we have words for them. They existed. They didn't have some late latter-day invention. And getting back to your question, what's the something I learned? Here it is, in researching that chapter, took me to Joan of Arc, early 1400s, burned at the stake. Do you know why she was burned at the stake? Do you know? You're an educated man.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: I think I know.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: But what? Tell me. Tell me.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: I think she was burned at the stake because she was \u2013 like in a religious power struggle and got...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Okay, good. That's all right. That's part of it. All right. There was religious, political, religious conflict with France, England.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: But I don't know the exact reason. Like, I don't know what the sentence was.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Okay. All right. Half the reason cited, half was cross-dressing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Really?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Half. Cross-dressing. Now, of course, you can't lead soldiers into battle wearing a skirt riding sidesaddle. That doesn't work. So you got to wear some pants. Okay, so here's Joan of Arc leading soldiers into battle, and \u2013 all right. So they cite there's a line in Deuteronomy. It's very clear. It's: A man shall not don the clothes of a woman, nor a woman don the clothes of a man, lest this be an abomination unto the Lord, thy God. That's an almost exact quote.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo, clear. There it is. So it's in the court cases against her. And so we say \"cross-dressing,\" but maybe she really was on the gender spectrum. She has female chromosomes, but she was 100% male on the outside. There it is. And that's 600 years ago. 600 years ago. One of the most famous examples. And now, okay, they burned her at the stake, but now she's a saint. A Catholic church says, okay, we fucked up. All right, let's undo this. Okay? Statue of her in France. All right? Golden statue with a spear and a thing on a horse.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo this idea that you're either a boy or a girl, tell me, which is it? You can't be. No, you're just \u2013 in a free country? The very fact that there are people who are expressing themselves on a gender spectrum should tell us that we should not constrain the freedoms of others for the convenience of you thinking in only two categories.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd an analogy I gave is, you know, a computer bit is a 0 or a 1, and it's literally binary. Okay? That's \u2013 okay. But a qubit, a quantum bit, can be a 0 or a 1 or any statistical combination of the two. It could be 90%, 0; 10%, 1; or 10%, 0; 90%, or 50-50. At any given moment, you don't know what it is. It is the juxtaposition of those two values. Maybe we are not bits; we are qubits...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Here's another thought, too. So if you look at these binary systems, you still, like, electrons behave quantum mechanically, no matter what you would prefer that they do. And like, we do an extraordinary amount of work in the design of digital circuitry to make things...\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: To exploit that...\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Make things binary, like they're not naturally binary. You know, you have threshold voltages on comparators that drift with temperature, that, like, have electromagnetic interference. Like, you can have a cosmic ray come in and, like, knock something around.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: So what did, the point of what I did in the book throughout the book was take examples from science, and especially from the universe, how we think about these challenges, and then bring them to Earth. So that's why I left. Maybe we're all qubits. Take our cue from quantum physics and not from the limitations of the human brain to think on a continuum.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo that one, the Joan of Arc story. And in researching for this, there's actually a French docudrama. They didn't have that term back when this film was made. I think it was made in the '50s, that was very true to the trial of Joan of Arc. I think it's actually called the Trial of Joan of Arc. It might be \u2013 you might be able to find it archivally on YouTube, because I don't \u2013 no one's probably streaming it, but they \u2013 the text of it and the dialogue are recreations from the authentic. And it's just remarkable to watch that. Anyhow, that's what I learned. I learned more about Joan of Arc than I ever thought.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: That's very, very interesting. So one last question for you that I ask everyone. So you have a fascinating job and a varied amount of cool things that you do. But I ask everyone, like, what do you do in your copious free time for fun? That's not your job?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Oh, yeah. Oh, thank you for asking. Yeah, well, so that implies my job is not fun.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, no, no, no. And I don't even mean to imply that, because for most people that I talk to, their job is very fun. And...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Yeah, yeah. So they say: When are you going to take a vacation from your job? No, my job is my vacation. When I say \"the Bahamas,\" it's the rest of this public stuff that I'm referencing, not thinking about the universe, but I like reading very old books \u2013 nonfiction books. By the way, I hate the word \"nonfiction.\" I don't like what it is I write to be referenced to the negation of something else. So I want to introduce the word, there's fiction and you have \"faction.\" How about... I want to start that, like here and now. All right? The genre of nonfiction shall henceforth be called \"faction.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo I read just what scientists and popularizers have written about the state of their knowledge of the world at that time. And it helps me navigate any writings I do or that I read on the state of our knowledge today. It makes you humble in \u2013 even in the knowledge that you feel secure about. And it may show you doors that are there, and you didn't even know were there that need to be opened to see what's on the other side.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo I have books that go back several centuries on this. One of them was, there's \u2013 I have a book on the Sun. It was written in 1890, and then I have another version of it written in 1895, the second edition. And in the second edition, it says in the preface, it says: We've learned so much about the Sun in the last five years, I had to come out with a new edition. And I want to say, you have no idea what you still don't know about the sun. That's before they had any idea about nuclear fusion in the core, how it forms energy, how old the sun was. And so just to see the joy that they\u2019d learned some things about the magnetic fields of sunspots, that's what was a new thing. And it was just so quaint and so beautiful.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so I do that. I like watching a good blockbuster sci-fi movie while eating popcorn with slightly too much butter.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Do you have a \u2013 do you have a recent favorite?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: I saw \"Moonfall\" and until I saw \"Moonfall,\" I was sure that \"Armageddon\" led the list for violating the most laws of physics per minute of any movie. But \u2013 so I saw \"Moonfall.\" It had some fun actors in it, and I allow more than it sounds like I allow in a film. But \u2013 so I just like when they put some effort into the science and in the display and how they're going to do the zero-G and \u2013 how are they going to survive the environment. I'm a little fatigued now of superhero films, I think \u2013 did we forget how to tell stories? Did we run out of stories?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: So I got to ask, like, what did you think? Did you watch \"The Expanse\"?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: No. So there's a lot of hours of watching \"The Expanse,\" And so many of my friends told me I should. I watched the first episode and it didn't click for me, but they said, \"No, you got to keep watching.\" I said, \"Okay.\" So I have a task coming up. I have a book coming out in the fall, and they want me to pre-sign a bunch of, you know, pre-sign a bunch of them. The way they do it is you get the signature page, and then before it gets bound, at the bindery, and then they put that page in. That way, I don't have a stack of a thousand books in my room. It's just a stack of a thousand sheets of paper. And I do the math on this. How long does it take me to sign?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd it's pretty brainless, obviously. So that's when I do all my binging. So my next binge is going to be with \"The Expanse,\" and that's going to probably be in August. No \u2013 July, because the book comes out in September. My next book.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome. Well, I mean, congratulations on the book. And like, I will have to check back with you sometime in the early fall to see which...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Put you on the list again. Yeah, sure. Okay. Indeed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: So thank you so much for taking time out of your busy schedule to chat with me today.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: And thanks for having me. Just a shout-out to the geek set out there. I think we spent so much of our \u2013 of history just being abused and beaten up by the football quarterbacks and getting wedgied, and I always wanted to be a superhero who defended the geeks because I was bigger. I was bigger than other students, a little bit bigger, and I was athletic and strong. But I was a geek, so I could \u2013 so when I saw some abuses, I could like jump in and kick some ass because I was captain of my high school's wrestling team; I could kick some ass.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo I was \u2013 I always wanted there to be like a like, you know, the bat signal. But there'd be the geek and danger signal and it'd be like digits of pi on the clouds, right? And the more digits, the more serious the problem was. And I'd fly there and then kick some ass. That was my fantasy as a kid. But I think geeks and nerds in general gained pop currency when everyone else realized that we're the only ones who know how to fix their computers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: For sure. Well...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Back in the '80s and '90s, so they needed a geek friend. They could not just throw us \u2013 and then the richest people in the world, you know, Bill Gates, is a patron saint of geeks. So this was people: Oh, my gosh, they're wealthy and they can fix my computers. So I think we didn't really achieve parity until that era came upon us.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so just a shout-out to the entire community, especially those that, who, in the early days, were wedgied. I think I say in my book, I forgot in \"Body and Mind,\" there's a body and mind chapter. I say that in the Venn diagram of who is it? What'd I say? The Venn diagram of geeks and people who have ever been wedgied. And I think that the geeks completely encloses the who have ever been wedgied. So it's not an intersection; it's a complete enclosure.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, I appreciate you, Neil deGrasse Tyson. Maybe your title should be \"Defender of Deeks and Servant of Curiosity,\" like, it's a great calling.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: It's easy to be humble when you're a geek because there's always someone who's geekier than you, no matter how geeky you think you are. So I remembered calculating and posting my calculated measurement for the weight of Thor's hammer. Okay? In the first Thor movie, they said the hammer is forged in the heart of a dying star, and I say: Hey, I'm an astrophysicist. I know the densities of dying stars. All right?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo I got the density of a neutron star and I got the measurements of the thing \u2013 and I calculated it up. And so Thor's hammer, based on that calculation, would weigh as much as a herd of 300 million elephants. Okay? Which is why the Hulk couldn't even pick it up. So I said that was good and I'm proud of that. So I posted that. And so then, within 18 hours, there was some comic book site that said: Dr. Tyson, you're wrong about Thor's Hammer, okay? And in it, it goes on and on. And there's two \u2013 there's like engineers, material science engineers, who just \u2013 I just got out-geeked in this. So one of them said, you assumed that the hammer was made of the material of a dying star, but it was actually \u2013 that's the funniest word in the whole \u2013 \"actually!\" This fictitious hammer of this fictitious god was actually just forged not of it, but in the heart of a dying star, which meant it was not of the same material.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd apparently, in 1991, there was a Thor's Hammer trading card which said that Thor's hammer is made of the fictional material Uru, fine, and it weighs precisely 42.3 pounds. Okay.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: I like your \u2013 I mean, like, look, I appreciate...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: My answer, I think, was way funner than that, but I got to get \u2013 you got to tip. I got out-geeked. I got totally out-geeked, and then I had a fan who said: Neil, they didn't specify on what planet it weighs 42.3 pounds. And I said, \"Oh!\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: That's excellent. It's so good. Your \u2013 answer is more fun, but like you do have to respect comic book geeks. The attention to detail is real.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Exactly. So, yeah, you can't get too big-headed because somebody's \u2013 somebody's going to out-geek you. Another quick one, just in the minute, then I really have to go. So I was in the North \u2013 I was in Charlotte, North Carolina's airport, and I had to go from a big plane to a little plane. All right?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd it felt like I walked three miles. Maybe it was only one mile, but it felt like three miles. My luggage was heavy. I didn't have wheels. It was just a garment bag and my backpack. And so I finally get there and I said, all right, let me tweet something clever. So I tweeted: I can't wait till we have wormholes, that way all gates would be adjacent to one another. And that's pretty good, right? All right. Okay, that's give me some credit. All right? Well, in the comment thread, someone replied: Dr. Tyson, the day we have wormholes, you won't need airports. It was like, \"Oh!\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: That's a good point. That's a good point.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Out-geeked. Here I am in my finest geek form, and it just \u2013 I'm unworthy. So it's fun to just hang out with fun, smart people who know the difference between \u2013 they can fantasize, but also know the difference between real science and non-real science. And that's the interesting feature of the entire Comic-Con community, basically, what that is.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes, awesome.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: But anyway, dude, thanks for having me on. And congratulations on your whole career with Microsoft and all that you've contributed to them and shaping not just Microsoft as a company, but the culture of computing in this world. It has taproots, and so \u2013 and you're one of the threads of those taproots. So that doesn't go unnoticed by me.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Thank you. That's very, very kind of you to say. And again, I really, really appreciate what you do, and for you taking the time to talk with us today. All right. Be well.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Thank you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right, what a great, great conversation with Mr. Neil deGrasse Tyson. So before I get into some questions that I want to ask you, this is probably the only time in my life I will ever be able to do this, but I can actually fact check something that you and Neil were talking about when you're talking about Theo Von and questioning whether or not he went to college. Because I was 14 years old when Theo Vaughn was on Road Rules, Maximum Velocity Tour in 2000, I can tell you definitively that yes, he did. He did go to college. I don't know if he graduated, but he absolutely did. So\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: And he went to Louisiana State, right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I think so, I think so. Cause he's from Louisiana. So it was either University of Louisiana or Louisiana State was one of those. But yeah, I remember this very distinctly because I watched him on road rules and then the challenge after that. So yeah.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And, you know, again, I think one of the things Neil and I chatted about is, uh, you know, uh, so Theo, uh, Theo says a bunch of goofy things, uh, like, you know, a bunch of offensive things. podcast, like you can tell how smart he is, and like he is a super curious guy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Oh, 100%. He's very intelligent. And I think that it's actually interesting,\u00a0 think he and Neil do similar things in that they're able to disarm people and make them not be intimidated by some of the things they think about. Theo, I think, leans into his Southernness and kind of his persona. And so people don't know what they're getting. And Neil, who is obviously one of the most brilliant scientists and astrophysicists we have, because of his own curiosity and just his demeanor and the fact that he cares about pop culture and will do Sharknado 6, you know, I think can bring people who might be otherwise like less likely to care or want to engage or might even want to, frankly, tune out when sometimes faced with some of these things. I think that he's able to bring them in and to get a lot more accomplished because of that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, I think one of the really special things about Neil is for someone who is as accomplished as he is, and who, you know, is a scientist and like has been in this system where, you know, there's a whole process and there's rigor and like you have to, you know, there are big parts of your job where like you have to adhere to these notions of rigor just because like it's technically the only way that you can make progress in your field, like just pounding away at some of these scientific discoveries is just hard work and requires very, very disciplined thinking. And, but despite all of that, and I think he's unusual as a serious scientist, he has no pretense about himself or his field or what he knows or where he went to school. And like he willing to engage with. Yeah. I mean, you heard it over and over again in our conversation with anyone.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: As long as they're curious and they are willing to share, you know, their lives, their interests, their, uh, you know, their platform, uh, like in the service of science, like he's there. And, you know, just sort of authentically engaging with people and like with respect and, you know, affording them, you have the dignity that they deserve, you know, whatever it is, however old they are, whatever they do. And like, I think that's, that also is a great thing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I totally agree. And I think that it really, especially because he has those two parts, right? I think that empathy, that curiosity, that willingness to engage, but he is a very serious scientist. And I think that if we're wanting to get people to engage with science and to try to be more curious and to understand these very complicated things that are going on and to take more of these things seriously, I think that we need people like Neil in our world because otherwise it is just too easy to tune out. And it is, I think, too easy sometimes for people who are in, you know, in their bubble, whether it's academia or, you know, tech and research or whatever the case may be, to forget that the vast majority of the world is not in that bubble. And yet all of these things impact everyone.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Correct. and smart people are everywhere, curiosity is everywhere. It is a good thing to help anyone get some little new nugget of information. Like it's a beautiful thing. Like one of the best things about being human is like discovering something new and like playing a part in that is awesome.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: It absolutely is and I think it's great too, you know, because of Neil, you know, he was mentioning, you know, Carl Sagan earlier, but you know seeing when Cosmos when he was had his version of Cosmos on and when he was...When we have like in primetime this sort of content, that's revolutionary. Especially in this day and age that people will actually, from all over the world and from all walks of life and all backgrounds, will tune into those things. There's something powerful about that And I love it and I'm glad to hear two smart people like the two of you talking because that's what we need more of, I think, just people who are willing to engage and stay curious.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Definitely that for sure. That's the trick. And like one of the themes, I think across all of our guests, like everybody who's been on this show, like I think to a person, everyone has, has intense curiosity and like the only variation is like, you know, from that seed of intense curiosity, like, what do you go do with it?\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I think you're exactly right. I mean, honestly, we've been doing this for however many years now. I think that that's struck out to me too, is people are intensely curious, and that's what we need. And I think that it's what you do with it. And I think sometimes it's also, what does your curiosity maybe spur in others, make them curious about things? And that's how things continue to be building and evolving, which is really exciting.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yep. Awesome.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nCHRISTINA WARREN:\u00a0\nAll right, well, a big thank you to Neil deGrasse Tyson for joining us.
