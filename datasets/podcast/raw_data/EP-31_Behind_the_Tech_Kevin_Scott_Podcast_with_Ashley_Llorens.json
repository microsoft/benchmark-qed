To me, these big societal narratives should be at the top level of abstraction in terms of what we\u2019re talking about. And then everything else is derived from that. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone.  Welcome to Behind the Tech.  I'm your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we're going to get behind the tech.  We'll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did.  So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what's happening today.  Stick around.  \n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Hello, and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Christina Warren, senior cloud advocate at Microsoft.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And I\u2019m Kevin Scott. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Today on the show, we\u2019re joined by Ashley Llorens. Ashley is a scientist and engineer with a 20-year career in research and development of AI technologies at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and he recently joined Microsoft Research. Ashley is also a hip-hop artist known as SoulStice, and one of his songs was actually featured in the Oscar-nominated film The Blind Side. \n\nSo, I know there are a lot of theories out there about why so many scientists are also musicians, and there\u2019s this whole part about music being mathematical and scientists being good at recognizing the rules of music composition, but I\u2019m curious what you think, Kevin. \n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Well, you know, I think it\u2019s one of those mysterious things, because you are absolutely right, there are a lot of programmers and computer scientists who seem to have serious interest in music. \n\nBut I don\u2019t know many of them who are so serious about their music that they have a real recording career, and, like, I think that is one of the things that makes \u2013 one of many things that makes Ashley special. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  No, without a doubt. And I can\u2019t wait to hear you both talk about his various areas of expertise and kind of these dueling careers. So, let\u2019s chat with Ashley.\n\n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Our guest today is Ashley Llorens. Ashley is a scientist, engineer, and hip-hop artist. He worked for two decades at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory developing novel AI technologies and served as founding chief of the lab\u2019s intelligent systems center. \n\nHe was recently nominated by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to serve as an AI expert for the Global Partnership on AI. Besides his career in engineering, Ashley actually began his career as a hip-hop artist, and serves as a voting member of the Recording Academy for the Grammy Awards. \n\nAbout a month ago, Ashley joined Microsoft as a vice president, distinguished scientist, and managing director for Microsoft Research. Welcome to the show, Ashley \u2013 and to Microsoft. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Thanks so much, Kevin, great to be here. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  It\u2019s so, so awesome to have you here at Microsoft. So, we always start these podcasts by talking a little bit about where you got started. So, I know you grew up in Chicago. How did you get interested in \u2013 like, I guess either music or technology? \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Yeah, yeah, so, maybe we\u2019ll go in order and I can just kind of create two contrasting scenes for you. \n\nSo, you know, my interest in music growing up in Chicago, south side of Chicago, south suburbs, just really immersed in music throughout my childhood. And hip-hop in particular was always fascinating to me. Just the degree of storytelling, you know, the beats, the sounds growing up in the kind of east coast vibes, listening to artists like Nas, west coast artists as well. \n\nAnd it was, you know, it came \u2013 it grew to be something that, you know, I went from being a fan of to something I really wanted to contribute to \u2013 especially as I was sort of coming of age and wanting to express myself. \n\nSo, you know, the challenge with the \u2013 where we grew up and everything was, we didn\u2019t really have many outlets for that energy at first, you know? And so, we did what we could. You know, just kind of put a visual in your head, we would go to, you know, like the \u2013 what was it? Circuit City at the time or what have you. We had, like, a boom box with two tape decks. And that was the recording studio. \n\nAnd we were so proud of ourselves because we figured out how to do multi-layer vocals with a $20 mic and the two tape decks. You know, you record on the one tape and then you play it back and record over yourself and, you know, over some instrumental and you get the multi-track vocals. So that was, like, our, you know, $75 studio setup. \n\nAnd so, you know, and it just kind of went \u2013 kind of grew from there. And, you know, the contrasting scene, and of course we can come back to, like, the career trajectories and things, but the contrasting picture that I\u2019d love to paint is just around, you know, kind of the intellectual curiosity that was really a family value for us.  \n\nAnd, you know, really, both of my parents were teachers. My dad introduced me to two things early in life that really shaped my curiosity, one being theoretical physics, you know. I was quite young reading books by, like, Michio Kaku and not really understanding what string theory was, but really just being fascinated by it. And then Marvel Comics was the other thing. And, you know, just really, you know, the Infinity Gauntlet, something that\u2019s been a topic of conversation within our family for a few decades. So, it was great to see it on the screen. \n\nAnd so, you know, I just was really driven by a curiosity of understanding how the world works. Again, not as much of an outlet for that curiosity and that brings me to a story about outlets. You know, I actually ran one of my first electrical engineering experiments by peeling the paper off of a twist tie and then sticking it into an electrical outlet just to see what would happen, you know? \n\nSo, really, you have these two scenes kind of unfolding. And I say sharing some of the same fundamental motivations, you know, driven by curiosity, a passion for understanding people and technology, and really grew to, you know, a passion for having an impact on the world in these two different ways. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, it\u2019s so interesting that so many of the people that we chat with who have these large creative appetites, they\u2019re sort of creative across a whole bunch of different dimensions, like, have that grounded in curiosity. You know, just this sort of voracious curiosity about how the world works and, like, why things are the way that they are. \n\nI mean, it\u2019s really funny, this electrical outlet story, like, I did exactly the same thing when I was four years old. (Laughter.) \n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2019 a twist tie, but \u2013 and I forget what I jabbed I it, but I remember my mother screaming when, you know, there was this loud crack and, you know, her child was crying. And, you know, that sort of fearlessness that accompanies the curiosity I think is \u2013 you know, curiosity strikes me as something that you can certainly cultivate, but you know, it\u2019s hard to create when it\u2019s not there, whereas I do think fearlessness, like, you can sort of work really hard to become more fearless and, like, part of how fearless you can be is your environment. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Yeah, yeah, it\u2019s really interesting. I\u2019m always careful not to take too much credit for a lot of just the things that come naturally. I feel really fortunate, you know, to have these kind of fundamental drives and everything. \n\nI think as children, you know, we\u2019re sort of naturally driven by our curiosity to explore. And, you know, the outlet story is a great kind of illustration of that. I think as adults, a lot of times, if you\u2019re not careful, the world will cause you to unlearn some of those fundamental drives and, you know, being \u2013 you know, so I think part of the thing that I\u2019ve learned is to just allow myself to be driven by my curiosity and to behave fearlessly in that way and to ask questions and not be afraid to fail. And I think part of what I\u2019m grateful for is just that I\u2019ve managed not to unlearn those things as an adult, to kind of just behave childishly in that respect at this point in my life. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and so was your dad a physics professor?  \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  He was a math teacher, just with a \u2013 with just a passion for math and science. But, yeah, he was a high school math teacher and a track coach. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  That\u2019s awesome. So awesome. So, you know, like, I\u2019m just sort of curious, like, when you stuck that stripped wire tie into the socket, like, what did your parents do? \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  You know, I kind of got away with it. Nobody was really around, and it was just \u2013 it was an immediate kind of fascination with the, you know, kind of the explosion and the smoke \u2013 the little mini explosion and the smoke that happened, and then an overwhelming sense of guilt that I kind of carried. And, you know, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re listening to this podcast at some point, they may be surprised to learn that this was an experiment that I conducted. (Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Oh, that\u2019s awesome. Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s really \u2013 you know, we were talking about this on the last episode of the podcast with Jacob Collier, who\u2019s also a musician who uses technology in interesting ways. And, you know, one of the things that we were talking about is how you preserve the fearlessness when people are making themselves vulnerable by exploring. \n\nAnd having an environment, like, whether it\u2019s your parents when you\u2019re a kid or, you know, a set of colleagues or peers or your company or your institution that helps you \u2013 you know, they can figure out how to strike that line between, you know, sort of saying, \u201cWow, this is awesome that you are \u2013 you\u2019re exploring this curiosity, but you know, like, here are some things that can be better but, like, man, you should be really proud of yourself for pushing in this way.\u201d\n\nLike, is that something that you got as a child or, like, something that you had to learn over time or \u2013 \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  It\u2019s a great question. I think a lot about that as a parent, you know, of my own children. But also, in terms of leadership, you know, in a science and technology organization, but yeah, as a kid, you know, I mentioned this kind of intellectual curiosity as a family value. I never really got the sense that I was asking too many questions or that stupid questions were a bad thing. I thought my parents did a really good job of creating that kind of environment for us. I try to do the same for my kids. You know, I just get really used to saying, \u201cThat\u2019s a great question.\u201d You know, and just encouraging the asking of questions and entertaining the questions. \n\nAnd it\u2019s hard because, you know, there is a such thing as boundaries that you have to try to enforce as well. There is a such thing as, you know, what I say is going to go now, even though I\u2019ve entertained, you know, your thoughts and things. So, you know, I \u2013 striking the right balance there. \n\nBut, you know, just like, you know, I try to do for my kids, I try to create that environment in a professional setting as well, always leading with, \u201cMan, that\u2019s a fantastic question, let\u2019s take some time to explore that. Let\u2019s make sure we hear everybody\u2019s conflicting viewpoints before we go forward.\u201d But I say in a similar way, you do have to kind of set a direction and go eventually, so it\u2019s, you know, striking that balance. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, well, and it\u2019s sort of like the two stages, I think, of creativity in a group, like, you know, making sure that you hear everyone\u2019s voice, and everyone feels free to be bold in their thinking, even when they\u2019re vulnerable. Like, super important but, like, then you have to make a decision. Like, we called it at LinkedIn \u201cdisagree and commit.\u201d You know, so it\u2019s perfectly fine to disagree, but at some point, like, you have to make a choice about what you\u2019re going to do and then everybody needs to commit to doing that. It\u2019s a\u2013 \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Disagree and commit. I like that. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. (Laughter.) So, you know, you have like all this stuff that you are curious about as a kid, what\u2019s your school look like? Did you have a strong music program? Strong science program? Like, who is helping you explore these things that you\u2019re super interested in? \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Yeah, it\u2019s interesting. I\u2019m trying not to get too much into, like, local politics, but the way the school systems \u2013 school districts work in Illinois, where I\u2019m from, is that one set of schools is supported by the tax base around it. And it\u2019s not necessarily like a shared set of resources across schools. So, you have big inequities, you know, in terms of the level of resources. \n\nAnd so, I went to a school on the lower end of that spectrum just from a resourcing standpoint. So, that was always a challenge. Like, as I was leaving the school, it\u2019s better now, but as I was leaving the school, it was in the process of, like, losing its sports programs, you know, to debts and things like that. So, that was a tough environment. \n\nI would say I was still really fortunate to have some great role models. My math teacher, Mr. Amaro you know, I\u2019m going to go ahead and call out the name, was really just a great champion and would push us hard, you know. He was this gentleman of Cuban descent that was, you know, from Florida and spoke with an accent, but was always positive.  \n\nHe would wake up \u2013 he would get to school at, like, 6:30 in the morning and would expect you to be there at that time. You know, if you were participating on his math team, which I did. So, you know, there was my Spanish teacher and the principal that, you know, I got a chance to work with in student government. So, you know, I would say maybe even in an environment that was sort of resource constrained like that, I think it\u2019s possible to have, you know, some fantastic role models. So, I feel fortunate there. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And so, when you were thinking about going to college and in college, like, how did you choose what to do since you had so many things you were interested in? \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Yeah, yeah, you know, it\u2019s funny because when I think back to high school and this \u2013 because you\u2019re not really choosing a career at that point, you\u2019re choosing a major. And so, you find yourself in the guidance counselor\u2019s office. And it\u2019s like, \u201cHey, if you\u2019re smart, you do math or science.\u201d You know? I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s the right answer, necessarily, but that\u2019s definitely a prevailing wind I felt. \n\nSo, it felt somehow more pragmatic to me to pursue that aspect, just from a career standpoint. So, I wound up \u2013 and it also jived with a lot of the kind of intellectual curiosity that I mentioned. But I sort of have always stubbornly refused to give up the creative aspects as well. And so, I took narrative writing courses. And, you know, a lot of courses on the creativity side, too. \n\nI probably would have had a minor in those things if the engineering school had allowed it. And I\u2019d say that kind of duality tracked me, you know, into my career. So, if you fast-forward a bit to 2003, I was kind of graduating from graduate school and starting a record label at the same time. \n\nAnd my plan was to just move into science and technology long enough to fund a record label, and then leave and go do music full time. Because even having advanced to that point, you know, after having gone through undergrad and kind of gotten my master\u2019s and all, I still didn\u2019t really believe that a career in engineering was for me. Like, I didn\u2019t have very many role models that were professional engineers and scientists, so I wasn\u2019t really sure if it was a place that I could kind of be myself, you know, be intellectually curious and be entrepreneurial and kind of have an impact on my own terms. Those things were very important to me. \n\nSo, you know, so I kind of set off. And what I found was, first of all, the opportunity to do both \u2013 so I kind of hung onto those things for as long as I could. For a good 10 years, I was doing both things. On the music side, just figuring out how to press records \u2013 vinyl records \u2013 and how to get my records into places like clubs in Tokyo, and then how to get myself into places like clubs in Tokyo to, you know to do performances. And it kind of took me around the world and many adventures. \n\nBut, you know, on a parallel path, I was really figuring out how to chart my own course within science and technology, how to be myself in doing those things, and really discovering a kind of really cool career path right at the intersection of science and engineering and having opportunities to be a principal investigator, even as a fairly young scientist, you know, for the Office of Naval Research and other sponsors. \n\nSo, publishing, you know, so if you think science, you know, engineering and music. So, publishing papers and academic conferences. Going to \u2013 flying overseas to do those conferences, but then leaving the poster session to go do a show at the club, you know.  \n\nPresenting a research in Prague and then doing a show in Prague, you know, and then eventually, you know, being able to turn a lot of those scientific advancements into real-world technologies for the Navy and other sponsors. So, just a tremendous set of adventures as I kind of reflect on it. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And what did you major in in college? \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Yeah, so my undergrad was computer engineering. ECE is kind of a joint college anyway, but my undergrad was computer engineering, and then my master\u2019s research focused on electrical engineering, digital signal processing. And then when I entered the professional environment, I immediately discovered machine learning, which eventually led me to artificial intelligence. \n\nSo, it\u2019s interesting how, you know, 20 years \u2013 20-some-odd years ago, you could go through a whole degree without ever bumping into machine learning. I didn\u2019t discover machine learning until I got into my professional environment, but then I was kind of immediately hooked. \n\nYou know, early in my career, I wouldn\u2019t have dared say I was into artificial intelligence. Like, that\u2019s not what you said, you know, and you definitely didn\u2019t talk about neural networks at all if you wanted to get your research funded. So, but you know, as I advanced from you know machine learning for human systems, you know, kind of as decision support tools for humans, to more robotics and autonomous systems, it naturally leads you to grander thoughts about artificial intelligence. You\u2019re creating an agent that\u2019s going to go out in the world and perceive and understand its environment and act on the basis of its own perception. \n\nAnd in my case, you know, I spent a lot of time developing technologies for underwater robots \u2013 autonomous underwater systems. And so, you know, this is not a clean laboratory setting. This is the ocean. So, you\u2019re creating something that has to go out there and fend for itself in an open environment. \n\nAnd it naturally leads you to you know grander questions about more robust and generalizable forms of intelligence, which it\u2019s been amazing to kind of have an opportunity to think more and more about as I advance in my career. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 I mean, you and I probably were in school at the same time \u2013 I think I\u2019m a little bit older than you are but like we were in school in the \u201890s, I\u2019m guessing. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Yes. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And, yeah, you\u2019re totally right, like, there was, like, when I was getting my \u2013 or working on my PhD, I dropped out, much to my advisor\u2019s chagrin. You know, like, you are absolutely right, like, you just didn\u2019t mention neural networks if you wanted, you know, you wanted to graduate and get your papers published. (Laughter.) \n\nSo, it\u2019s really amazing to see how much has changed just over the past 20 years and even accelerating over the past 10. \n\nSo, but I do want to go back for a minute and sort of chat about this interplay that must have existed between your professional career and your music career. Did they benefit each other? \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Yeah, that\u2019s a great question. And it was an interesting journey to kind of discover the interplay. I would have said something like not so much at the very beginning of that journey, but I think the intersections kind of have presented themselves to me over time and have been really satisfying to see. \n\nOn the music side, you know, especially as an independent artist with a very low budget, you know, you had to really be convincing to convince people to work with you for little or no money. Right? Or at least up front. And so, you know, you have to develop the skill of creating a pitch for yourself \u2013 a story that you know people would sort of buy into, a vision for where you were going. And then as, you know, the executive producer of an album, you\u2019re a project manager, you know? It needs a budget, it needs milestones, you know, you\u2019re going to have roles and responsibilities if you\u2019re ever going to get anything out into the world. \n\nAnd so, there\u2019s interesting aspects of those things, obviously, transcend both. And then from a technology standpoint, you know, if you think about audio recording and, you know, audio engineering, it\u2019s engineering. You know? It\u2019s frequency selective signal processing, it\u2019s filters, it\u2019s gains and amplification and all kinds of things. And so, I definitely think from a technology standpoint, from a project management standpoint, and I\u2019d add another dimension, too, just communications and storytelling really transcend both. \n\nAnd so over time, again, you know, a lot of these intersections have sort of presented themselves. And I realized even without, you know, knowing it at the time that each was benefiting from the other. \n\nOne of the things that\u2019s been fun about my music career is sort of figuring out how things happen and how things get done. So, at one point, you know, it was just a curiosity. Like, how do I get things into music and TV? Just another challenge, right? \n\nSo, what I discovered is that there\u2019s these agents, right? And they, you know, they bring opportunities. And so, what you have is you have movie editors, video editors.  A lot of times, they put these \u2013 they get to the end of their production, they have these reference songs in there. And so, you know, at some point, they \u2013 in The Blind Side, they got to the end and there was a scene that they had 50 Cent\u2019s In Da Club. And they\u2019re, like, well, we ain\u2019t paying to license this song. So, then, they put out, you know, they put out the call, like, to all the agents. \n\nAnd my agent comes to me and they said, \u201cWe need a replacement for 50 Cent\u2019s In Da Club.\u201d So, I call my guy in Ohio and I\u2019m, like, okay, let\u2019s, you know, let\u2019s put something together. So, I made two songs for them. One was That Thing, and it \u2013 you know, it\u2019s not really my voice, it\u2019s me replacing that song. You know, it\u2019s my physical voice, but not my voice as an artist, but it\u2019s still fun. And that one wound up in The Blind Side.\n\nThe second one I made for that spot to replace the 50 Cent song was one that actually wound up in 50 Cent\u2019s Power a few years later. So, that was \u2013 it was the two things I made to replace 50 Cent in the reference soundtrack. So, it\u2019s kind of a cool story. But, no, I didn\u2019t meet 50 Cent or anything like that. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s fascinating that you said that. Like, one of the reasons I try to explain this stuff. So, I love to learn about stuff. And the process of learning, for me, is almost better than the end product that I, you know, I end up. \n\nAnd so, like, that whole idea about, like, figuring out how all of this craziness works behind the scenes, like, that sounds so appealing, like, more appealing than the song, itself. And \u2013 \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  That\u2019s exactly right. That\u2019s the fun of it, for sure. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Ton of fun. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Yeah. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  You know, it\u2019s sort of interesting. Do you ever feel like the \u2013 that it\u2019s easier for people to engage with and maybe even have more curiosity about the music work that you\u2019ve done versus this machine learning work that you\u2019re doing? Given that like everybody sort of understands music, right? Like, it\u2019s just something innate in us that, like, we are musical. We appreciate music, you know, to the degree of, like, being a fan of musical artforms and, like, fans of the people who create it. But like, you don\u2019t really have that with technology in the same way. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  You know, it\u2019s interesting. So, this was actually something I really worried about at the beginning of my career. And I have to confess, I actively tried to keep my music and work separate. And I was not very forthcoming about the music side of what I was doing at work because I wanted to be taken seriously as a technologist. I was already someone who was from an underrepresented demographic, you know, from that standpoint, being a black person, a black male in science and technology. So, to add that dimension, too, I was like, \u201cOkay, let me just focus on, you know, the science and the tech when I\u2019m at work.\u201d\n\nBut even that over time, you know, I grew to realize that I could kind of bring my whole self and present both sides, but it was easier as I had a track record of scientific and technological accomplishments to back it up. It was hard when I was a blank slate coming out of college. So, you know, for better or worse, I\u2019m not sure what the right and wrong of that was. \n\nBut, you know, I did wind up, for example, if you go on YouTube, you know, you\u2019ll find a clip of me doing a hip-hop duo with the director of the Applied Physics Laboratory at one of the all-hands addresses. And so that was, like, the big coming-out party at work for the hip-hop side. \n\nYou know, on the technology side, though, 20 years ago or you know 15 years ago, you say you\u2019re doing machine learning, people are like, \u201cOh, what\u2019s that? That sounds curious. Machines learn? I never heard of that.\u201d  \n\nNow, it\u2019s a little different. You know? You know, people know what AI is. When you say you do AI or machine learning, they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, tell me more. You know, I hear about this stuff all the time.\u201d And that plus the fact that technology is forming such a profound substrate of our whole human experience now, I think people are just more naturally engaged and curious about technology because it\u2019s such a part of our lives. And so, whereas it started more so the kind of arts and music was something that people relate to, now, I don\u2019t necessarily see a difference, you know, in terms of the levels to which people are engaged in these two things. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  So, you know, I think this whole notion of narrative, the thing that you were talking about a minute ago, was really important. So, like, you just sort of got, you know, in your musical career that you are telling stories and you sort of understood as a young professional that you had to tell a story about yourself. And I think with technologies like machine learning, narrative is also really important because they\u2019re complicated. And if you go all the way to the bottom just in terms of how they\u2019re implemented, the complexity of these things is very high. \n\nYeah, the narrative is really important because it\u2019s such an important technology and it is having such a profound impact on what the future is looking like every day as it unfolds that people need to be able to understand how to engage with it to sort of, like, what do I think about this technology? What do I think about policy about this technology? What do I think about, you know, like, my hopes and my fears for the future of this technology? \n\nSo how, you know, have you thought much about, like, you know, the story of AI? \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Yeah, absolutely. And maybe there\u2019s a couple of sides \u2013 well, there\u2019s many sides, but maybe two sides I\u2019ll pick to explore there. One is absolutely the idea that AI has taken us in a bold new direction as a society. And I think it\u2019s more important than ever that we can engage around these policy questions and really around the directions of AI [remove stumble] definitely outside of computer science and across disciplines. And so, we do need to create narratives. Even more than that, I think we need to create directions that we agree on that we want to take this technology. \n\nA lot of times, I think people are discussing AI as something separate from human beings and human intelligence, and I think we need to be thinking of these two things as complementary. \n\nSo, what are our goals for these things, you know. Can we start to set some audacious goals around enabling as many people as possible on the planet to live a long, healthy life, creating an atmosphere of shared prosperity, and what is the role of AI in doing that? \n\nTo me, these big societal narratives should be at the top level of abstraction in terms of what we\u2019re talking about. And then everything else is derived from that.  \n\nI think if we\u2019re going to just let 1,000 flowers bloom and see where we land on this thing, I think we could wind up with some really unintended consequences, you know, from that. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. I really, really agree. And I think, you know, too, if you have the wrong narrative, you could have unintended consequences as well. Like, one of the things that I have been telling people over and over again over the past handful of years as just sort of a useful device about thinking about the future of AI is that AI, like especially its embodiment in machine learning, is a tool. And just like any other tool that people have invented, like it\u2019s a human-made thing and, like, humans use it to accomplish a whole wide variety of tasks. \n\nAnd, you know, the tool is going to be as good or as bad as the uses to which we put it. And, you know, it\u2019s just very, very important I think for us to, like, have a set of hopeful things that we\u2019re thinking about for, you know, those uses of AI as, you know, we have our anxieties. And both are important. Like, you have to \u2013 you know, it will certainly be used for bad things. \n\nBut, you know, as with any technology, like, the hope is that there will be orders of magnitude more positive things and good things that people will attempt to do with it than the bad. And part of how we get to that balance of good versus bad is the stories that we\u2019re telling ourselves right now about what it\u2019s capable of and, like, what to be wary about. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  I think that\u2019s right on point. And, you know, we can even ask yourself, you know, what does it mean to behave intelligently as a species? I actually think we\u2019re getting to the point where we can start asking ourselves and holding ourselves to, you know, to some standard there. \n\nYou know, if you just think about artificial intelligence at a low level, you know, from an agent standpoint, you know, I think intelligence, itself, is the ability to achieve goals, to set and achieve goals. And then what do you have to do? You have to be able to have some understanding of the world around you, you know, through some mechanisms of perception, whether that\u2019s kind of our human modalities or other kinds of modalities. \n\nYou have to decide on a course of action, you know, that best achieves your goals. And then you have to carry it out. Like, these are the things you do to be intelligent. So, when you extrapolate that to us as a species, because one of the hallmarks of human intelligence is our social intelligence, our ability to you know to collectively set \u2013 pursue goals and things like that. \n\nSo, I think \u2013 I\u2019m sort of \u2013 as you can see, I\u2019m sort of cursed now to see everything through the lens of intelligence and, you know, artificial intelligence. This is just how I \u2013 my lens on the world. But I think it\u2019s helpful. I think it\u2019s useful. I think in order to behave intelligently as a species, we have to do some of these things that you\u2019re talking about \u2013 setting some bold visions and directions and figuring out how to organize around those. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. When I was a kid, the thing that really inspired me, I think, to become a scientist were the stories that I was reading. And, you know, I grew up in the \u201870s and \u201880s and you had a whole mix of things I read a bunch of science fiction that was, sort of techno-Utopian. It was these future worlds that had a bunch of technology, some of which now exists, some of which will probably never exist and, , sort of people living these, crazy, interesting lives, you know, like full of drama, in these futuristic worlds. \n\nAnd then you had some dystopian things as well. You know, I always sort of think about, like, these two different portrayals of AI. There\u2019s Commander Data from Stark Trek, the Next Generation, and then there\u2019s The Terminator, you know, from the Terminator movies. You know, the latter is sort of the, you know, the anxious depiction of AI, like, what happens if you build machines that, you know, get out of control? \n\nAnd the Commander Data, you know, version of AI I think is really, really interesting because I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ve watched the Star Trek Picard series, which is the recent thing with Patrick Stewart and, like, Data, again, played this very, very important role in the story that they were telling. And, like, the interesting thing about Data is that even though he was an android, he was an artificial intelligence. He was always the thing that the writers in Star Trek used to shine a spotlight on humanity. So, like, he, you know, in some sense was, like, the most human character in the show and, like, they sort of used his artificiality as this plot device to sort of explore what our human nature is. \n\nAnd, like, I think that sort of gets to what you were just talking about, like, I think, you know, AI may tell us an awful lot about who we are. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Yeah, I think that\u2019s right. And I want to seize on the theme of dystopian thinking, because you and I were, you know, talking previously about kind of the Utopian thinking, you know, setting goals. And I do think it\u2019s even, you know, increasingly important to do that dystopian thinking, to do it in a way that\u2019s constructive.  \n\nYou know, coming from kind of the federal science and technology space and advising, you know, within the Department of Defense and those kinds of circles, it\u2019s easy to get focused on really kind of hyperbolic types of concerns, like the Terminator and Skynet and all those things. \n\nSo, I like us to do more dystopian thinking, but I do like us to also ask the right questions, to take that mirror, you know, and kind of reflect, like you were saying with Commander Data. And if you think about the mirror, there\u2019s a series of Netflix that I love called Black Mirror. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  And so, this is the reflection. I think these are the kinds of concerns we should really be thinking seriously about \u2013 ways in which people will use technologies, you know, in a way that hurts people. You know, whether through positive intent or negative intent. \n\nI love the kind of Twilight Zone-esque you know, ways in which the best intentions or, you know, kind of turned into unintended consequences through things like, you know, the killer bees episode, you know, as a kind of cautionary tale on autonomous systems or the episode where the brain-computer interface that the gentleman is using imprisons him in his own mind. \n\nI think these are \u2013 those particular questions may not be the right one, but that way of thinking that, you know, the dystopian thinking, but really asking the right questions I think is important for us as we move forward. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, it is an interesting ethical dilemma, I think, thinking about where the line is between inaction and, you know, sort of safeguarded action. Like, the safest thing to do in life is to, you know, sort of stay at home and don\u2019t come into contact with anyone else and, you know, just \u2013 you can sort of surround yourself in this bubble of safety where you really can\u2019t do much. And you can look at almost any substantial technology that we\u2019ve ever built and, like, if you let your imagination run wild, you are going to be able to imagine, like, a huge number of bad things that you can do with the technology. \n\nAnd if you let that imagination paralyze you and convince you not to build the technology at all, not to, you know, leave your house at the beginning of the day to engage with the rest of humankind, like, you miss out on, these incredible things that help us become more human, I think. \n\nAnd, you know, and then to solve, like, really, you know, important problems, like, you know, that help us be healthier and live longer and, like, have you know, much higher quality of life and, you know, that supports a larger population on the planet. You know, like, and, and, and \u2013 like, if you, like, just stripped away even the past 50 years\u2019 worth of technological development, like, the world would be in a terrific amount of trouble, which is something we often forget. \n\nYou know, so, like, it\u2019s that framework that you use to decide on, like, how you balance, you know, positive action versus inaction and, like, not get paralyzed, like, in one way or the other. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  I think it\u2019s right. I think you articulated the trade space there very well. I think, and I don\u2019t know the right answer \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Neither do I. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  This is the trade space to be aware of and always conscious of. I also think we need the right dose of humility about our understanding of the world and ourselves. We still have so much to learn, even about the ways that our own bodies and minds work, much less the very rich, interconnected, you know, ecological systems that we live inside of. \n\nYou know, I was in \u2013 I was actually moderating a panel at the National Academy of Sciences about science communication and the communication around uncertainty in science, and you know, the discussion \u2013 I\u2019m not an expert in this area, but the discussion was about genetic manipulation and doing things like putting genetic manipulations out into populations of, say, insects or something to cause some population-level change. \n\nAnd the idea of making a change like that in an ecological system that\u2019s so interconnected, you know, and the repercussions and the unintended consequences that could happen, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s necessarily the right or wrong thing to do, but certainly, I think we need to approach it with the right dose of humility and to be humble as we explore that trade space that you just laid out there. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. Look, I think that notion of humility is extraordinarily important for so many reasons. Maybe the, you know, one of the more important reasons we need to have humility is just that we need to make sure that we\u2019re not drinking our own Kool-Aid, so to speak, that we\u2019re not overconfident about what it is we think all of our technology and all of our science is telling us. \n\nOne of the things that, you know, that I\u2019ve tried to push back on a lot over the past 12 months is, you know, folks who are trying to take all of their incredible IQ and all of their incredible energy and apply it to, you know, helping with the pandemic. And, you know, it\u2019s this horrible thing and we\u2019ve got this tremendous sense of urgency. And, like, even though we have that urgency, like, I\u2019ve tried really hard to help us or to, like, encourage people to not throw away our scientific process. \n\nThe scientific process is, like, so valuable because its only allegiance is to truth. And, like, that process of finding the truth is, like, incredibly messy and, like, even when you think you\u2019ve found truth, like, you probably haven\u2019t and, you know, just sort of constantly reassessing, like, what you think you believe and, like, how you arrived at those beliefs is integral to the way science works. \n\nYou know, and it\u2019s sort of unforgiving, right, like, if insist dogmatically that this thing is true and, you know, like, you just haven\u2019t used all of this, you know, apparatus of scientific rigor that we\u2019ve built up over the centuries, you know, like, things will spectacularly fail. \n\nSo, anyway, you know, I \u2013 like, I think that humility is, like, you know, like, we really have to not think that we understand more than we do and, like, we, you know, we certainly shouldn\u2019t be, you know, sort of insisting that we\u2019ve found truths that we really haven\u2019t proved out. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Yeah, yeah, so important. And maybe this is a great segue into aspects around diversity and inclusion because I do think that can really be a superpower for us if we leverage it. Because like you said, it\u2019s so messy, you know, getting to, you know, getting from our subjective observations, even of experimental data, much less, you know, a world experience. And everyone, even when you try to be unbiased, you bring all that inherent world view into everything that you do. \n\nAnd in some of these cases, I think our only hope is to integrate over enough of those conflicting world views to try triangulate on what is objectively true, or at least the closest we can get there. And that\u2019s, you know, there are so many aspects of diversity to really be focused on, you know, demographic diversity, etc. But you definitely need people that think differently, that have a different lived experience, etc. How do we create pipelines of those folks into these fields? How do we create safe spaces for people to think differently and pursue their careers differently? There\u2019s just so many aspects. \n\nBut I think if we get it wrong, we\u2019re dooming ourselves, I think, to the kinds of group think that happen when you have a lot of folks that \u2013 when you\u2019re not integrating, so to speak, over a lot of these differing world views. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, I could not agree with you more. You know, I think the things that I\u2019ve seen be most successful over my, you know, couple of decades as a professional in technology have been places where you have exactly what you said, that diversity of experiences, that diversity of perspectives, that diversity of backgrounds, and like, a real diversity of thinking. \n\nWho knows how many wonderful things that you can dream up or how many things you can inspire in others because you are both a musician and an engineer? And like having more of that, like, I think is just so valuable. There are like infinite wonders in the world that we will never discover, which is like maybe one of those, you know, sort of optimistic slash depressing things to say. And, like we won\u2019t even get to, you know, like, the interesting part of that infinity unless, like, everybody is bringing the best that they have to figuring out what the future is. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Yeah, I think thought\u2019s right. And you know, even as our technologies advance, etc., I think the kinds of global challenges that we have to step up to are getting greater and greater. And if you take this \u2013 you know, this simulation that we\u2019re all kind of involved in and you fast \u2013 you know, you fast-forward it enough years, you know, the statistically improbable things that we sort of are afraid of, you know, they come to fruition. And the pandemic is, you know, an illustration. So, I do think we have to figure this out and get to the point where we\u2019re sort of activating our collective intelligence in the best possible way. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, and I think that, you know, if you think about some of these things like preventing the next pandemic or, like, making the impact of the next pandemic less than, you know, less than everyone that came before them or climate change or, you know, sort of dealing with the demographic inversions that are happening in the industrialized world.  \n\nPopulation growth is going to slow down in the U.S. and Europe and China, Japan, and Korea, like it will start to slow down in India, and then it\u2019s going to start booming in Africa. And so, you know, the thing that we know is that, you know, population growth is the thing that, you know, implies, like, the growth of ingenuity and creativity and whatnot. And so, like, you can start investing now in Africa so that as that population explodes over the coming decades, like, all of those energetic young people are going to be equipped to, like, help all of us old folks, like, figure out how to solve some of the big, big challenges that we\u2019ve got facing us. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Yeah, I think that\u2019s absolutely right. And, you know, even, again, I\u2019m not an expert in everything that I\u2019m curious about, but it also seems to me that a lot of our economic systems are sort of predicated on this notion of an expanding population. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yes. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  You know, there\u2019s some interconnectedness there. And so, you know, as these population trends start to invert, like you\u2019re saying, we need to do some serious thinking about how our economic markets and things allocate resources and all that. So, there are some really substantive and fundamental things I think we\u2019re going to need to be rethinking here. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, I mean, I think you mentioned, like, one of the \u2013 you mentioned a couple times, actually. Like, one of the things that we should with a tremendous amount of urgency be focusing on is, like, how you can use machine learning to help with healthcare and aging. You know, I read this article last year in the New York Times about the eldercare crisis in Maine, where there just aren\u2019t enough people to help take care of the aging population there. And so, like, it\u2019s not a wage thing or anything. For no amount of money, you can hire, you know, enough people to take care of all of the elderly. \n\nAnd, you know, this is going to play out everywhere soon. I think in Japan, like, they already are, like, seriously thinking about the technology that has to be built to help make sure that, you know, you can have the elderly living a dignified life in their later years and, like, you still are able to pick up the slack and productivity in the population because you have fewer workers that you\u2019ve ever had before. And, like, you preserve the ability of what workers that you do have to be able to do their jobs and, like, you know, do the creative things that they\u2019re doing to, you know, build the future of those societies, you know, without being completely consumed with taking care of their parents and older relatives. \n\nAnd, like, the only thing that sorts that out is technology. Otherwise, you\u2019d just have a collapse in, like, the quality of life because there just aren\u2019t enough people to do all of the work. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Yeah, absolutely. And then there I think we have a really amazing opportunity in automation and autonomous systems, where AI and robotics meet. You know, the ability to ingest data, do analysis, make decisions, but also to carry those decisions out. \n\nWhether they\u2019re in \u2013 you know, we have a lot of automation emerging in factory settings and controlled environments, but you know, I think a lot of the challenge, you know, comes in these more open environments, these less structured environments, environments with people and really making robotics and automation work in those kinds of settings. I just love to see more and more of our intellectual capacity thinking about some of those challenges in a human-centered way. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, I could not agree more. So, we\u2019re almost up on time here. So, I think the last thing I like to ask everyone is what you do for fun or in your spare time. It\u2019s sort of a weird question, because I think almost everyone I chat with, like, thinks that their work is fun, and they don\u2019t have much spare time. But I ask the question anyway. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Well, so I\u2019m definitely one of those folks. I\u2019m definitely one of those people that thinks my work is fun. But I love being a father. I love hanging out with my kids. And, you know, in pandemic times, it\u2019s been all about video games and virtual social experiences through video game platforms have been just the thing that, you know, has kept the social fabric together, you know, among our kids and their friend circles and everything. \n\nSo, I\u2019m someone who grew up on video games and, you know, had a Nintendo, you know, and an Atari and all those things. So, I love games. And then just kind of getting into whatever my kids are into in general, which right now is these kind of virtual games. I\u2019ll be honest with you, those kinds of platforms, I\u2019m not so crazy about. But I love spending time with my kids. I kind of just make a point to kind of get into whatever they\u2019re into. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  So, what are your kids\u2019 favorites? \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Oh, man. They\u2019re into Roblox right now. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  You know and Adopt Me is like a game in Roblox and Piggy. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen this. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yes. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  You know, so, it\u2019s those things. And it\u2019s like, okay, well, I guess I have to get into these things to spend time with them. Sometimes I can\u2019t come into their room, I have to come into the virtual server to see them. But I sometimes try to pull them back toward more console-oriented games, too, because that\u2019s kind of my sweet spot. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, it\u2019s really fascinating. Like, my \u2013 I\u2019ve got a 10-year-old and a 12-year-old, and the 10-year-old is, like, a legit Roblox tycoon. He\u2019s learning all sorts of stuff about economics and you know, like, he has this facility with virtual worlds that will go with him the rest of his life. \n\nIt\u2019s really fascinating to hear that your kids are into that, too. It\u2019s an interesting shift. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Yeah, and a sign of the times, for sure. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Well, thank you so much, Ashley, for taking time to chat with us today. And I, like, I\u2019m so glad that you\u2019re here at Microsoft and just can\u2019t wait to be able to work more with you over the coming years. \n\nASHLEY LLORENS:  Likewise, Kevin. Really appreciate the opportunity. Had a lot of fun today. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Awesome. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Well, that was Kevin\u2019s conversation with Ashley Llorens. And I was so fascinated by everything you talked about. First of all, he is brilliant. And as you were kind of saying at the top of the show, it\u2019s really rare that you see someone who has achieved kind of parallel careers in two very different fields, not that there might not be, as you said, kind of a mysterious connection between music and between computer science, but they are on the face of it, how they work, very, very different. I think that\u2019s just so stunning that someone like Ashley exists, honestly. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, and it\u2019s so great to see him have the success that he\u2019s had in both of these things that he has passion about. I think a lot of us get pushed into one direction or the other fairly early in our career. Like, I know you, for instance, like, you are a computer programmer, and you are a writer and a journalist. \n\nAnd, like, those are also two things that look very different from one another on the surface, and I\u2019m guessing that through your career, and I\u2019m guessing Ashley had this as well, and like, I have my own experience with it, like, you get encouraged to, like, \u201cOh, you\u2019ve got to focus, you\u2019ve got to focus, you\u2019ve got to pick one thing.\u201d\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Yeah. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And, like, I always love seeing people like Ashley where it\u2019s, like, no, I actually don\u2019t have to pick one thing. I\u2019m going to do both. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  No. I totally agree. And you\u2019re exactly right. I think most of us, we do have one thing that we have \u2013 we either have to pick or we have to focus more on. And I love that he\u2019s had these parallel careers, but it was really also interesting to me hearing him talk about how at the beginning he tried to keep, you know, his music life separate from his technology work because he wanted to be taken seriously. And I\u2019m glad he doesn\u2019t have to do that anymore, that he can share his full self. \n\nBut it also makes me think, okay, in technology, people really need to be a lot more open-minded about the different backgrounds and interests that people have. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Oh, I could not agree with that more. And, like, when he said that, it really, really, really resonated with me because you know, a little bit of it, I\u2019m guessing, is imposter syndrome and, you know, you sort of feeling very uncomfortable early in your career about whether or not you belong in the \u2013 the place that you\u2019ve chosen to be. \n\nAnd, like, part of it is, like, legitimately these professions, like, have these notions of, you know, this is what it means to be a \u201cblah.\u201d And it\u2019s, you know, whether it\u2019s a medical doctor, lawyer, computer scientist, academic, programmer at a tech company. And the reality is, like, if we were just much more open about things and encouraged people to be their authentic selves early on and like helped them understand that, like, we all feel like imposters at some point or the other that, like, maybe we would, you know, we\u2019d have more people doing more interesting things.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  For sure. And, I mean, I think it also \u2013 and this is really evident in the work that Ashley does, it\u2019s so important in AI to have different perspectives. And I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s amazing that we have someone like him who is an expert in that area who also has different perspectives than other people might, you know, who have come into this because of his curiosity that he was talking about that he\u2019s had since he was a kid. I have a feeling that you would need to be curious to be able to do the things that he does. You need to have that sense of asking why and wanting to learn more. And I love that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, for sure. And I agree. Like, it is critically important in technology in general, and particularly with AI.  \n\nLike, these things that are going to have a high degree of influence over what the future looks like, you just really need a diverse set of people helping you build those things just because the technology itself, has so much impact, like, you want it to be in the hands of as many people as humanly possible. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  For sure. For sure. Well, I loved the conversation, and I can\u2019t wait to see what Ashley does now that he\u2019s at Microsoft. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, me too. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Okay, that\u2019s it for today\u2019s episode. Thank you so much to Ashley for joining us today. And send us a message anytime at BehindTheTech@microsoft.com and be sure to keep listening. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  See you next time. \n\n\n"}
