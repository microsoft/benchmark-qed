{"episode": "EP-29 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Collier Bloomberg", "text": "JACOB COLLIER:  Honestly, I think mastery is a myth. I don\u2019t think it exists. I think that no ideas are ever finished or new. Everything is just recombined. And I love that. Because it means that we get to be artists rather than inventors. We can paint with what we know. And so I guess my job as a musician has been to learn as much as I possibly can. \n\n[MUSIC]\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone.  Welcome to Behind the Tech.  I'm your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we're going to get behind the tech.  We'll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did.  So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what's happening today.  Stick around.  \n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Hello and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Christina Warren, senior cloud advocate at Microsoft.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And I\u2019m Kevin Scott.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  And on to day\u2019s show we have two very special guests. Ben Bloomberg and Grammy-award winning musician Jacob Collier.\n\nAnd for those of you who tune into the show to geek out about tech and AI and you\u2019re thinking, okay, so what does a Grammy-award winning musician have to do with tech. Well, hmm, kind of everything.\n\nJacob Collier is a musical artist that has fully embraced tech as an integral part of the music that he creates and he partnered with MIT\u2019s Ben Bloomberg and the two of them have collaborate to bring their genius into the creation of song and video.\n  \nAnd Kevin, I know that you\u2019ve been so excited for this interview for quite some time.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, I\u2019ve been unbelievably excited. We\u2019ve been trying to get Ben and Jacob on the podcast for a while now, and, you know, I have to say I am an enormous fan of the work that these two do. I think both of them are outrageously talented. \n\nIt\u2019s probably the first podcast that we\u2019re recording where my children are legitimately going to be interested in, you know, in listening to it, because everybody in the house has been bopping around all summer long listening to All I Need. \n\nSo I\u2019m just super excited to chat with these guys about their approach to creativity and, like, how they have very cleverly merged art and technology into a set of creative endeavors that really have, I think, pushed the boundaries of how it is we think about music and live performance. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Absolutely. Absolutely. And I think actually, you know, this might be the sort of thing where the conversation might be so great, that this might even be something that we do in two parts, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, for sure. So, like we will split this conversation with Jacob and Ben into two parts, just so we don\u2019t have to cut short any other conversation.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Absolutely. Well, let\u2019s chat with Jacob and Ben, and this is the first part of that conversation.\n\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Our guests today are Jacob Collier and Ben Bloomberg. Ben is a creative technologist who imagines, designs and builds everything from electroacoustic musical instruments to AI-driven performances and tours. He\u2019s a recent graduate of MIT earning his PhD. \n\nJacob Collier is a multi-Grammy Award-winning instrumentalist, songwriter, arranger and producer based in London. He\u2019s up for three Grammys this year, including Album of the Year. \n\nJacob and Ben began collaborating about seven years ago, partnering to create Jacob\u2019s signature Harmonizer and a truly groundbreaking one-man audiovisual show. Ben and Jacob, welcome!\n\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  Hey, how\u2019s it going?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  I\u2019ve been so excited to have you guys on the show. So, why don\u2019t we start with, with you Ben, actually, like how did you get interested in music and this intersection of music, and technology?\n\n\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  Let\u2019s see, so I \u2013 I grew up in Western Mass, in a town called North Hampton, and in North Hampton, there\u2019s a ton of music. There\u2019s sort of venues \u2013 it\u2019s a small town, but you know, a lot of big names would sort of stop-through. And so from when I was really young, you know, my parents would take me to see, you know, all kinds of people, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Bonnie Raitt. Bob Dylan, even stopped in Northampton one time. And so, I grew up, you know, I grew up with a lot of music, and both my parents are sort of musical and then pretty early on, I got interested in computers, probably starting in fourth grade, and sound too, so I started working with PA systems and running sound for local bands and thing like that, and I was \u2013 I guess I was only nine so I couldn\u2019t even really lift any of the gear at that point, but I would get really into plugging things in, and \u2013 \n\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  I grew up and started getting into all kinds of stuff, building phone systems and running sound and mixing, and got interested in high school in adding sort of computers to live theater, and so I started kind of designing these systems where a computer would sort of centrally control all of the sort of infrastructure in the theater, and we would, we would try to figure out how to sort of tie everything together so that the lighting and the sound was sort of integrated \u2013 and at that point, I started looking for college, you know, college programs that had both good computer science and good sort of live theater. And I found the MIT Media Lab and this group called Opera of the Future. And so that was a graduate program. So, you couldn\u2019t actually major in that as an undergrad, but you \u2013 well, I could work there as sort of an assistant.\n\nAnd so, so I went there, started working, and sort of freshman summer ended up mixing an opera in England for my professor who was Tod Machover, who\u2019s a composer, and so \u2013 this big project with a \u2013 you know, a huge orchestra and a lot of singers, and it was live and my first time sort of on a big mixing desk, and so that kind of, that kind of snowballed and I started doing lots and lots of things, like robot opera.\n\nAnd then 2014 came around, and I saw this video, which was Jacob\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t You Worry about a Thing\u201d video, and then \u201cFascinating Rhythm,\u201d and I was just like blown away, of course, and started showing it to all my friends, and like friends back home in North Hampton, music people and people at MIT, and then, and then one day out of the blue, I just sort of went, \u201cWhat the heck,\u201d and I sent a Facebook message to Jacob, just saying, like, \u201cHey, like your awesome. I\u2019m at MIT, I like to build things. You know, I don\u2019t even have, have anything specific in mind, but if you every want to like talk and build something together, or just think about like what\u2019s possible, that would be so, so cool.\u201d\n\nAnd so, I sent that sort of into the ether, and it \u2013 and didn\u2019t necessarily expect to get anything back, but then a couple weeks later, I got this message back from Jacob. And we had a Skype conversation, and it turned out to be pretty awesome timing because \u2013 and actually, maybe Jacob, you want to take over here, but you had just been offered this crazy show.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  Yeah, absolutely, I had, I had this gig opportunity, kind of like my first-ever gig. Because I\u2019d never really done a gig as Jacob before. I\u2019d made lots of music here in my room, and I\u2019d been sharing it with the world through a different \u2013 a variety of different avenues. But I\u2019d never really done a gig. And so it was this funny moment where I had all of these kinds of arrangements and these songs, and I didn\u2019t have an outfit that would really work on stage, per se.\n\nAnd so here comes this message from Ben, and it was, it was one of those moments from my perspective, where I remember thinking, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what this is, but it just feels right. It feels like it\u2019s the right moment to jump in and see what is possible and what this is about.\u201d I jumped on that Skype call with about \u2013 I don\u2019t about, sort 10 hours\u2019 worth of Google Doc ideas of stuff to build, and stuff to explore, and all that stuff, and Ben was just so incredibly patient with me.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And for folks who may not be familiar with you, like the \u2013 you know, one of the just extraordinary things about what you do in those early YouTube videos is that you have these beautiful, layered, textured performances where you do all the vocals, like this mind-blowing harmony and you play all the instruments. And it\u2019s, it\u2019s a lot of vocals and a lot of instruments, and so I\u2019m guessing translating that to a live performance has to be daunting. Because usually live performance, like you play one instrument, you like \u2013 maybe two, like you have an instrument and your voice.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  Exactly, it was, it was profoundly a challenge. I didn\u2019t know what to do, really, but I knew that I wanted it to reflect, in some way, the process of recording here. And when I record here, I have all these different layers, right, of sounds, instruments, chords, grooves, vocals, whatever, all layering up to make this kind of mosaic, almost like a tapestry of sound, and for those early videos, I would record a video clip of me playing each instrument, and I\u2019d sort of arrange them on the screen in these organized shapes and you\u2019d see the Jacobs as it were, you know, playing all the different ingredients.\n\nAnd so, you know the one of the first questions I had for Ben was \u201cHow is this something that we could translate in a way that\u2019s not going to be a gimmick?\u201d Because a of the sort of live looping gigs that I\u2019ve ever seen, just they don\u2019t feel that great, you know, and it\u2019s a very linear pathway too, to the end of the song. It sort of starts small and builds high, and then you have to press stop, and then everyone claps and you start again. And you know, I think \u2013 I think what I was excited about, and it turned out that Ben was sort of incredibly in line with this, was the human experience, something that felt like the music had multiple limbs, more limbs than I physically have, but still felt like it was an expression of one person, one thing.\n\nMuch later, slowly but surely, into this idea of what a one-man show might look and feel like, and how on earth you go about designing that. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, and I saw an interview of you on the  Harry Connick Show, where I don\u2019t know whether you had the Harmoniser at that point, but like on that show you were sort of frantically running around, from like one instrument to another, like trying to like make this performance with all of the tools, but like there wasn\u2019t \u2013 there wasn\u2019t a simultaneity about it, like did you have the harmonizer at that point?\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  I believe so. I think the Harmoniser is pretty much the first thing that we dreamed up and built together. And Ben, I remember coming to your place. It literally would have been six years ago, I think like almost to the day, actually, and I stopped by, and we started this thing. Because you know, as you mentioned, Kevin, one of the things I love to do most is multiple voices, and so kind of like 101 dream on stage was to be able to sing multiple-voice harmonies spontaneously, you know, and not need to loop myself and stop time, or press play on a track, and all this stuff, that sort of felt like it wasn\u2019t really spontaneous.\n\nAnd so, in my mind, there was this way of me standing on stage and playing the notes I want to hear my voice sing, and then you hearing all of those notes sung by my voice in real time as a sound producer. That was the thing that we sat down on your couch, Ben, and sort of dreamed up, and we made really early version in about five hours that we kind of chipped away at, and then I ended up going home, and I came back to finish it a couple of months later.\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  So Ben, maybe you can explain what the harmonizer is and like, and I really want to hear about how you \u2013 like this is not a trivial piece of technology. I want to understand how you got the prototype done in five hours. That sounds very impressive. \n\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  I think the, the key thing, especially when you\u2019re trying to build these prototypes is sort of not to get wrapped up in implementation details. And so when we were trying to build it, we really just wanted to get as quickly as we could to something that felt really good. And so you know it wasn\u2019t about necessarily like we\u2019re going to try this weird algorithm, or we\u2019re going to do that thing. It\u2019s just like, well, what do we have at our fingertips right now that we like, and what can we sort of combine together in a way \u2013 you know, maybe we like these qualities of it, but we don\u2019t like this thing of it, so we\u2019ll \u2013 you know, we\u2019ll work on customizing something, and I \u2013 you know, I think, I think with these performance systems, a lot people sort of have this idea that like we\u2019re going to build everything from scratch, and actually that gets pretty scary when you have a huge audience and things like that. So, yeah, we \u2013 I remember, Jacob, you brought this thing called TC Helicon VoiceLive 2 Touch, which is sort of a classic kind low-coding harmonizer, and we tried it out, and thought, \u201cOkay, yeah, this is great, but it only plays four notes.\u201d \n\nSo, like that\u2019s not enough notes for Jacob. And so, we should add more notes, and how can we do that? And so, a lot of that first day was just trying to figure out how to take a bunch of four-note harmonizers and allow us to have let\u2019s say 12 notes or 16 notes. And then we started thinking about sort of the quality of each of the voices in the Harmoniser, and so most harmonizers, you know, they\u2019ll have some attack and decay for each voice, and a lot of the ones that we found, we didn\u2019t quite like that envelope, and Jacob wanted to play so quickly. \n\nA lot of the harmonizers had like a little fadeout, a little decay. So then a big part of it was figuring out how to get each voice to stop, like instantly, after we \u2013 you know, after Jacob would release a key. And then we started looking at latency, because again, with a harmonizer, you want to be able to sort of be nimble and have lots of sort of agility in terms of the notes that are being played and everything. So, we then tried to figure out how to do something that was sort of as low latency as possible. \n\nAnd so, you know, we started taking a lot of parts and basically combining them together, and some of it was running on the computer. We had, you know, in the end we had the TC Helicon in there too, but we like, we modified it a little bit, and it ended up sort of in this 3D printed enclosure with some custom sort of analog stuff on the frontend. And that would sort of be triggered for certain parts, and then things in the computer would be triggered for other note ranges. And then because we were running the computer in there, we could sort of do it like a studio mix where we would have you know lots and lots of sort of processing all of the voices, and then processing on the whole stereo mix. So we were able to sort of control dynamics that way, and make it so that low voices were sort of in the center, and high voices spread out.\n\nAnd so, you know, it\u2019s sort of all these little details. And it\u2019s really about figuring out how to get the feel to be sort of what we want. And then the hardest part actually is just making it so that it doesn\u2019t break when you\u2019re trying to use it on stage, and it gets dumped off the back of a truck or you know whatever, whatever happens on tour and checked as checked baggage. And in some ways, that\u2019s the hardest thing because it\u2019s just incredibly hard to make really, really rugged, really rugged gear.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Have you, so this is a weird tangent, but have either of you watched the Wintergatan videos, the Marble Machine videos? Like that looks like the most fragile like machine I\u2019ve ever seen. Like I don\u2019t know how Martin kept the thing together for the tour that he was on.\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  It, that kind of stuff is super scary. And actually when we started working together I had just finished this robot opera which was \u2013 it\u2019s a long story, but it was commissioned as a birthday present for the Prince of Monaco, and we did, we did this crazy production, you know, sort of Broadway scale with all these \u2013 you know, it was three 50-foot trailers of gear, and it was all custom hardware, all sort of custom robots that had been built from scratch at the Media Lab. And just seeing all that hardware sort of on tour, and seeing all the really scary moments when things would fall apart, or catch on fire, or almost squish somebody, or \u2013 you know, and it was an amazing show. But if it was just going to be the two of us, and just starting out, I think when we started working together, I was sort of really sensitive to that. \n\nSo, we were, we were really cautious at the beginning, and I think we\u2019ve gotten sort of more and more adventurous as time, as time goes. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  You know, what I\u2019ve done over the years with technology, like you\u2019re sort of building things, and you\u2019ve got billions of people who use it, and so you\u2019re like constantly worried about the fragility of things, and robustness and fault tolerance and reliability and whatnot, because you know, the consequences of something failing are \u2013 like you just impact a lot of people. For you all, it seems to me that, you know, one of the special things about what you do with music is that, you know, done well, like you are completely capturing someone in this immersive emotional state, and like mistakes, you know, like a cough, or like there are very easy ways to sort of pull you out of that immersion, and so like in that sense, like the stuff really has to be robust, right?\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  I think it\u2019s a mixture of things being robust, and then leaving space for being spontaneous, you know. And I think that this is something that I\u2019m kind of forever indebted to Ben doing, was on that first Skype conversation, and in those kind of initial dreaming phases of the one-man show and the Harmoniser and all sorts of other things, there was never a moment where it was kind of like, \u201cOh, no, no, that\u2019s too \u2013 we can\u2019t do that, that\u2019s going to be too fragile, or that\u2019s not going to work out, or that\u2019s not reasonable for you to be expecting\u201d \u2013 you know, whatever. It was like, well, if it\u2019s not possible, then we\u2019ll find a way to make it possible. \n\nAnd then I came to trust that process, not necessarily to end up where I was expecting it to, but you know, there are a few different examples of things where we\u2019d set out thinking I want to be able to do this live, and then by the time we do it live it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s changed its nature. \n\nI mean, I remember when we started with the one-man show, having about 10 different foot pedals across the whole stage. And I had to run around, hitting all the pedals as I would play each instrument, and then spring away from that instrument, but I figured out \u2013 well, what we figured out in trials was that if I hit that pedal, even a fraction of a second after the downbeat, it would loop the following bar, you know. And so there\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s only so much processing that my mind can do in one go about when I hit a button, and also how \u2013 there\u2019s also only so much I can do physically with my body on stage, at one moment, and still be a human and musical and give energy to a room. And so you know, that\u2019s something that we \u2013 you know, we kind of looked at each other and said, \u201cYou know what, maybe we should just lose the pedals,\u201d and let\u2019s have the loop \u2013 the loop invisibly, and let\u2019s just tell them when to start and stop looping. And then my job would be to land, to sort of just land in front of them at the right moment in the song, play them for the right length of time, and call that in my head, and run away and keep playing.\n\nAnd so you know, things \u2013 things do change, but I think that the thing about Ben is that there is always space for an idea to kind of be impossible for a little bit because there\u2019s a very important fragile moment when an idea is being had where you can\u2019t stamp on it and be too realistic. You have to dream. You have to say, this \u2013 no one could ever do this, okay, let\u2019s go and do it, you know, and then obviously once you get started that\u2019s when kind of my wealth of experience of being guiding by what\u2019s my idea of good and bad creatively steps in, and Ben\u2019s massive wealth of experience about how things work the best, and what things work well, and what is a no-no, and what is a yes, those kind of come into fruition, you know, but there\u2019s that, that lovely \u2013 there\u2019s that lovely moment at the beginning where you just think, \u201cWhoa, yeah, we could do this.\u201d\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG: We can do it, let\u2019s go for it. \n\nJACOB COLLIER:  I\u2019m curious, Kevin, actually, to ask you, as somebody who is so successfully \u2013 sort of had ideas and implemented them. How do you have ideas, and how do you assemble people around you to help those ideas come to life, where the idea can be as sort of safe but yet impossible as it needs to be to be a good idea?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, I think it\u2019s really, really \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s sort of the hardest thing about creativity, right? Especially--so, with engineers, you know, I think there\u2019s this mindset thing that maybe you\u2019re even born with where you sort of look at the world in terms of like all of the things that are wrong. So you\u2019re just sort of constantly scanning things. It\u2019s like, oh, this doesn\u2019t work as well as it could, and you know, like this is broken and needs to be fixed, which is a \u2013 you know, both a good and a bad thing. It\u2019s like a slightly jaundiced, you know, worldview, but it\u2019s also the thing that results in like \u2013 you know, this determination and drive to go like make things better.\n\nAnd I think there\u2019s this moment when you get a bunch of technical or creative people in the room and they come to a problem with this, they\u2019ve got this set of tools that they have, like they have an understanding of, like how the world works, which is just that understanding at a point in time. And they have you know, they have their experiences about what they\u2019ve tried in the past and which things have worked and which haven\u2019t. And like it\u2019s sort of hard at the beginning, I think, to overcome everyone\u2019s past. \n\nSo, because you\u2019ll have a lot of people in the room who are like, \u201cOh, you can\u2019t do that, that\u2019s going to be too hard. That\u2019s impossible. Like, I don\u2019t know how to do that.\u201d And the thing that you have to do is figure out inside of those groups how you can how you can give people the permission to speak the daring, crazy thing and not immediately get shot down. Where they feel safe, it\u2019s like, oh no, you just don\u2019t want to tell people that idea\u2019s stupid. So, like part of it is about language and culture.\n\nLike one of the ways that we really admire the growth mindset work out of this brilliant professor at Stanford. And one of the things that we tell everyone is --we don\u2019t want to be know-it-alls, we want to be learn-it-alls. And so if you think about all of as like a learning experience, it\u2019s you have an objective in mind. And like the process of like going towards the objective is learning how to get there, then you sort of wash away a bunch of this sort of cultural stuff that can blow ideas apart before you ever really understand whether they\u2019re going to work or not. And I\u2019m guessing that that sounds like you all sort of approach things very similarly.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  Yeah, I would say I would definitely say so. And it\u2019s lovely to hear you talk in those terms. When Ben and I, you know, for example, set out after doing this first show, which is the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, we were opening up for Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea. And there were three thousand people who we had never heard of me or anything or which is completely it was completely new for me and for everyone.\n\nYou know having done that gig, we set out on this tour, you know, our first tour ever. And it\u2019s crazy, and the objective of that, you know, if you think about it in those terms was kind of unclear. You know, we wanted to have a good time, and we wanted to play music, and we wanted to make people happy, but we didn\u2019t really know past that like what exactly wanted it to be like and feel and represent. You know, we didn\u2019t know why we were doing it. There wasn\u2019t really a reason that we were doing it, other than it just felt like the right moment to do it. And so Ben and I set out for a month of shows, maybe about 20 shows. And we had eight bags between the two of us, and that meant that we each had to carry four, and so we \u2013 I can clearly remember having a huge suitcase in my left hand, a huge suitcase in my right hand and then a great big like rucksack on my back, with all my gear, all the computers and stuff in it, and then on my front this stick base, the like double base in a case that goes on a stand, and Ben was kind of equivalently bestowed.\n\nAnd we would be waddling around the States, and we wandered around the whole of the U.S. and stayed on friends\u2019 couches and all sorts of things. And just feeling out what was good and what we loved the most, and sort of building around that. And even over the course of that one tour, there were lots of different things that we changed. \n\nAnd I think for me, having been used to a very kind of quick process of manifesting something that I liked in a recording environment, you know, it takes me 2.5 seconds to change my mind and start something fresh. On the road it happens at a different speed. And I guess, Ben, I\u2019m interested to hear your thoughts on what this has been like for you and continues to be like. But you know, at the end of every show I\u2019d say, \u201cAll right, we need to change these six things about these six songs, and we\u2019re going to change the whole structure and remove the \u2013 let\u2019s speed this one up, change the key of this one.\u201d And Ben was really good at kind of \u2013 from my perspective, of letting me do that kind of processing, but also grounding me in the idea that we were building a show that had to run every night, and that if we changed everything about every show, every night, and you\u2019re kind of starting from scratch. And so there was a real kind of mutual patience that I think that we had to have about how that process evolved, and our sort of goal of working together, sort of emerged slightly further, the more steps we put in the line, you know. But Ben, do you want to talk to that at all?\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  You know I think what\u2019s really interesting, especially sort of in the world of live performances. Generally, people are really risk averse, and so every venue you go to, every house crew that you work with, people are \u2013 you know, people\u2019s sort of reputations and everything is sort of dependent on who the show goes. And so, you know I think what we\u2019ve evolved towards now is just starting the conversation. You know, every single time we go into a venue saying, \u201cYou know, look, let\u2019s try if we can to set aside all of our sort of preconceived notions about what a show is and how you normally use your equipment and things like that.\u201d And let\u2019s \u2013 you know, and it\u2019s actually like in big bold letters on the front of the rider, that says like \u201cThis isn\u2019t a normal show.\u201d You know, and let\u2019s sort of work from base principles here and so I think that sort of \u2013 I don\u2019t know, mindset is what has really sort of pervaded and sort of evolved, and it took me a little bit. \n\nYou know, I think Jacob, you know, you definitely stretched me a lot. Because you know at the very beginning it would be like \u201cOh, my god, like we can\u2019t change that,\u201d you know, between the shows. I remember, actually, the very first show at Ronnie Scott\u2019s, which we actually did as a rehearsal show before the big Montreux show, and it was like five minutes before the show started, and Jacob came up to me and said, \u201cWe need to change the playback,\u201d or we need to change \u2013 I forget exactly what it was, and I said, like, \u201cNo, no, we can\u2019t change the playback right now.\u201d And it was like the very first \u2013 you know, it was sort of the very first like sort of moment where we sort of had to say, okay, like \u2013 you know, we could change it, but every time we\u2019ve changed something, there\u2019s been a problem. And maybe we\u2019ll get good at changing things down the road, and really flexible. But so far every time we\u2019ve changed something there\u2019s been like a little hiccup, so we could change it, but there might be a little hiccup. We just don\u2019t know and we can\u2019t test, so like what should we do, you know.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Well, I can say, and what I\u2019ve always tried to do with the technology products that my teams and I have built is that you\u2019ve sort of got these two things. One is like the faster and higher quality you can gather feedback, the quicker you can learn and the better you can make the thing that you\u2019re trying to produce. And so engineering your environment in a way where you can get that high-quality feedback as quickly as possible is like super important. So like that\u2019s one thing. And then the other thing is, you know, if you are thoughtful enough, you can usually understand the sorts of risks that you need to be able to take. And then you build some systems to help you manage those risks, so that you can like walk right up to the edge of something, and even allow yourself to fail.\n\nLike a thing that we have in operations is this thing called MTTR, mean time to recovery. So, with software, I mean, like both of you know this, like there\u2019s no way to produce bug-free software. Like it is literally, from a theory of computation perspective it is-- these are undecidable problems like you can\u2019t compute a solution to them, no matter how powerful a machine you have. And so you have to reconcile yourself to the fact that you\u2019re going to produce things that will have errors in them. And so the question then becomes how do you catch as many errors as humanly possible before you throw something out into the world. And then like how \u2013 once, you know, knowing full well that things are going to get through, like how do you build your systems so that you can recover from failures quickly. And that is, software for products, like that\u2019s a very useful way to think about the world, like it just lets you move faster than you otherwise would if you are constantly being crippled by the fear that you\u2019re going to fail.\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  I think that\u2019s really important, and what\u2019s so special about Jacob is \u2013 you know, for all that the technology does, we really do have a lot of \u2013 we really do have a lot of wiggle room because Jacob on stage can make just about anything, you know, feel amazing, and so \u2013 you know, there have been some pretty ridiculous sort of \u2013 I won\u2019t call them failures, but moments where things didn\u2019t quite go as expected. And if were anybody else, it would \u2013 you know, it would have been sort of a train wreck, and Jacob is able to take, you know, even the craziest things. \n\nI think like one time in Germany, all the loopers started speeding up and going up in pitch because one of the video operators pushed the wrong button at the wrong time. And like nobody else can handle that stuff, but Jacob can make that sound musical and you know keep the audience having a good time. So, I think in that respect we were sort of really uniquely positioned to try out some pretty risk stuff. You know, he kind of makes it possible.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  I guess I could tell, just one thing from my perspective on that, would be that I think Ben and I have different kind of values, the different \u2013 different experiential values of control, and when control is necessary. And you know, so I know for example that when it comes to precision of musical information, I\u2019m quite \u2013 I\u2019m quite controlled because I kind of tend to know the highest resolution position for this note to be for it to mean the most in the groove for example. And I think less about you know things like \u2013 you know is this flow \u2013 is the flowchart from the element to this element within the tech going to work every night in a way that means I can \u2013 that we can all have a good time?\n\nAnd I guess that means that there are elements of the tech which I\u2019m stretching from my perspective, and absolutely the same in reverse, where you know \u2013 Ben for example will be very, very risk aware in some scenarios, but then will also highly encourage me to jump off my own creative rails in a musical sense and try new stuff the whole time, you know. And I think if there\u2019s one thing that comes from making music in one room for ten years and then going on the road, having never done a gig, you know, I don\u2019t tend to think about imperfections being great. You know, I tend to think about imperfections that aren\u2019t to plan being things that I will kind of want to correct and make sure that they are right. \n\nIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re going to be completely in a grid-based system all the time, but it\u2019s where I want it, you know. But one thing that I \u2013 you know, that I at first was very kind of \u2013 I guess I was quite intimidated with touring, and now I\u2019m completely in love with about touring is that it\u2019s one of the only moments of your life where you have no room to be anything other than just present. You just have to be present. And so a lot of the mistakes and the imperfections we\u2019ve ended up designing the whole show to let those shine even more than we used to, you know. And so I used to think that the best gigs we did were the one-man show , or the gigs where I nailed all the instruments, but it\u2019s just not true. \n\nAnd I know you were saying about an environment where you can get instantaneous feedback, I mean, for me, that\u2019s just going on tour. And every \u2013 every night where we got a fresh round of feedback, and it doesn\u2019t matter, it doesn\u2019t really matter what the audience says to you after the show. You know, they might say, \u201cOh, that was a great show, we loved it.\u201d Or \u201cIt was rubbish.\u201d You know but you tend to sense, just even standing on the stage and being you on stage how that is going down, and so I think, it was a real kind of quick learning process of people immediately responded to the moments where I wasn\u2019t impossibly perfect at something, you know, impossibly good at something, the moments where there would be space for me to be \u2013 you know, wiggle around, or something would go wrong.\n\nI can think of gigs where, you know, someone would cough, and it would loop, every time, it would loop, as part of the loop [coughing] \u2013 you know, in the percussion loop because it was really quiet and someone would yell or scream or a plane would go overhead, or whatever. That would get, that would become part of the groove of the song. And that\u2019s a fabulous challenge, musically, how do you make that make sense, but you have to be willing to look a little bit like a fool, and just sort of embrace it, and I think for me one thing I\u2019ve learned really is how special it can be when everyone is kind of doing that together, you know, the audience and performer alike are both coping with the strange curveball, and alchemizing it into something that feels really, really great, you know?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, so I mean, I love to like \u2013 to sort of press on this a little bit because I can\u2019t tell whether these two things are different. So, you have these amazing performances that you do in front of audiences that feel to me at least like they have this very improvisational character to them. And then I watched you do things like your \u201cI Harm You\u201d videos where someone will send you a melody or a tune and like you create this harmonic texture around it. And like I\u2019ve seen \u2013 you know, you sit there for hours sometimes in front of Logic Pro, and you know, you\u2019ve got hundreds of tracks and like you \u2013 I mean, like your process if fascinating to me because you just, you tweak and tune. And like on the surface that seems like it\u2019s a different thing than the \u2013 you know, than the life performances, but like maybe it\u2019s just \u2013 you know, the same thing on a \u2013 on the same continuum.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  I would say it definitely is the same thing. It\u2019s a similar expression on a different scale of time, I guess, you know. You could say one is real time and one is stop time, but they\u2019re both kind of improvisations. And in some ways, we\u2019re doing the same thing right now just as we\u2019re having a conversation. It\u2019s like we, I\u2019ve internalized enough of a vocabulary to kind of explain a bit about what I\u2019ve done, or what I\u2019m thinking or what I like, or whatever, and that happens kind of in a way that\u2019s new every time. There\u2019s a scenario in which it\u2019s reasonable for me to do that. But I think for me I used to think they were very different. I used to think, \u201cWell, oh I\u2019ll be recording in my room, and then I\u2019ll go and talk as \u2013 you know, touring, that\u2019s fine, and then I\u2019ll come back home and really continue doing what I love to do.\u201d And then you realize it\u2019s the same, it\u2019s the same thing. It\u2019s like a different limb of the same beast, you know, where you\u2019re making an idea happen at a speed \u2013 at the speed at which you\u2019re having it, you know. And when you\u2019re in a studio that speed is in some ways slower than when you\u2019re on the stage, and if I\u2019m on the stage at the piano, then I\u2019m playing as I\u2019m thinking, and I\u2019m jumping through hoops as I find the hoops, you know?\n\nAnd in the studio, the whole process kind of takes longer to occur. And if I imagine an orchestra in my mind, I can\u2019t play the whole orchestra into Logic at once, but I can play each instrument at a time and build up the layers. And that kind of concept of visualizing and executing is very similar. But I think that you need a different set of tools in different situations to do that. You know, I\u2019ve recorded this album, Djesse Vol. 3, this \u2013 last year, in 2020, as part of my quadruple Djesse albums, it\u2019s a four-album series. And Ben and I did a lot of sort of sonic sculpting and mixing on this album, and more than ever, I\u2019ve learned from Ben the value of listening to sounds from a very different perspective than I\u2019m used to, because when I listen to a sound, I hear it as music, and a piece of musical information, which is not the perspective that always makes sense.\n\nFor example, in the mastering process or the mixing process, or the spatializing process, or whatever it happens to be. And so Ben has been able to lend me his perspective, you know, one of many, many perspectives that I\u2019ve learned from, about how it\u2019s possible to experience something in a new way, which changes the way that I look at something, which is really valuable.  So that the skill for example of getting something to sit in a space, it \u2013 when you\u2019re wearing headphones is a different skill that applies whether it\u2019s an E flat or an E natural that needs to be in this F major chord, you know. \n\nBut the expression of something, that the spirit of something kind of being manifested, I think is \u2013 I think it\u2019s the same. And I would say that, you know, whether we\u2019re sitting down building tech, or whether we\u2019re on stage improvising with an audience, or whether we\u2019re recording in the studio or collaborating with another artist, or whatever, there\u2019s normally a sense of push and pull, and you normally bring a set of values in. But I guess I would concur with your \u2013 rather than being know-it-alls be learn-it-alls thing, where you have to kind of walk in with a blank canvas each time you step into anything, and just have some kind of faith that you, that it will be fine, you know. And I think that\u2019s something that Ben and I have had to learn and have learned probably from each other about just executing thing after thing.\n\nBecause after a while you think, \u201cWell, you know, maybe we can stretch this even further because what\u2019s the worst that could happen, you know, the worse that could happen is that everything breaks and then you just play the piano\u201d you know, and there\u2019s a joy in letting go of the risk of that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  So, one of the things that I find super inspirational about both of you is what you do is such a multidisciplinary, multiskilled thing. And like you have these collections of skills. And you know, I think one of the like really interesting things about these like crafts or arts that require a lot of technique is when you do it well, you know, it \u2013 people don\u2019t really see like all of the struggle and the challenge and the difficulty of mastering the skills. And you know, with Ben, you know, you know, it\u2019s software, it\u2019s you know, and like a particular software, like you know, you probably understand signal processing extremely well, which is like very mathematical, like you were talking about in the Harmoniser. You\u2019re doing stuff with 3D printing, you\u2019ve got analog circuits in this thing, like you \u2013 so, you know, you have accumulated this giant bag of skills to go do something. Like Jacob\u2026so I have this guy works with me Jaron Lanier, who was like the father of virtual reality, who is like also these polymaths sorts, like he plays like crazy range of instruments and actually has one of the largest, I think the largest collection of \u2013 private collection of musical instruments in the world. \n\nBut like you sort of play everything, and it\u2019s not just the instruments, it\u2019s like your voice is just what you can do with it. And then you have this, you know, the music theory that you have at your disposal. And then you\u2019ve got these tools like not just Logic Pro for composing the music, but like you just sort of figured out, like, I don\u2019t know whether it was intentionally or accidentally that you can use the internet and YouTube and like all of these things to collaborate with people. When did both of you decide that accumulating like all of these things, each of which requires serious effort to master that that was worth doing on such a broad scale?\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  That\u2019s a tough one. Like I don\u2019t know if you feel this way, Jacob, but I would say, I don\u2019t necessarily feel like I have mastered anything. I think, we definitely do a lot. I sort of \u2013 I sort of feel like we\u2019re guided by not \u2013 not like wanting to accumulate these skills or find new things to explore, but it\u2019s just sort of in the moment, like, \u201cOh, yeah, we want to make a music video,\u201d so we have to learn about, you know, raw camera, post processing workflow, and you know, cinema lenses and things. And it\u2019s just like, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll do a little bit of googling.\u201d Like today I have to calculate, you know, if we\u2019re going to shoot this video, how can we fit four Jacobs in the frame with this specific lens and that specific sensor, and it\u2019s just sort of--well, we\u2019ve already talked about it, it\u2019s what Jacob said, you know, it\u2019s the sort of, \u201cWell, we can do this,\u201d you know, and let\u2019s just take this risk and let\u2019s have fun, and this isn\u2019t intimidating, it\u2019s sort of a fun new world to explore. And I think we do that sort of over and over. I don\u2019t know, what do you think Jacob?\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  I completely I agree. I mean, I think \u2013 I mean, everyone is a fraud, right? No one really knows what they\u2019re doing in anything at all. I definitely feel the same as Ben in the sense that there\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve mastered, you know, and I honestly, I think mastery is a myth. I don\u2019t think it exists. I think that no ideas are ever finished or new. Everything is just recombined. And I love that. Because it means that we get to be artists rather than inventors. We can paint with what we know. And so I guess my job as a musician has been to learn as much as I possibly can. And I never stop to think about learning. I just learned it because, well, of course I\u2019m going to, of course I want to understand how, why this works here. Or, well of course, it needs to be further to the left in the frame. Or, well, of course, I need to be able to sing on stage in multiple voices. Let\u2019s just do it, you know, because there was never a moment where I thought, \u201cWell, no, I shouldn\u2019t be doing it, or I can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nI think that there\u2019s a certain attitude of just kind of believing that it\u2019s going to be fine, that enables things to happen. Which is one of the reasons I was so curious about your process, Kevin, within teams. But I think for me I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t see anyone at school, growing up, who could play the bass, or the drums or the guitar in the way that I wanted to hear them being played. There were lots of great musicians, but I wanted to hear a particular thing, and I figured that, not for any kind of particular reason, other than just I wanted to be efficient. I figured, well, I may as well do it myself, because I know what I want more than anyone else knows what I want. And so \u2013 and that\u2019s kind of a positive and quite relaxing realization. It\u2019s like, well, okay, then I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019m not going to do it in a \u2013 in the right way, probably, or the way that\u2019s right by the rules, but you know, I love to bend stuff. \n\nAnd it\u2019s funny when you\u2019re looking at the industry, at the music industry, and it\u2019s filled with people who are really trying desperately to imitate each other so that they may compete on the same kind of \u2013 on this well-trodden scale of hip and cool and accessible and sure, and over-compressed and stuff, and you sort of think, well, if I assume I\u2019m going to have fun making music, then I might just make my own path that\u2019s a different one from that because then I\u2019m always going to be where I need to be on it. And there\u2019s no kind of moment where I think, \u201cWell, surely the right way of doing it is not there, so surely it\u2019s x, y and z that would be more appropriate for this, that and the other.\u201d And so I\u2019m not a brilliant piano player or bass player or drummer or singer or anything, or arranger or video editor or whatever. But I do trust my intuition to kind of lead me in the right direction, and I guess in some ways saying, you know, is recording a song at home the same process as performing on stage? I guess it\u2019s the same as if I play the piano, is it the same as playing the guitar? \n\nWell, no, it\u2019s not the same. But it\u2019s still, it\u2019s a different dialect of a similar thing, which is kind of like believing that you\u2019ll learning something, you can learn something from everything you ever do, and that you\u2019re willing to do it, you know, and that you\u2019re willing to put yourself on the line and sort of embrace it. And I don\u2019t think about my skills as individual at all. And I know Ben is the same, and you know, there are so many things that Ben can do, but he \u2013 I doubt you\u2019d say, \u201cWell, I can do this, this and this,\u201d you know, because they\u2019re all kind of different strings to the bow, you know. And I think that in some ways, that\u2019s what people are, but we have a society and a culture where we kind of tend to say, \u201cI do this, and this is me at my top level. I am a musician,\u201d you know, but \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:   Look, I think what you just said is, it\u2019s a very, very important mindset because, look, the reality is like you may not feel like you\u2019re a master at these individual things, but there \u2013 you know, there is like a threshold, right, of playing the piano, or playing the guitar, where like you start and like what you\u2019re getting out of the instrument is not worthy of sharing with anyone else, like you\u2019ve got to do work to like get the notes into your fingers, like where you can, you know, perform what you have in your imagination.\n\nBut it sounds to me like both of you sort of look at these things as like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not going to sit down at the piano and practice for three hours a day because, like, I need to get to level ten on the piano mastery chart.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cNo, this is part of a thing that I want to do or that I\u2019m intensely curious about. And like, I\u2019m just going to, I\u2019m just going to play and practice until I get it to where I need it to be for this thing that I\u2019m trying to achieve.\u201d\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  I think you\u2019re so right. I remember two things. One is I remember my mom offering me piano lessons when I was eight years old because all I would do all day long, is sit at the piano and play cluster chords, you know, [mimics chords], wow, cool! And I remember my mom saying, \u201cDo you want piano lessons,\u201d and I remember just saying, \u201cNo I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want piano lessons at all, actually,\u201d because I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m just going to go at my own, my own pace, and I don\u2019t really want to be the best piano player, you know, I just want to be the best at being Jacob that I can possibly be. And she was really kind of with me on that, and I\u2019m very, very grateful to her. \n\nThe other thing I was going to say was when I started making videos, I realized that in order to play them for the camera, I had to learn how to play them. Because I would record these baselines, and I remember, back in the day, you know, recording one note at the time, and editing it into the place where it sounded funky, you know. Because I couldn\u2019t play it, but I knew I wanted it to go [mimics the music], you know, and so I would go [mimics music] and then [mimics music] and then [mimics music] and I\u2019d edit to go [mimics music]. And that was fine, you know, and obviously it\u2019s \u2013 you know, you\u2019d think, \u201cOh, that\u2019s not the way it should be done.\u201d But then I\u2019d turn the camera on to do that take, and I just had to, I had to get it together, and so I did, you know? And at that point it wasn\u2019t a matter of, oh, am I good enough, you know, should \u2013 am I really qualified enough to be playing the \u2013 you know, it was just, well, I\u2019ve got such a defined objective that there\u2019s no possible way I\u2019m not going to get this together because I have to. And so there was something really joyous about that for me. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. And I think everyone listening should like relisten to that ten times because that mindset that, you know, having something in mind that you want to do, being fearless about like that you\u2019re going to be able to figure out how to like put all of the skill together to accomplish the thing, and then just joyously pursuing it is the way that I think you make great things.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  I\u2019d say so. Absolutely.\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  You know it is, it easy for us to say that because we\u2019re doing \u2013 you know, I think we\u2019re all doing pretty crazy stuff right now, you know, and \u2013 but, and it\u2019s the hardest to do that when you\u2019re just starting, right. But I think, especially for Jacob and I, we sort of owe that to our families, actually, because it\u2019s sort of our families that were there at the beginning when maybe we were just playing single notes, or like \u2013 you know, when I was building a phone system and my parents were like, \u201cWell, are we still going to be able to call 9-1-1 if you\u2019re like taking all over the phones in our house?\u201d you know. And so, sort of the trust and the support there, I think we\u2019re both really lucky, and now we\u2019re sort of fearless, but it\u2019s this self-fulfilling process.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s sort of you do it once, and then it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, wow, that felt good, like let\u2019s try something crazier.\u201d And like that\u2019s why, you know, this most recent \u2013 like Jimmy Fallon thing, for example, where we\u2019re both like doing things that we\u2019ve never done before, you know, and the end result has to like be submitted for primetime television, you know. And it worked out in the end, which is a crazy thing, and another good feeling, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  We\u2019ve had this interesting thing going on over the past year, with the pandemic where everybody is distant from one another physically. And we\u2019re all trying to work from home, and it seems like there\u2019s some really cool artistic stuff happening from that. So, like you have what you\u2019ve been doing with Djesse Vol. 3, and like Taylor Swift has put out two albums, and you know, like people are like sort of exploring new ways to like make art and be creative, that I think is really, really amazing.\n\nAnd like one of the interesting things, like I know you\u2019re up for Album of the year, actually against, you know, Taylor Swift, not that it\u2019s any sort of like against or competition or whatnot, it\u2019s sort of a joyous thing that you\u2019re both nominated and like you both made beautiful things. But like the things that you\u2019ve made are very different. Like hers, like and I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ve seen the documentary she made about her album that\u2019s on Disney Plus, but it\u2019s like this beautiful, wistful, like almost melancholy thing. It\u2019s almost like she\u2019s sort of taken this, you know, sort of moment with the pandemic where like you\u2019re a little bit isolated, or isolated in a way that you weren\u2019t before, and just like gone inwards, and it\u2019s like very thoughtful, and you know and reflective.\n\nAnd like what you\u2019ve done is like it seems to me like you\u2019ve figured out new ways to connect with people and like what you\u2019re producing is joyous, I mean like really joyous, I mean like I\u2019ve been \u2013 I\u2019ve listened to your music so much over the pandemic because it just makes my mood better. And like you\u2019ve collaborated with all these amazing people, and like you\u2019re staging these performances, whether it\u2019s like the BBC, or CBC Sunday Morning or Jimmy Fallon, like you\u2019ve just figured out how to do this pandemic thing in a joyous way. Like how, like is that deliberate or like just \u2013 you know, just you\u2019re just \u2013 you know, trucking on, keep being Jacob?\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  I mean, it hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, you know, and I think we\u2019ve all had different struggles at different moments. I think there was a kind of natural momentum that I found going into March where I had all of these kind of ideas and energy. And we were just about to go on tour, actually. And it was this crazy moment where four days before the rehearsal started and it was sort of like, this is not happening. You have to go home now and stay at home. And I\u2019d been running for two or three years through this kind of seemingly never-ending tunnel of like thing that\u2019s very intense that I have to do right now and never any space to think about anything else. And I remember when I heard the news that the tour wasn\u2019t going to go ahead, my biggest kind of emotion was \u2013 in some ways was relief. It was like, \u201cWow, that means that I don\u2019t have to go on tour.\u201d And I was devastated about not going on tour. But that means that no one knows what\u2019s going on right now. And that was for me was a really interesting moment because you have to recalibrate. And what I find is that if I get \u2013 if you just give something space, then it will grow.\n\n\nAnd I\u2019ve also been very, very lucky, I guess as Ben said, with my family, you know, because my space \u2013 my family are automatically very kind of nurturing towards space and time. And so what it meant was I was able to spend time with those guys and just dream up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t had time to dream about. And I mean, I definitely didn\u2019t plan it out. I didn\u2019t think, oh, well, what the world needs \u2013 you know, because I\u2019ve looked at the numbers and everything, there needs to be joyous, and so I\u2019m going to be joyous, you know. But I think that I was determined to make \u2013 to give myself challenges to grow through, because that\u2019s what sustains me as a human. And I was determined to connect with people because that also sustains me as a human. And I was relieved to have more time to work on the album, which I\u2019ve been on for some time, but you know, looking back now, I know it was nowhere near ready, back in March and I \u2013 it was technically finished so that I could go on tour and release it, but it was not finished. And so I\u2019m really, really grateful for the time. But you know, it\u2019s really hard to maintain perspective. And you know, we\u2019ve had highs and lows at different times, and \u2013 yeah, but you know, Ben and I have kind of never been closer, despite having not seen each other for a year.\n\nYou know, we\u2019ve done crazy stuff together. You know, we\u2019ve done all these shows, you know, 350 gigs. And we\u2019ve made four albums, and all this stuff, but actually it\u2019s been this distanced time with a little bit of perspective where we start asking each other the questions that really matter. And I can\u2019t help it, it\u2019s just all so \u2013 life is all so wonderful when you sit and pay attention to it. I think that\u2019s the thing, it\u2019s so wonderful. And I think that \u2013 you know, what I found in the last few months is that a lot of the sort of \u2013 the unconscious fears and the doubts, and the kind \u2013 the self-questioning and all of that really intense stuff, that all comes to the surface in a moment like this, and it\u2019s really hard. But if you can just get to the other side, you realize how lucky we all are to be here at all, you know. And then if there\u2019s one thing I can do, in my own life, to find some kind of meaning and purpose, where nothing else seems to make any sense, that I make music. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done since I was four years old, and so I really don\u2019t have an option there. But I think the privilege is that I now I have the choice as to whether to share it with the world, and I have a kind of creative self-trust that will, that tends to get these ideas off the ground.\n\nYou know, I was thinking, during your last question, I was thinking about just the fact that when I was younger, you know, I would take something to my mom that I\u2019d recorded, and I would say, \u201cHey, I made this, you know, what do you think about it?\u201d And that, you know, any child who has ever done this, which is everyone, you know how fragile the idea is at that moment, you know. And all the parent figure needs to say at that moment is like, \u201cAh, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very good,\u201d or, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t like it,\u201d you know and it\u2019s \u2013 just crushed forever, never to return. And so in a funny sense, if the parent says, \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic and you need to do much more of that thing, and show it to all your friends, and I\u2019m very, very impressed,\u201d and all that stuff, that\u2019s almost equally, you know, almost equally damaging. And there\u2019s just this really, really kind of careful middle ground where like the value of the idea is in the fact that you had it, not in what the idea represents or means or where it takes you or anything. It\u2019s just that you\u2019re having ideas means that you\u2019re doing the right thing, and I was so, so lucky to have that kind of, that in my mom, you know, I was brought up by a single mom, and she was always open eared for my ideas. It was always, you know, open to discussion, to dialogue. \n\nShe\u2019d bring her opinion about things in a really beautiful way, where it was always my thing and I could make up my own mind. And I think that, you know, finishing something and knowing that the value is that it\u2019s finished, not that it\u2019s good. But that you paid attention to it, and that you\u2019re proud of it, is a very addictive and wonderful thing in a sense, and so maybe not addictive, but moreish, you know, once you\u2019ve done it once, you can do it again, but bigger, and you can do it again, but bigger. And songs, songs turn into arrangements, and arrangements turn into collections of songs, and then they turn into albums, and then albums turn into tours and then tours \u2013 because you, you start dreaming in kind of higher and higher resolution, but that\u2019s because you\u2019re able to sit down with someone who believed in you, and I think I\u2019ve had to be that person for myself a bit this year, in a way that I haven\u2019t been used to. \n\nYou know, I\u2019ve been lucky enough to have my family around me. But, you know, I mean, Ben knows literally more than anyone in the world that I\u2019ll sit down and just think, what am I doing? I\u2019m lost. Is this good? Am I good, is this, am I important, you know, am I too important? You know, is this all too consequential to continue? Is it not consequential enough? You know, and all these angry voices that vent at different things at different times on the internet. And you know, it\u2019s really, it\u2019s a very interesting time. And it\u2019s a great big dance, you know, if you\u2019re able to step back and observe it, and it\u2019s tough. But I\u2019m really, really looking forward to kind of entering back into a world where it\u2019s possible to take the lessons that I think we\u2019ve all be learning over this time, creatively and otherwise and kind of put them to use in real life.\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, so one of the things that you just said, I think is really \u2013 well, a lot of what you said is like very important, but like one thing in particular, which is this feedback that you got from your mother, or the feedback that you\u2019re getting from your colleagues. Like that, it\u2019s just so, it\u2019s so critically important, you know, and I think your mother is a violinist and a conductor and a teacher, and so like she \u2013 you know, she has practice giving people feedback. \n\nAnd you know, I have the same thing with my daughter right, who is 12 years old, and trying to write a book. She\u2019s a voracious reader, and she\u2019s like decided at 12 years old that she wants to write a fantasy novel, and you want to absolutely encourage that. But you also want to be able to give some feedback so that there\u2019s something constructive. It\u2019s like, okay, like here are all the great things that you\u2019re doing, and the most wonderful thing about what you\u2019re attempting is that you\u2019re attempting it. You should feel really good about yourself that you\u2019re doing that. And here are some things you should think about to maybe make it technically better. And like, if you get that wrong, you can crush someone, especially someone who\u2019s starting, and they\u2019re afraid and self-conscious. So, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a blessing to have those people around you who know how to give you feedback.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  Yeah, and I think if someone makes space for you, it\u2019s contagious. You know, you start making space for other people in some ways too. I find the kind of act of giving in that way, it just never ends. It just gives and gives, and so if you give somebody room to have an idea on their own terms, then it seems to me like the kind of magic in that process will figure itself out.\n\nI remember being 12 years old, and I wanted to write a fantasy novel, actually. I have it on my computer somewhere, the novel I wrote. Because I too was ravaging through these fantasy series and I loved it, and I wanted to make these magical things come to life. Honestly, I was trying to find my outlet at that time, right? I loved music and I listened to lots of it, but I loved writing and I loved talking. I loved playing video games. There were all different ways I was living out these kinds of, almost you could call them spiritual dreams, like I wanted a spirit of something to exist. I wanted to be putting it into the world and living it. There are all sorts of ways you can do that, and I think it takes a mixture of kind of boundaries and freedom, to end up with something that works. And no one ever gets it completely right, and that\u2019s wonderful. That\u2019s part of what makes us human.\n\n\nBen, I know you\u2019ve spoken a lot about this to me as well, about how just the freedom you were granted in your school environment and home environment \u2013 just to be able to play, meant that you were kind of \u2013 it just meant that you, it might look on paper as though if someone gives you the responsibility of the school production that you would go and mess it up because you didn\u2019t know what you were doing, but actually it doesn\u2019t end up being like that because if you\u2019re given the space to figure it out, then you figure it out. That\u2019s the kind of benefit of trusting something, is that it will give something back to you. That\u2019s something both Ben and I have been lucky with, is we\u2019ve been trusted at times where \u2013 I don\u2019t know, Ben. Maybe we didn\u2019t have everything figured out but we were able to figure it out or really start figuring it out, because we were given the space to.\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  I could talk to you guys all day long, like this is so great. You guys are doing just such great stuff. I can\u2019t wait to see what you\u2019re going to do next, and I\u2019m just confident, given that both of you are this fountain of creativity, that the what next is going to be interesting. I\u2019m sending you all my best thoughts for the Grammys, like I really hope you win Album of the Year. That would be so amazing. \n\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  Thank you so much. It\u2019s such a pleasure to connect and talk and \u2013 and yeah, honestly, I feel like we could literally talk for, you know, hours and hours and hours and maybe some time we should \u2013 we should just get a beer in the real world and do just that.\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  That would be really cool.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  That would be great. I would love to do that. All right. Well, thank \u2013 thank you all so much.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Well, that was the first part of Kevin\u2019s conversation with Ben Bloomberg and Jacob Collier. Kevin, wow, that was like \u2013 that was an amazing conversation.\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, I could have spent all day long talking to these guys. They are so incredible, like, not just in terms of the things that they are producing and the prodigious talent that they have, but like, I love their approach to creativity. They\u2019re so adventurous and fearless with what they\u2019re willing to try. \n\n\nAnd like they have that, you know, we talk about growth mindset all the time at Microsoft. They really do have a growth mindset where they just assume that they\u2019re going to be able to learn what they need to learn to solve the creative challenges that they have set for themselves.\n\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  There were so many notes that I was taking during your conversation because it was so good, you know, and that was one of the things that I really thought was interesting was you mentioned that fearlessness and that fact that, like, as you said, like, they had the permission to, you know, speak about doing that crazy thing, like when you were talking about engineering, without feeling like they would be shut down and having that willingness to just do something and pursue it, you know, and just to make great things without worrying about is this going to work or not. But just saying, OK, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re going to do this.\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. And \u2013 and that is \u2013 it\u2019s a common thing, I think, in many disciplines, not just the arts, but in science and in technology as well, where if you\u2019re trying to do something that really is new, the definition of new is that no one\u2019s ever done it before, and that\u2019s a frightening thing, like, exploring the unknown. \n\nAnd, having the right environment where you get the feedback that you need to ground yourself in reality, but also that gives you the encouragement to go attempt these bold, ambitious, scary things, I think is so important in any field or discipline.\n\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  No, you\u2019re exactly right. And kind of on that note, you know, I was thinking, obviously what Ben and Jacob do does kind of fuse the lines of art and technology. You know, it\u2019s very much art, but the technology helps inform that. \n\nBut I was curious from your perspective, because you mentioned you\u2019re not a musician, listening to them talk about their approach, how much of that rang true to you and what you do with engineering?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Well, I think creativity is very similar across a bunch of different disciplines. You know, so a lot of what they are \u2013 a lot of what they\u2019re trying to do is to make something that other people will like and enjoy, and obviously they\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019re doing that. The success that they have seen, you know, the Grammy nominations, you know, sort of a reflection of the extent to which they have impressed their peers. \n\nAnd then, you know, the commercial success that they\u2019ve seen, especially recently with Djesse Vol. 3, I think is a testament to how good a job they\u2019ve done making something that impresses and resonates with a bigger audience.\n\nBut the first thing that you really are having to do when you\u2019re creating something is like you have to really please yourself, like you are \u2013 you\u2019re doing something that scratches a creative itch or, you know, you have to have, you know, that intrinsic motivation, I think, to go do something like this. \n\nAnd again, like I think it comes back to creating something new. So when it is new and no one\u2019s ever done it before and you don\u2019t have an audience or you\u2019re building a product and like you don\u2019t have users, you have to have that intrinsic motivation, like what motivates you every day to go really just in some cases, bang your head against the wall, because the problems that you\u2019re trying to solve can be really, really daunting and challenging. \n\nAnd, you know, in the early days, you\u2019re not getting much feedback at all. So you have to \u2013 you know, you have to really figure out, like, where your energy is coming from to go make a thing. \n\nAnd so, like that \u2013 that mix of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation, which I think you can really see with them, like Jacob is very, very daring in the creative choices that he makes. You know, I think Ben is very, very daring in the things that he\u2019s building to empower those creative choices. And, you know, that \u2013 that is, I think, coming from within, not because they had some desire to be famous, and I find that very, very interesting.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Absolutely. Well, that\u2019s all for today. We were so delighted to have Ben and Jacob on the show. We liked them so much, that we actually had so much great conversation, that they are going to be back on the next episode. So, be sure to stay tuned to hear the rest of this incredible conversation. You don\u2019t want to miss it.\n\nSend us a message anytime at BehindtheTech@microsoft.com, and thank you for listening.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  See you next time.\n\n\n"}
