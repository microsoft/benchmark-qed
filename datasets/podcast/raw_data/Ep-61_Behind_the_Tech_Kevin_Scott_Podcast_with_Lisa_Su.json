{"episode": "Ep-61 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Lisa Su", "text": "LISA SU: No offense. Software is very interesting, but at the time, hardware was much more sexy to me, and I had the opportunity to see how you could, you know, build chips, and build, you know, they weren\u2019t the most advanced chips in the world, but to me, it was like amazing. It was amazing that you could build, you know, some transistors on something the size of a coin. You could look at it in the microscope. You could measure it on a test system, and you know, that\u2019s how I got into hardware, and that\u2019s how I got into semiconductors, actually.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we\u2019re going to get behind the tech. We\u2019ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what\u2019s happening today. Stick around.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello, and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m cohost, Christina Warren, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And today, we are bringing you a conversation with someone who is such an important part of the actual materials that make up our technology and just an incredibly cool person.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So Lisa is just sort of inspirational, I think, in general, you know, given her career arc, and like the position that she\u2019s in now of, you know, leadership in the technology industry, but I always like talking to semiconductor people. Like, my bias as a computer scientist is low-level system stuff, so I am just a super-big fan of Lisa and her company, and everything that they\u2019re doing. Yeah, like I even have an AMD, like custom-built machine, sitting under my desk, right now, that I\u2019ve been very proud of owning for the past three years.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, it\u2019s funny,  during the pandemic, when everyone was \u2013 I was amongst them, and I built an AMD system, and it was my first AMD system that I\u2019d built in a really long time, but I also helped build a threadripper system for a friend, who claims that they needed more compute than I think they actually did, but it was really fun for me, anyway, and so I\u2019m right there with you. I don\u2019t have the same, you know, passion for low-level languages and system calls like you do, but I\u2019m a huge fan of Lisa Su and AMD, and I\u2019m really looking forward to this interview.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Dr. Lisa Su is Chair and Chief Executive Officer at AMD, where she\u2019s led the company\u2019s transformation into a high-performance and adaptive computing leader. She\u2019s passionate about working closely with partners to deliver the next generation of computing and AI solutions that can solve the world\u2019s most important challenges. \n\nIn 2018, she was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2021. She was recognized by the IEEE with its highest semiconductor honor, the Robert N. Noyce medal, and was appointed by President Biden to the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. \n\nShe also serves on the Board of Directors for the semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nLisa, welcome to Behind the Tech. Thank you so much for joining me today.\n\n\nLISA SU: Oh, it\u2019s great to be here with you, Kevin. Thanks for having me. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So we always start with folks from the beginning. So I\u2019m just curious how you got interested in the first place in science and technology, like did it start when you were a kid, with your parents, with \u2013 like, what were \u2013 how did it begin.\n\nLISA SU: Yeah, absolutely, so you know, Kevin I was born in Taiwan. I actually grew up in New York, and my dad was a mathematician. He was actually statistician, and so, you know, we would sit at the dining room table, and he would, you know, make me do multiplication tables with him so that I had to be decent at math, but I I\u2019ve always really enjoyed, you know, sort of just seeing how things worked and building things, so one of my earliest engineering memories was my brother and I were playing with his remote-controlled car, and it was kind of going down the hallway, and then it just suddenly stopped, and I was like, \"Why did it stop?\" And so, you know, I opened it up and saw there was a loose wire, and if I put the wire back in, it started working again, and that was just super-interesting, that that\u2019s how things worked, so I think that\u2019s \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: How old were you?\n\nLISA SU: I don\u2019t know, I was probably 10, or something like that, and my brother was younger, my younger brother, and yeah, I just kind of got curious about how things work.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think those are \u2013 it\u2019s really interesting, those serendipitous moments when you are young, where you go from, like looking at something as like this inscrutable, almost magical thing that you don\u2019t understand, to being able to, like have some kind of agency over it, like you peer into how the things work, and like you understand something. Like, I think they are just super-interesting moments.\n\nLISA SU: Yes, no, absolutely, because you\u2019re just so proud of thinking, \u2018Wow, like I learned something there,\u2019 and that kind of carries with you.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and so you were a EE, like how \u2013 you know, as you\u2019re going through high school, did you know you wanted to be an electrical engineer before you went to college, or did you decide once you got into school?\n\nLISA SU: You know, I don\u2019t think I could say I knew, Kevin. In high school, I was \u2013 I have to admit, I was kind of a nerd, so I did things like, you know, the math team, and you know, projects like that, but I happened to get into MIT, and that was my first choice, and so I went to undergrad at MIT, and at MIT, like the \u2013 everyone\u2019s an engineer, and you know, much of the starting class is either electrical engineering or computer science, and so I think that helped me kind of go in that direction.\n\nYou know, sort of the big, big decision was are you going to be a hardware person or a software person? In other words, are you going to be an electrical engineer or a computer scientist, and that perhaps was what at least all of the kids around me were thinking about, but there was no question I was going to be an engineer, so that was good.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And how did you gravitate towards being a hardware person, because \u2013 like, I sort of had the same thing where I did \u2013 you know, when I was young, like a little bit of electronics and electrical engineering stuff, and a little bit of software stuff, and I \u2013 like, clearly gravitated towards software. I used to tell myself that it\u2019s because, like software is inherently better, and like, it\u2019s faster, and yeah, I mean, like that\u2019s the lie you tell yourself when you\u2019re a \u2013 you know, a teenager, like in your twenties, but like other people, like have similar beliefs in the \u2013 in the other direction. Like, I\u2019m just sort of curious, like how did you know that, like you wanted to be a hardware person?\n\nLISA SU: Well, you know, I had two experiences. I had, you know, experience in software where I was like helping sort of a lab program. One of the things that\u2019s nice about MIT is that they really encourage sort of undergraduate research, so \u2013 you know, in addition to the coursework, they encourage you to get sort of side jobs, and I don\u2019t know, I must have got paid five dollars an hour, or something like that, but it allowed you to work in labs with people.\n\nAnd so I had two experiences working in labs. I had one that was more of a software thing, which \u2013 you know, I was helping program whatever, some professor\u2019s experiments. And I had one that was a hardware thing, which was in semiconductors, and I got to do basic grudge work for the semiconductor graduate students, but I was building something, so \u2013 you know, I was putting wafers into a big reactive ion etcher. I was running the experiment. I could look at it in the microscope, and that\u2019s how I fell in love with hardware.\n\nI mean no offense. Software is very interesting, but at the time, hardware was much more sexy to me, and I had the opportunity to see how you could, you know, build chips, and build, very, very \u2013 they weren\u2019t the most advanced chips in the world, but to me, it was like amazing. It was amazing that you could build, you know, some transistors on something the size of a coin. You could look at it in the microscope. You could measure it on a test system, and you know, that\u2019s how I got into hardware, and that\u2019s how I got into semiconductors, actually.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, like I think that something all of us realize at some point is, if you are in computing, it\u2019s actually both pieces that are very important, and like, we\u2019ll get back to this in a minute when we start talking about the work that we\u2019ve been doing together, like Microsoft and AMD, for so many years. But like, I want to first, like poke on this practical experience that you have because, like one of the themes that we have, talking to computer scientists and engineers is this notion that the abstraction layers that we have built up over the decades sometimes obscure some of the low-level things.\n\nLike I wonder \u2013 like I\u2019m not a EE, and so I don\u2019t know whether you can get that experience that you, anymore, in a Material Science program or a EE program at university, where you get that visceral feel for what it\u2019s like to actually make a semiconductor.\n\nLISA SU: Yeah, I think it\u2019s so important, Kevin. I mean, I\u2019m a big believer. I mean, there are people who are, let\u2019s call it, you know, very book smart, and then there\u2019s, you know, sort of like people who are just pragmatic and have had a chance to experience different things, and I\u2019m definitely the latter. You know, I think I learn through experiences, and I think those experiences are so important, right? I remember, you know, sort of the first classes I took as an undergrad, and it was things like, you know, building your own little computer, and yes, you have to build the circuit, but you also have to program it, or as I said, you know, building your first, you know, semiconductor device, and just seeing how you go through each of those steps. \n\nI won\u2019t say that everybody loves those experiences, but I certainly do, and you know, not that school is supposed to be job training. It\u2019s not supposed to be job training, but it\u2019s supposed to help us to think through what do we like to do in life, and it\u2019s kind of stuck with me, with the notion of, it\u2019s so important to see the results of what you\u2019re doing, and you know, I love the fact that I can build products that I can touch and feel, and you know, walk into Best Buy and see those products, or walk into your data center and see those products, so that\u2019s what I enjoy.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, and there is \u2013 there is just this fine thing, I think, about hardware in general, because even when you\u2019re writing a program, you don\u2019t get the same sense as you\u2019re building it. Even if you\u2019re sort of assembling it piece by piece, you don\u2019t get the same sense that you get when you\u2019re, like building your own PC, like where you buy a motherboard and a case and a power supply and a CPU, and you like just sort of are assembling this thing physically, and you, at the end get to have, like have this working physical artifact.\n\nLISA SU: Yeah, so, Kevin, am I encouraging you to come over to the hardware side, or \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: No, look, I\u2019ve been doing both for a very long time, but \u2013 like, I\u2019m thinking right now, actually, so the machine that I\u2019m on right now, taping this, has a \u2013 like a \u2013 AMD, like 32-core threadripper CPU, and I\u2019m getting \u2013 which I, you know, very custom configured. I\u2019m getting ready to do another build, and like, I\u2019m probably going to, you know, hand assemble this next one, because I haven\u2019t built my own PC in a long time.\n\nLISA SU: Oh, Kevin, that\u2019s very exciting. I must send you our latest threadripper because we just kind of got the next generation out there. It\u2019s pretty cool, but \u2013 look, I completely agree with you. I mean, the opportunity to kind of build tech and touch tech is super cool, and it\u2019s great for getting students into STEM that I know is something that\u2019s very important to you, and to me as well.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, so you \u2013 you\u2019re majoring in electrical engineering at MIT, and then what\u2019s next? You go to grad school? You go straight into the workforce? Like, like how are you making that decision, because like that\u2019s a really interesting time in your career.\n\nLISA SU: Yeah, I was a \u2013 what they call a lifer at MIT, so I did my undergraduate, master\u2019s, and PhD at MIT. It wasn\u2019t a super-easy decision, I think you\u2019re right, Kevin, because \u2013 you know, at the time, all my friends were graduating, they were getting jobs, you know, they were moving to cool places, but I felt like I wasn\u2019t done learning and there was still more to learn, and I really appreciate sort of my PhD advisor, you know? His name was Dimitri Antoniadis. He was \u2013 you know, one of the people who built sort of the very early simulation, you know, capabilities for semiconductors.\n\nAnd like, I felt like there was more to learn, and so \u2013 you know, I decided to get a PhD, and my focus was semiconductor devices, so I was building, you know, a quarter of micron devices, which at the time was very, very advanced. Today we are talking about 2 nanometer, but hey, back then, it was state-of-the-art type things, and we were thinking about, you know, how do we push the envelope on  scaling, because you know, even then, people were talking about whether Moore\u2019s Law was ending.\n\nIt obviously didn\u2019t end, so \u2013 yeah, so I worked on something called silicon-on-insulator devices, and it was a lot of learning, but it was also, like fun to be able to think that you\u2019re doing something that is, you know, sort of state-of-the-art research as part of your studies.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, so I\u2019d love to get your perspective on what you think the value of your PhD was, because I think a lot of people think that most of the value is that contribution that they\u2019re making to the state of the art, but like, I kind of think that the value is in the sort of discipline of getting a very complicated thing done and synthesizing, like incredibly complicated information, and \u2013 you know, just learning how to be a researcher, or like someone doing something incredibly sophisticated around a whole bunch of other people who have this same, like high ambition level for the things that they\u2019re doing, so I\u2019d love to get your perspective on, like, the value of that degree was for you.\n\nLISA SU: Yeah, absolutely, so \u2013 now, you have to understand my perspective. Like, I was so impatient, Kevin, as a student, so as soon as I started the PhD program, it was like, \"I need to finish as soon as possible,\" so I was a little bit impatient, but I think the value of a PhD, for me, and as I, you know, advise other people is, it is not job training. It is not \u2013 whatever project you do, you know, some are great projects, some are more esoteric projects, but it\u2019s an opportunity to really \u2013 for me, it was how to learn to think about solving very difficult problems. \n\nAnd if you think about \u2013 it\u2019s a problem that, you know, nobody else has solved out there, so you can\u2019t go to a book and say, \"Hey, this is how to solve it.\" You actually have to think through, \"How do I solve this? How do I contribute something to the industry or to academia, where the answer isn\u2019t clear?\u201d And the process of doing that, over, for me, it was four years, you know, three, four, five years, really gives you the confidence that, you know, you can contribute at the highest level in a certain field.\n\nAnd you know, that\u2019s what I take away from it. I just think it teaches you how to think, and you know, what we do, what you do, what I do, you know, all day long is, you know, how do we solve very, you know, interesting tough problems, and you know, that time gave me the confidence that, you know, you could do that, and even at the time, it was also very much about a team. I loved working with the other grad students when we worked together on how to solve some of these problems.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and I think the thing that you said about \u2013 like, they\u2019re very tough problems, and they\u2019re also ones that no one else has solved before, so \u2013 like, you can\u2019t go consult someone to say, like, \"Hey, how did you do exactly this,\" or skip ahead to the answer. Like, there\u2019s no skipping ahead, like you\u2019ve just got to sort it out.\n\nLISA SU: Yes.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So after MIT, what was your first job?\n\nLISA SU: You know, my first job actually was at Texas Instruments in Dallas, and I wasn\u2019t there super-long. I was there about a little less than a year. I was kind of homesick. You know, I lived \u2013 by the way, I live in Texas now, but at the time, it was so far from home for me, so I ended up spending the majority of the early part of my career at IBM in New York, and I joined the \u2013 you know, what was TJ Watson Research Center, and then the IBM Microelectronics team.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And so were you working on the RISC processors that they were building there?\n\nLISA SU: I was. I was always \u2013 you know, I spent my time in their sort of process technology area as we were continuing to look at the next generation technologies, but yeah, the first processor \u2013 I\u2019ve been working on processors, like forever. I mean, like, you know, it\u2019s been \u2013 I don\u2019t know, now 30 years. \n\nThe first processor that I worked on at IBM was actually a Power PC processor that went into PCs. It actually went into some of the PCs, as well as into some of the larger server systems at IBM.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I remember, like I went to a science and technology Governor\u2019s School, and \u2013 like, which had us do a bunch of internships, and I interned at a place that had a Power PC, like one of the very first ones, that I just remember, like what an amazing thing that was.\n\nLISA SU: It really \u2013 it was super, super fun. I mean, it was \u2013 again, the idea of, you know, sort of RISC processing, you know, for us, it was how do we get the performance and power, and all that, in the right place, so \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, this is sort of an interesting thing. I \u2013 like, I don\u2019t know whether you want to talk about this or not, but \u2013 you know, we had this big revolution, like I\u2019m guessing early in both of our careers, where like there was all of this innovation on instruction set architectures and \u2013 you know, there was like Power PC, and PA-RISC and MIPS, and the deck part, the \u2013like, 21, 164, 264 series.\n\nLISA SU: Yeah, the Alpha stuff.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Alpha, yeah, and you know, what ended up happening, just in terms of like where the bulk of the compute in the world went was to processors running this X86 instruction set, which you build them, \n\nLISA SU: We do build them.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: you know, Intel builds them, and now, like we\u2019ve got this sort of interesting world where you\u2019ve got ARM in a bunch of places, you know, that are RISC construction set machines, and then you\u2019ve got these GPUs, which are like an increasingly large volume of compute, and so it\u2019s sort of interesting. Like a lot of the things happening now feel to me like the things that were happening 30 years ago, 20 years ago, and like I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve reflected any on that.\n\nLISA SU: Yeah, you know, it\u2019s interesting, I hadn\u2019t actually bridged the parallel between the two. I think what has been the case, and I\u2019m actually curious to get your thoughts on this, is the instruction set, certainly back in those days, when there were so many different ones, and sort of the consolidation, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been so much about the instruction set. \n\nI mean, people ask me all the time about ARM versus X86, and I\u2019m like, \"Look\u2026 It\u2019s not about ARM versus X86. They\u2019re both, you know, great instruction sets. It\u2019s really about sort of the \u2013 the applications and the ecosystem we\u2019re trying to run on top of it,\u201d and you know, some \u2013 you know, there\u2019s a lot of reasons that you want to be at scale, so \u2013 you know, if I think about what happened, you know, 20 years ago. It\u2019s just that you had too many instruction sets, and many of them were not at scale, and so it just wasn\u2019t \u2013 you know, it didn\u2019t scale, and now you look today and with what we\u2019re doing going forward, the workloads are changing, right? \n\nI mean, that\u2019s what made the GPU so important now as we think through AI. As the workloads change, you need, you know, somewhat different compute, and you know, that\u2019s where the choices get made.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, yeah, look, I think I\u2019m like one of the weird people who cares about instruction sets because I started my career writing, like a lot of assembly language code, and in grad school I was a compiler and computer architecture person and \u2013 you know, so having written a software decoder for X86, you know, so I think you care if you\u2019re implementing something at the lowest level of the stack, but like that\u2019s such a tiny, little minority of the development activity. And like, everybody else, like what you want is, like lower power, like high performance and cheap.\n\nLISA SU: Yes!\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And you know, it\u2019s like those three things, and to your point, like I think scale drives that.\n\nLISA SU: And would you agree, Kevin, that \u2013 as you think about where things are right now, the relative benefit of programming at the lowest, lowest level is perhaps less, just because there is so much computing power and that\u2019s why people are moving up the stack, for speed and agility, and all that stuff, or what do you think about the relative tradeoffs of the  lowest-level programming versus\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I think it\u2019s going to be the same thing. I think there\u2019s going to be this very small minority of folks, and I think it\u2019s just going to get to be a smaller and smaller minority over time who need to deal with the lowest level details of the compute stack, because \u2013 you know, they are trying to do something that\u2019s right on the edge of possible, or like, they have to wring every last bit of performance out of the lowest level things. And I think eventually most of that gets abstracted away for most developers.\n\nLike, that\u2019s what you want, it\u2019s what\u2019s always happened.\n\nLISA SU: I completely agree. I mean, that\u2019s certainly everything that we see is \u2013 and the technology is changing so fast that, you know, the basic foundation of the compute is getting so fast that \u2013 you know, you can sort of make up for whatever \u2013 let\u2019s call it loss of abstraction, you know, pretty easily.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, the thing \u2013 you know, I do have this concern though, like I mentioned this a few minutes ago. Even though that\u2019s true, you still need this population of engineers who are excited about those low-level details. Like you need to hire them, like \u2013 you know, we need to hire them for, like folks building low-level system software, and so \u2013 you know, I do worry when \u2013 you know, when I look at what some kids are learning in computer science curricula now. Like your abstraction level that you\u2019re operating at is so high, like whether or not you, like, really deeply understand, like the full stack that you\u2019re operating on top of, and then have the opportunity to even get interested in being one of those systems people who is poking around at the low levels, because that doesn\u2019t go away at all.\n\nLISA SU: Yeah, actually, Kevin, I think you\u2019re totally right. I think as we think about, you know, how do you have the best sort of engineers, or you know, sort of the brightest people, you want them to have that breadth of experience. I mean, it\u2019s really important. I mean, you can still specialize, but the breadth of knowing, really, how computers work, and what do you need to do to enable that is, I think, super-important.\n\nYou know, one of the things that happens for a lot of the folks that I talk to is, how do we get enough people interested in hardware? Because you know, software is the sexy place, so \u2013 and I try to say, \"Look \u2026\" Everyone is different in their interests, but there is so much that can still be done around optimization of hardware and driving that, so \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: More now than in the past 20 years. Like, I think this is the most exciting time in hardware that we\u2019ve seen in a few decades.\n\nLISA SU: I completely agree, completely agree.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So I go into work every day, and I\u2019m just completely surprised at the things that I\u2019m working on. So you know, when I was in college and grad school, I did \u2013 you know, an internship at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, and wrote a whole bunch of stuff for the Thinking Machines, CM5 supercomputer. I \u2013 you know, I had an internship at Silicon Graphics, right after they bought Cray Research, and like working on the Origin 2000, like this big cash-coherent pneumo-machine that they built that was super innovative.\n\nAnd then I left grad school, and like, precisely none of that mattered for 20 years! And now all of it, like, matters again, like you really do have to think about some of these, like old high-performance computing principles to write some of the software that we\u2019re building today, and computer architecture matters again. Like, it\u2019s awesome.\n\nLISA SU: Yes, it is. It is. And I mean, certainly for some of the stuff that \u2013 you know, that you\u2019re doing, and Microsoft\u2019s doing, it\u2019s \u2013 you are absolutely pushing the envelope on everything that we think about as it relates to hardware and systems.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So let\u2019s go back to your career progression. So you were at IBM, and then at some point \u2013 like, was the next step joining AMD? Like, you\u2019ve been there for a while now.\n\nLISA SU: Yeah, yso I was at IBM for 12 \u2013 13 years, you know, did a lot of stuff around our semiconductor R&D, and sort of the next generation processor technologies. And then, you know, I\u2019m a semiconductor person, right? That\u2019s,who I am, through and through, and from an opportunity standpoint, sort of getting to be an influence at a sort of larger scale. So I actually went to Freescale Semiconductor first.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, interesting.\n\nLISA SU: Yeah. Yeah, I was at Freescale for five years. I was actually, I had your title. I was CTO at Freescale, as the company was thinking about how to reshape their portfolio and then I ran their networking and multimedia business for a couple of years, and you know, by that time I\u2019d already moved to Austin, so now I\u2019m officially, you know, a Texas person, and then I had the opportunity to come join AMD, and so I joined AMD about 12 years ago, something like that, and it\u2019s been a great ride.\n\nYou know, we\u2019ve gone through, you know, a set of things as we reshaped the company, but like I said, I haven\u2019t been far from processors anywhere near my career. Somehow, processors find me, or I find them, so \u2013\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, when in your career did you decide that you wanted to lead teams of people, that leadership was a thing that you either enjoyed or believed was necessary to get done what needed to be done.\n\nLISA SU: Yeah, it was probably in my early years at IBM. You know, one of the things that I had to kind of decide is \u2013 and that someone asked me \u2013 I think my manager asked me, \"Hey, do you want to be an IBM fellow, or do you want to be an IBM vice president?\" And at the time, I was like, \"Huh, that\u2019s an interesting question.\"\n\nI actually thought that what was most interesting to me, yes, I liked working on my own research, and you know, I had some good ideas, but what was much more fun was seeing teams get together and do things that, you know, frankly, we didn\u2019t think were possible, and \u2013 you know, like the early memories of, hey, you\u2019re on a project, you have to ship something to a customer at some given time, and like nothing works. That\u2019s what I enjoyed the most. Like, I enjoyed thinking about: how do I pull this together? How do I pull teams together?\n\nSo the answer to that question was, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m smart enough to be an IBM fellow, so I guess I\u2019m going to try to be an IBM vice president, and I had the opportunity to lead small teams that became medium teams, that became larger teams, but that\u2019s actually really what I enjoy the most, Kevin, the technology is super fun, but it is even more, you know, sort of rewarding to see teams come together and do something that, you know, truly is groundbreaking, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always enjoyed in my career.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And you know, like I want to dig into, like what the career progression was, or \u2013 like has been, at AMD, but \u2013 you know, I think the whole arc of your career is extraordinary.\n\nLISA SU: Well, thank you.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: You\u2019re the daughter of immigrants to the United States, and you go from, you know, like, first generation \u2013 you know, American, to Chair and CEO of one of the most important semiconductor companies in the world. And like, your path through that was just being technically excellent, like getting a STEM degree, and \u2013 you know, leveraging technical excellence to, like get into this, like fantastic leadership position, and like that\u2019s an inspiration for a lot of people, and like, you know, probably particularly for both immigrants and young women who are thinking about their path, and so I wonder, how do you think about \u2013 you\u2019re probably going to blush \u2013\n\nLISA SU: You\u2019re making me feel like uncomfortable, Kevin!\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, but \u2013 whether you like it or not, you are a role model, and so I wonder, you know, how do you think about, like that job. So in addition to being CEO, like you are a role model for folks who aspire to be like you.\n\nLISA SU: Yeah, well, look, thank you for that, Kevin. I think a few things. I mean, first of all, I was \u2013 as good as one is, one also needs to be sort of in the right place at the right time, and I think I\u2019ve been somewhat fortunate in the sense that I\u2019ve found the right place at the right time. I mean, AMD, when I joined, you know, many people asked me, \"Well, why would you join AMD,\" at that point in time? And actually, I never thought about why wouldn\u2019t I join AMD.\n\nI mean, look, in the United States, you know, how many companies are building high-performance processors, right? There\u2019s just not that many that are doing that, and I thought this was a place that I could help. I was passionate about what we were doing.\n\nLike, for me, I never said, \u201cI have to be a CEO.\u201d That wasn\u2019t my thing. What I said, in my mind, it was really important for me to work on something that I thought was important. Like, I wanted to be \u2013 you know, I love semiconductors. I want to be in the industry, in a place where I can make an impact on the industry, and AMD has been a great platform for that, because I do think that, you know, high-performance computing and, you know, this technology is so foundational for what we have to do, but you know, to your point about, you know, being a role model or helping, like a lot of people helped me get to where I am.\n\nYou know, I think the mentors that helped me the most were the ones that told me when I screwed up, frankly. Everyone can tell you how great you are, but it\u2019s much, much better when someone tells you you\u2019ve made a mistake, and so I\u2019ve  appreciated that, and I think my job, or I hope what I can do is also help others feel like, hey, it\u2019s absolutely possible for you to follow your aspirations and dreams. You\u2019ll make some mistakes along the way, but that\u2019s okay.\n\nAnd so I get an opportunity to meet a lot of women who are earlier in their career, and much of what I encourage them to do is actually be ambitious and feel like you can actually tell somebody what you want to do, because there are plenty of people who want to help, but you know, sometimes people feel, you know, shy, or \u2013 you know, \"I can\u2019t say that,\" and I\u2019m like, \"Yes, you can.\" You know, \"Yes, you can.\" You can absolutely do incredible things and people will be glad to help you along the way.\n\nOf course you have to be good, of course you have to work hard. All those things are true, but I think it\u2019s just good to encourage people that, yeah, you can do some \u2013 some amazing things. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I could not agree more with that advice, like telling people that you have permission to be ambitious, and you should advocate for your ambitions, is so, so important. It\u2019s crazy to me how many people don\u2019t do that, or like don\u2019t have a clear sense in their head of what their ambition actually is. \n\nSo you have, just in your time at AMD, like seen a pretty incredible, like set of developments in the semiconductor industry, so like, you know, we continue to make just amazing improvements in process technology, you know, like I know, since I\u2019ve been, like a professional computer scientist, which is, a very long time now. People have been talking about the end of Moore\u2019s Law, and yet we \u2013 you know, we continue to \u2013 I mean, like Dennard Scaling is done, right, but we have been able to figure out how to, like economically get more and more compute, over time, and we have, you know, figured out how to put that compute to use for crazy things, like the whole mobile ecosystem, like what you can do today with PCs, like what you can do with high-performance computing for scientific workloads, and like now all this AI stuff.\n\nSo you know, I wonder, you know, over your 12 years, like what you think are the most interesting trends.\n\nLISA SU: Yeah, you\u2019re absolutely right. You know, Moore\u2019s Law, I mean, we\u2019ve been talking about Moore\u2019s Law either slowing down or ending for the longest time. It really hasn\u2019t. It has slowed down, but it has \u2013 also, you know, allowed us to kind of think differently about how we put chips together.\n\nBy the way, Bob Dennard was like, you know, one of my heroes, as a young engineer, and I think what we\u2019ve learned through this process is \u2013 you know, I often say, to my teams and others, that it\u2019s so important to make the right bets on technology because it does take so long for it to, you know, really play out.\n\nYou know, so the fact that Moore\u2019s Law has slowed down has meant that there are different ways to put together chips. Like one of the \u2013 probably the most important decisions that we\u2019ve made at AMD, and this was back in the 2014 \u2013 2015 timeframe, was we decided that if Moore\u2019s Law is slowing down, then the better way to put together chips is to really break them up in these things called chiplets, and that was like a really important decision. \n\nLike, I remember when we made that decision, and I was like, it was almost a bet the company decision, frankly, because you know, we were trying to get a very, very competitive roadmap out there, but the thought process is: this is the future. \n\nThis is the future of how do you put chips together. We have to figure out how to make them smaller because they yield better, they\u2019re much more cost efficient, but the interconnect between them is so important, and so how do you make that happen, and how do you ensure that, from a programming standpoint, you know, it doesn\u2019t affect software too much.\n\nAnd now, we\u2019ve seen that idea now, on steroids, right? We just, you know, launched our newest AI chip, and by the way, Kevin, thank you so much for being with us at that. You know, it\u2019s like chiplets on steroids, right? It\u2019s like you know, 12 chips stacked on top \u2013 you know, sideways, up and down, and all that stuff. \n\nIf you had asked me, 20 years ago, as a semiconductor student, or as a semiconductor engineer, I\u2019m like, this stuff is never going to work, I mean, never going to work. Like, it\u2019s too complicated. It requires too much precision for it to work, at a level of like 150 billion transistors, but that\u2019s the beauty of our industry.\n\nIt\u2019s like, you know what? We found a way to make it work. Now, I think, as we look forward, that\u2019s what we have to be looking for, is that there are inflection points in technology which enable you to take the next big step, and making those decisions at the right time are the things that I think about, because you know, you do have these fundamental limitations that are there, in terms of physics, but boy, we have incredibly smart people. You give them a problem, and they figure out, oh, there\u2019s a way to get around that problem. It\u2019s just you have to kind of invest in it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, well, and so for folks who aren\u2019t chip people, like let me see if I can try to explain what you just described, and you can correct me where I get it wrong. So for \u2013 when you open up a PC, like \u2013 and you see the thing that is the CPU, like that is not the chip. That\u2019s the package that, for the longest kind of time, a single monolithic die set in, so like you would print a bunch of semiconductors on to a single piece of silicon. You would put it inside of that package and like you would very carefully connect the perimeter of that piece of silicon out to the pins or the balls or whatever the connectors were on that package.\n\nAnd like what you are describing now is like a bunch of innovation is in the packaging technology, and like these components, so chiplets are like little pieces of semiconductors that you place inside of that big package, like there are very complicated ways to interconnect them, and then a separate set of ways to, you know, connect all of that out to the outside of the big package, so they can sit in a motherboard and do its job.\n\nSo, how close did I get?\n\nLISA SU: That was perfect, Kevin. Perfect. I think that, to the casual observer, I think they don\u2019t have to care about any of those things. All they have to care about is, you\u2019re going to get more performance at, you know, a better cost point, so we talk all the time about, in computing, you know, we want to ensure that, you know, Moore\u2019s Law is \u2013 that you would, you know, really double the performance every couple of years. Just going sort of the normal way, you can\u2019t do that, but using all of these techniques and technologies, you really can extend that performance curve, which just gives people like you, Kevin, much more compute for all the great things that you\u2019re doing and building, so that\u2019s our goal in life is to make sure that the compute does scale, that you do get more, and that enables applications to do lots and lots more.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, God knows we need it. It actually, I was a little bit depressed for a while, with computing, because it seemed like we had lost our imagination for what you could do with dramatically more compute, and like we had sort of gone inward, and like, well, okay, like how can I power optimize compute to get, you know, a certain set of capabilities available on a small battery, you know, and things like \u2013 which is, very, very important, but like the thing that\u2019s always really exciting \u2013\n\nLISA SU: It\u2019s not the big iron, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it\u2019s like, what can you do, like if you just, like cost efficiently, had so much more compute? And I think this current generation of generative AI is like one of the answers to that question, and it\u2019s just remarkable, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re anywhere near the end of the scaling laws for things, so it feels exciting to me, more in the way that the internet did, than mobile, just because, you know, we are so quickly deploying so much compute and have so many people with these very inventive ideas about what they can go do with, like this vastly expanded compute landscape that\u2019s available.\n\nLISA SU: I completely agree. I mean, for the last, you know, sort of 10 years, I mean, we\u2019ve had a lot of computing evolution. It\u2019s been more about form factor, frankly, and you know, we\u2019ve done lots of great things, but I think going forward, this is, to me, like the most exciting time in my career, like absolutely hands down. I would have said a very similar thing. I think, you know, AI is the most, you know, sort of important technology of \u2013 you know, the last, forty or fifty years. And it\u2019s because you can see, there\u2019s so much untapped potential. And as much progress we\u2019ve made in what computing can be used for, it\u2019s still like hard to use.\n\nLike, it\u2019s still not quite as accessible as it should be, and generative AI just brings a whole new dimension for how we can use computing, so I completely agree with you, it\u2019s just amazing, what\u2019s in front of us right now. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, the thing that always excites me is when you let people have less constrained imagination. Like, when I was a little kid, and I was reading science fiction books and watching, you know, the first Star Trek series, and you know, all these optimistic science fiction movies and books that were around then, like the computers were incredibly powerful, like they - and this is before, you know, personal computers even existed, like these folks were imagining what a computer could be, and like, maybe some of the reality of, you know, what the computing revolution actually became, in a way, constrained people\u2019s imagination, and like, I think \u2013 you know, what\u2019s happened in the past, you know, handful of years has unconstrained people\u2019s imagination again, and sometimes in like weird ways, but I think in mostly in incredibly optimistic ways, and like that\u2019s exciting, because like I don\u2019t know about you, like I\u2019m of the firm belief that my imagination is not enough, like \u2013\n\nLISA SU: Oh, completely.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: we need everybody imagining.\n\nLISA SU: I completely agree, completely agree.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, so let\u2019s talk a little about, like where you think AI compute is going. So you just announced this really, like what I would call a breakthrough in AMD\u2019s AI compute roadmap with the MI300, which is a very powerful GPU tuned for AI workloads, like we\u2019ve done a lot of work together to try to figure out how to get the most powerful AI workloads working on this system, but like, that\u2019s just one point in time, so obviously, you all, you know, see the same future trajectory that we see, and like you must be thinking all sorts of, like awesome things about what that future looks like for the semiconductor world.\n\nLISA SU: You know, from my perspective, you know, AI is such an empowering technology, and it\u2019s empowering in many dimensions. You know, we talk a lot about the data center from the standpoint of, you know, these large language models, the great work that, you know, Microsoft and OpenAI, and others are doing, and you know, in just training the largest, you know, models in the world. Like, you need lots of compute for that, and that\u2019s where we come in, but I also look at it as \u2013 you know, it\u2019s quite a continuum as to where AI is going to impact our lives, and so \u2013 you know, we look at it as, in the data center, you need the \u2013 it\u2019s called the big iron so that you can train and infer the most complex models.\n\nYou have the opportunities at the edge, when you think about all the data that\u2019s at the edge, and then you have the opportunities at the client and kind of reshaping what PCs do, what mobile phones do, and all of that requires AI capability, although it may not necessarily be exactly the same technology, I think they all want to interoperate together. \n\nSo it has been a super busy year, several years, from the standpoint of, you know, really extending our roadmap from, let\u2019s call it more general purpose processing, to more of the AI capability. And as we go forward, I think we\u2019re going to see AI in all of our computing products, like whether \u2013 you know, data center, edge, client, and it\u2019s a fun place to be, but you know, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re super-happy with the work that we\u2019re doing, you know, certainly in Azure, but also on the \u2013 on the PC and Windows side, like you know, very excited about, you know, what\u2019s going on with the Windows evolution, and you know, the Copilot capabilities there as well.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think one of the interesting things, and again, it just sort of get abstracted away from folks because, you know, you don\u2019t need to think about all of this to make an API call to \u2013 you know, Azure OpenAI API service, but \u2013 and you all have understood this for quite a while, because you have some of the most powerful supercomputers on the top 500 list for scientific workloads:\n\nWhen you\u2019re building these big systems, you have to think about everything, so how you get power into the data center, like how you cool things, how you design racks, how you build your networks, and I think that\u2019s the other really exciting piece here. It\u2019s not just about the chips, but it\u2019s about everything you have to put around the chips, and you really have to have partnerships, you know, like the one that we have to think about the full system design, because otherwise, you have one highly performing thing and if everything around it is not equally high performing, then \u2013 you know, it just doesn\u2019t work.\n\nLISA SU: Yeah, I think that\u2019s what, you know, we all view as the opportunity, right? The opportunity is, you know, through \u2013 you know, deep partnerships like what we have, to really, you know, sort of move computing to the next level of, yes, chips, systems, and then \u2013 you know, also just what you\u2019re doing in terms of the model development itself, and you know, bringing those things synergistically together we can build, you know, better overall systems, you know, going forward.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Cool. Well, we are just about out of time here, and so the last thing that I ask everyone on the podcast, even though your job is like one of the most demanding in the world right now, and it\u2019s gotten nothing but more demanding over the past year, for sure, but I do want to ask you what you do outside of work, for fun.\n\nLISA SU: Well, I have to say, you\u2019re right. I think work is fun. I think you think work is fun too.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Work is! That\u2019s valid, that\u2019s valid.\n\nLISA SU: Work is tremendously fun, but outside of work, I like to play golf, so I have to say, my golf handicap though has definitely gone up in the last few years. I haven\u2019t played enough. And I\u2019m kind of a like a foodie, Kevin, I \u2013 you know, we love to have, you know, great food, and a little bit of Bordeaux wine once in a while. It\u2019s just an opportunity to kind of relax and enjoy all the wonderful things in life.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for taking time out of your very busy schedule to do this with us today. It\u2019s been great to hear more about your story. You know, again, I\u2019m so grateful, not just for the partnership, but for everything you\u2019ve done in your career, and the inspiration you are, for like hopefully a generation of young engineers. Like, we need Lisa Sus in the world, for sure.\n\nLISA SU: Well, thank you so much, Kevin. We need many more Kevin Scotts in the world too. It\u2019s really an honor and pleasure to be here with you today, and I look forward to all that we\u2019ll do together.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Awesome. Thank you.\n\n[Music]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: What a fantastic conversation with Lisa Su. There were so many things that stuck out to me. Her background, you know, it\u2019s impressive, just to kind of see her career arc, and all the different places that she\u2019s been, and I loved listening to the two of you kind of reminisce about how the hardware industry, and that you know, the silicon industry has evolved over the last 30 years or so, but one thing that really I think was great for me, as a woman, I think also for \u2013 just for people in general to hear was her comment about how important it is for people to ask for what they want their careers to be, and to be open with their ambitions.\n\nWhat, like a remarkable and kind of simple comment, but also think that I think you made this comment, a lot of people don\u2019t do, and I was just really struck by that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I \u2013 it is so important, you know, and it\u2019s two parts, I think, like you have to be clear with yourself about what it is you want, and why you want it, but \u2013 and then you need to tell people and act on it, you know, and I think this is consistent good advice that a lot of people give. Like Warren Buffett\u2019s advice is, the best investment you can make is in yourself, and it always amazes me, like how self-conscious people feel sometimes about expressing their ambition and asking for help and opportunity, and like things that \u2013 I think they\u2019d be really surprised at how open people would be to like getting on the journey with them.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I mean, I totally agree, and I think it\u2019s a few things. I think, one, it\u2019s that there is kind of this idea in society that maybe you\u2019re not supposed to do that, right, that you\u2019re supposed to, you know, be more humble, be less outward with your ambitions. I know that\u2019s true, especially for women, which is one of the reasons why I really appreciated what Lisa said, and I appreciate, especially, having people like her as examples to the rest of us, but I think the other thing, to your point about asking for help, I think a lot of us are just afraid to admit we might need help, even though, when someone asks us for help, I think very few of us ever would look at that as anything but wanting to offer that if we can, and certainly not looking upon that request with judgment.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Or, or if you make it a judgment at all, like the judgment is like, thank God this person is asking for help, because like \u2013 you know, we\u2019re aligned in wanting to get something ambitious done, and if they need help, like please ask for the help as soon as you need it.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, no, you\u2019re exactly right, and think, even though these things, like make sense, and we hear very successful people say these things, I think that it can hard for us to sometimes take that action on, but again, I  think it\u2019s so great that we have people like Lisa who are examples of this. Her career is so interesting, and what\u2019s been happening in, you know, silicon and computing and GPUs over the last five, six, seven, eight years has been just remarkable. And AMD has been leading the way with that, and \u2013 for you as a person who is both into hardware and software, was there a moment when you kind of started to notice, okay, we\u2019re now back to where things are interesting again?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I really do think it\u2019s been the past two or three years, and I don\u2019t mean to throw any kind of shade, whatsoever, on the mobile revolution, because I \u2013 like I was one of the leaders in one of the companies that, like helped with the mobile revolution. I was very excited about it, but there is a thing that we are returning to now that I haven\u2019t seen since the beginning of the internet, where you just have an abundance of compute, all up, and like lots of interesting ideas with this new AI platform about what to go do with it, and you know, it feels really liberating in a sense, like just the things I can imagine doing with it, and then just seeing everybody around me, like having these great ideas, and then having a platform that they can go use to try these ideas out, like it feels very internet-ish to me.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, I think that I think I agree with you. At first, I was a little bit hesitant because I think I have a stronger affinity towards, like what the mobile revolution meant, but if I\u2019m being honest, a lot of the ideas of the mobile revolution, we were not ready. We didn\u2019t have the compute to really take advantage of what people wanted to do, and I think maybe that\u2019s the difference, whereas, when the internet became a thing, we were at the point where the hardware technology and the software were aligned, and so it felt limitless, and with mobile, it took a few years for mobile chipsets to become powerful and for wireless internet to become powerful enough, but now I think \u2013 to your point, I do feel like maybe we are at that correct alignment where we have these massive amounts of compute, thanks to companies like AMD, that people can access from the cloud, you know? Or they can build their own threadripper if they want to be like you, but they have access to the compute, and so we can finally make \u2013 the two goals are aligned.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s exciting to see entrepreneurs be entrepreneurs, like it really, really is. Like, I can\u2019t even imagine what I would be doing if I were, you know, like a 20-something-year-old young engineer right now, like it would \u2013 it\u2019s exciting for me, as \u2013 you know, like an older engineer, later in my career, but like I would just be so happy right now and so energized, you know, to have all of this power to go do crazy things that were hard to imagine just a year ago.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Oh, yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And just imagining, like everything that is still ahead of us, it\u2019s so much fun right now.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I completely agree, it\u2019s so much fun, I \u2013 and I\u2019m with you. If I were in my early twenties, I think I would definitely \u2013 I\u2019d probably be at an AI startup, right, and because there\u2019s so much \u2013 exciting things happening, and it \u2013 and as you said, it does just kind of feel like one of those moments where the possibilities are limitless and a lot of that is because of the hardware, like hardware is sexy again, and that hadn\u2019t been the case for a long time.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Absolutely true, and yeah, and like, to my, you know, compiler nerd/computer architect nerd beginnings, like makes me very happy.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Definitely. Well, that is all we\u2019ve got today. A big thanks to Lisa Su for joining us.
