{"episode": "Ep-46 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Simone-Giertz", "text": "SIMONE GIERTZ: in making and building things it\u2019s like, when you start, you think that there\u2019s, like, one right way of doing it and it\u2019s like, no, there\u2019s a hundred different ways of doing it. And maybe five of those are really good and 40 of those are really bad. But it\u2019s like you can \u2013 there are so many different ways to \u2013 to skin a cat. But why would you want to skin a cat? (Laughter.)\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we\u2019re going to get behind the tech. We\u2019ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what\u2019s happening today. Stick around.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Hello and welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m cohost, Christina Warren, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And I\u2019m Kevin Scott.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And today, we are talking to Simone Giertz, who is an incredible inventor, roboticist and maker of all kinds.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Simone has been one of my favorite YouTubers for years. I was so incredibly excited when she agreed to be on the program today. I\u2019ve just wanted to talk to her for a really long time. She is an inspiration to me, as someone who likes to make things. Like, I watch her videos and learn a bunch of things and get inspired about things that I then want to go do myself. \n\nBut the thing that I really admire about her is the example that she\u2019s setting for other people, sort of teaching you that if you, you know, have a little bit of curiosity and determination and you\u2019re, you know, you let yourself be a little bit fearless, like, you can really do anything.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Now, I know you\u2019ve been a \u2013 you\u2019re a huge fan of hers, and I can\u2019t wait to hear the two of you talk shop, no pun intended.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, awesome.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Simone Giertz is a Swedish inventor maker, robotics enthusiast, TV host, professional YouTuber, and most recently, entrepreneur. She briefly studied engineering physics at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and has since built a career creating amazing things and sharing the process of their creation with the world. Giertz builds robots that do all kinds of impractical and funny things, like an alarm clock that slaps the user, a lipstick applier, and famously, a toothbrush helmet that launched her YouTube career. She\u2019s an inspiration to everyone who follows her. \n\nSimone, thank you so much for joining us today.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Thank you. Thanks for having me. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, so maybe we can start our conversation with your childhood and how you got interested in making.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: I mean, for me, it didn\u2019t really start in my childhood, to be honest. Like, I was always interested in making things, but \u2013 and I remember, I mean, I studied woodworking in school and stuff like \u2013 like, I\u2019m from Sweden and all kids do that and sewing. And I really enjoyed it, and I was always like a very free range kid and kind of just running around and making my own mistakes and trying to figure things out. \n\nBut I definitely wasn\u2019t like a tech whiz kid. Like, my brother was. He was always picking apart computers and learning programming, and I was like, no, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s for me. And then it wasn\u2019t until I was 23, 24, where I remember it, like, hitting me and being like, \u201cwow, this is so cool.\u201d But I never saw myself as somebody who would think that that stuff was interesting. Yeah, but then once I did, it was just like full force ahead.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Do you remember what the inspiration was, like that moment that you had when you were 23, 24 years old, that made you think, wow, this is something I\u2019d like to do?\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: You know, I think it\u2019s, really for me, it\u2019s the thing that excites me about tools, and I do really think of programming as a tool, is when you realize what you can use it to do. Like, I was never excited about them on their own. It was more like, wait, so you\u2019re telling me if I learn how to program just, like, basic JavaScript and CSS, then I can make a website where there\u2019s head \u2013 like, hair growing out of the screen. And I can turn my cursor into a razor blade and I can shave that fake hair off, you know? So, it was just, for me, it was like \u2013 it was very much once I realized, like, all the stupid, silly stuff I could do with it, yeah\u2026 \n\nBut since then, I mean, I haven\u2019t written a line of code in years. I\u2019ll, like, still write some, like, basic motor program, but that was a couple of years ago. I did code a lot and I was \u2013 I started getting into electronics and programming mostly Arduinos, but now, I\u2019m just, like, very hardcore into woodworking and welding and have been enjoying that part of making a lot more.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, I \u2013 I\u2019ve watched some of your\u2026 actually, I\u2019ve seen all of your videos. Like, you have no idea how excited I was to be able to get to chat with you. So, I \u2013 and this must be a weird thing, too. You\u2019re putting so much of your life there, and you\u2019ve got a complete stranger like me who comes along and, like, wants to ask about how Scraps is doing. And, you know, is that C&C machine still working for you in LA, I mean, like, it\u2019s weird, right?\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: I think, in part, I\u2019ve gotten used to it, but it\u2019s also like\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to say this without sounding cheesy, but I do think that who I am on the Internet is a pretty good representation of who I am in real life. So, it\u2019s never like, oh, they don\u2019t know the real me. Like, they \u2013 like, people who watch my videos do know a side of me. \n\nSo, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s mostly just hard because I\u2019m like, oh, but I feel guilty because I\u2019m like, I should know things about you, too. It almost feels like when you\u2019re like, hanging out with somebody and they remember so many things you said, and you\u2019re like, I can\u2019t even remember where you live.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, so I want to really get into the hardcore makery stuff, but I did want to say, like, one of the things that I love so much about how you make your videos is you just allow yourself to be vulnerable on camera. Like, you show the whole process. Like, you get excited about a project, like, stuff doesn\u2019t work. You get really upset about it not working. Then you, like, stick with it and, like, make it work. \n\nLike, I was, just this past week, I was rewatching the stained glass window video and, like, I\u2019m going on this journey with you. Like I\u2019ve done so many of these things myself and, like, the water\u2019s leaking out of this thing. I\u2019m like, oh my God, I know exactly how that feels. (Laughter.)\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: I mean, it\u2019s like building is messy and it\u2019s always, like, frustrating. And then when you do get it to work, it\u2019s, like, exhilarating. And I think for me, it was always discouraging to watch videos where people just nailed it, because then I would feel like I was doing something wrong, because I\u2019m like, my builds never feel like that. Like, they\u2019re always \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s, like, the difference between, like, the really beautiful Instagram vacation photo versus, like, what it actually was. And you\u2019re like, I was kind of cold and hungry and, like, upset with my dad or whatever. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just trying to be transparent. Plus, like, the thing is, when bad things happen in builds, I\u2019m always \u2013 I get so annoyed with it. But then when I\u2019m editing the footage, I\u2019m always kind of happy that it happened because I\u2019m like, oh, that\u2019s where the story is at. And it\u2019s also like, it is nice to see, like, how I can overcome those adversities. Like, even for myself, I\u2019m like, yeah, I did solve it and I was really upset and I felt like I wasn\u2019t going to come around on top. And then I managed to finagle my way through it somehow.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and I don\u2019t know how you think about it philosophically, about just the whole struggle of making things. Like, being a creator, whether you\u2019re writing software or making a company or building a project or whatnot, like, there\u2019s a whole bunch of things that can make that go easier. It\u2019s good if you\u2019re curious. It\u2019s good if you\u2019re willing to explore. But, like, the thing that you show is that resilience is super important. Like, nothing ever goes perfectly. \n\nAnd I felt this, you know, the same way when I was a young software engineer. Like, all you ever saw was the computer science paper that someone had written where they got into all of the answers, and you saw none of the process, how they got there. And you just felt so bad about yourself that you\u2019re imagining how much easier it must have been for everybody else when in reality, it wasn\u2019t.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: The thing is, I think, yeah, it\u2019s resilience, but also for me, the reason that I am resilient in these situations is because I\u2019m so genuinely excited about what I\u2019m doing. If I wasn\u2019t pumped about it, then I\u2019d be like, whatever. I\u2019ll just move on and, like, go play video games instead. But since I\u2019m like, I really want to pursue this and push it through and, like, make this build come to life, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s making me resilient. And also just because I think I am really stubborn. \n\nBut it\u2019s not that I\u2019m like, oh, I have to push myself and work harder and, like, be really disciplined about it. It\u2019s mostly that I\u2019m just, like, lying in bed at 3 a.m., being like, oh, I can solve it like this, or what about if I do that, and my brain just kind of can\u2019t let it go because I really want to see it, see it through.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s awesome. Well, so maybe we can talk a little bit about how you get the inspiration to make the things that you make, because you do \u2013 you have chosen over the years to make a bunch of interesting things\u2026 that are not \u2013 I mean, and if you watch makers on YouTube, there\u2019s a lot of\u2026 I don\u2019t even know whether...it\u2019s not that people are copying each other, but there seem like there are these things, like everybody in woodworking goes and makes an epoxy river table at the same time. And like, there are these trends and, like, the things that you do are just so unique to you. How do you do that?\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m setting that bar for myself. I\u2019ve just always been like, I want it to be something that you haven\u2019t really seen before or a spin on something in a way that you haven\u2019t done before. And I think it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s because it\u2019s what I\u2019m most interested in making, but it\u2019s also because I am \u2013 I think it has to do with the platform that I\u2019m creating for. So, it is now YouTube and social media, and then I\u2019m always like, what\u2019s the hook? What\u2019s the interesting thing? \n\nAnd then if I \u2013 I think if I\u2019m being totally honest, if I was just making stuff for myself, then it would still be in that realm. But I probably wouldn\u2019t push myself as hard. But now, I\u2019m just always like, you know, in some way I think it might all \u2013 like, almost be insecurities because I\u2019m, like, to justify to exist in the space, I feel like I have to present something really unique. \n\nAnd I\u2019m always like \u2013 because there are so many different videos I could be making and I\u2019m like, it\u2019s not interesting enough. I don\u2019t feel like I can ask people to spend time watching this if it\u2019s not elevated in some way. And I do think that has a little bit to do with, like, insecurities or, like, being apologetic about taking up space, which goes very against, like, being on YouTube. \n\nBut then I think it\u2019s also just what I\u2019m interested in. And I love, like, trying to find unique solutions to everyday problems. And that\u2019s also what I\u2019ve been doing now, trying to transform or, like, apply that thinking to product design. So, it\u2019s like making things for YouTube, but then also using those same kind of qualifiers to develop products and try to create for that arena as well, which is, like, a whole other world.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I mean, already, the \u2013 the things that you are making, so you have a new online store called Yetch, Y-E-T-C-H.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: I\u2019m very proud of how I managed to segue into that because it did actually come very naturally. (Laughter.) Did I mention that I also have a product store and where I\u2019m trying to apply this thinking. Felt very pro.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter.) But you just are making some of the coolest stuff. So, the \u2013 the everyday calendar that you make is such an awesome idea just because it\u2019s general purpose. Like, you can use it for any practice you\u2019ve got, and you created it for a meditation practice you were trying to do?\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: I wanted to meditate every day. So, I made this calendar that\u2019s kind of like a year. I still don\u2019t know how to elevate or pitch it without, like visuals, but it represents a whole year. And if you tap a day, you can light it up. So, you can be like, did I meditate today? And you get to tap it, and it\u2019s like, almost like a little gold star. \n\nBut I\u2019ve seen, I mean, what\u2019s really fun about that product is people are using it in ways I never expected it to. I mean, there\u2019s people who use them as period trackers or, like, how often they water their plants or if they took their medicine. So, it\u2019s like very just, like, here\u2019s something that I found useful for this, but maybe you can find it useful for other things.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it\u2019s amazing. And then, we were just talking about it. I have a \u2013 I\u2019m sitting in the middle of a shop right now, so my office is a machine shop and woodworking studio. \n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Oh wow, lucky you.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, like there\u2019s \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s all \u2013 all of this stuff off of cameras and. And so, like, I work with some people here. And we were talking about your, like, Philips head screwdriver ring and, like, what a great idea everybody thought it was. They were like, oh yeah, I wish I had that. Like, I had something this morning where it would have been useful.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah. No, it is. It\u2019s been really, really fun. I\u2019m like manufacturing is\u2026 a pain. It is. It is \u2013 it is, yeah. I feel like everybody\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s almost like hearing people talk about parenting and anyone who has kids is going to be like, having kids is so hard. And it\u2019s the same for manufacturing where people are just like, it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s really, really hard. \n\nAnd, like, the everyday calendar, especially because now, a lot of the other products that we\u2019ve added to the roster, and it\u2019s still just, like, a seedling of a product company, don\u2019t have any electronics in it. And I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t know if I ever want to do another electronics product \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 because, like, the amount of things that can go wrong with it and we\u2019re using capacitive touch, which is very reliable. But I mean, there are thousands of calendars out in the world there now and living happy lives. \n\nBut yeah, it\u2019s definitely, as somebody who\u2019s terrified of disappointing people, I\u2019m like, couldn\u2019t I have a dream that meshed well with my personal anxieties and wasn\u2019t, like, one of the most triggering things where you\u2019re like, we\u2019re sending out thousands of puzzles, and what if something\u2019s wrong with them? What if the boxes come scratched? What if somebody\u2019s going to be disappointed and sad? But so far, so good.\n\nAnd it\u2019s honestly \u2013 it\u2019s just \u2013 it feels really nice to be able to, like, find not a life beyond YouTube, but, like, something else to do and something else to, like, revive the purpose of my YouTube channel for me, because it\u2019s like I\u2019ve never had as a goal to have the world\u2019s biggest YouTube channel or been feeling, like, super motivated by the numbers. \n\nSo then, it\u2019s like, okay, what do I want to use this for? And like, being a product designer has been a dream that I\u2019ve had almost my whole life. And I remember being a kid and I was, like, kind of wanting to go into, like, interior design. And I was always, like, redecorating my room. But then I didn\u2019t think it was cool enough because it felt too conventional. So, I was like, no, I\u2019m not going to do that. \n\nAnd then when I was going into college, I was always like, I\u2019m going to study physics because it\u2019s the hardest you can do. And I want to prove to myself that I\u2019m smart. And then I dropped out after a year because I was like, no, this is not \u2013 I don\u2019t think this is that fun.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter.) Well, so let\u2019s talk a little bit, if you are okay with it, about the process of making the everyday calendar. So, you get the idea for this thing. Like, then, what do you go do, because\u2026 Did you start with the intention that you were going to make a thing to be manufactured and sold to other people?\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Not at all. And I think that\u2019s what I want to retain as well. Like, I\u2019m always, and for YouTube as well, I\u2019m making things for an audience of one. (Laughter.) Like, I\u2019m making something because I really want it. And then if other people find it interesting, then great. \n\nSo, I made it. I made this version of it that had a bunch of toggle switches, so it was 365 toggle switches. And I just did it as \u2013 as a video. It was untested, so it was on the YouTube channel. And then it, like, actually worked really well for me and I started wanting to think of, like, if it could be a product. \n\nThe problem with any product where you have 365 of a component is, like, cost just immediately starts taking off, and there was no way for us to have mechanical buttons or toggle switches or anything in a calendar. And I remember us wanting \u2013 I kind of wanted it to almost look like an elevator button grid, but, like, smaller. But it would have been like a $1,000 product, which I didn\u2019t want. \n\nSo, we ended up using capacitive touch because it\u2019s \u2013 it can just be in software. You just need some special chips to monitor the capacitive touch, and actually ended up using circuit board as the front plate. So, it\u2019s this, like, designed, very embellished looking circuit board, but if you\u2019re looking close, closer at it, you can see all the traces. \n\nSo, that was really fun. It was a fun design challenge to take these materials that are not really meant to be consumer facing and try to make them look really pretty and beautiful enough for you to want to hang it on a wall.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And just the  process of creating and who you\u2019re collaborating with, had you ever laid a circuit board out before? Had you, like \u2013 \n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: I had done some PCB design before, but very minimal. So, I started working with an electrical engineer, and a mechanical engineer and just some other people. Like, we were really just a small team of friends and trying to put it together. We did a Kickstarter campaign, raised some money, shipped those out a couple of months late after a lot of headache. But, like, we managed to get them out. \n\nAnd \u2013 and yeah. And now, we\u2019re finally like the pandemic unfortunately came in between there with all the chip shortages and stuff like that. So, our BOM cost, so our bill of materials went up with, like, 40%, which just made it an unfeasible product for us. So, we kind of had to hold off on manufacturing more. And now, we\u2019re looking at \u2013 we just had another batch come in and now, we\u2019re looking at adding another batch. \n\nBut it is \u2013 there\u2019s some reliability things we\u2019re working on to think about, because we have 365 LEDs. The fault rate of an LED normally is, like, one in 10,000 over a couple of years, which sounds reasonable, but that means that, like, one in 30 calendars can get an issue down the line, like, a couple of years down the line. So, we\u2019re replacing those.\n\nBut there has been a lot of, like, trying to figure out how to increase the lifespan of the LEDs and doing a lot of stress testing, seeing if we can reduce the heat when we\u2019re soldering them and, you know, a lot of different things. And that\u2019s like, you know, you kind of think that you design a product, and you put it out there and you\u2019re like, done. But there is a lot of iterating, and trying to figure out how to improve it and how to make it a better experience, both for the manufacturer, and for us and for the customers. \n\nSo, I\u2019m learning so much and it\u2019s really \u2013 it is, like\u2026 I can\u2019t, even looking back like two years ago, I\u2019m thinking of how much I\u2019ve learned and that\u2019s really nice. It\u2019s like a lot of \u2013 because we\u2019re learning by doing and there\u2019s not \u2013 we\u2019re a really, like, skilled, but young team and it\u2019s\u2026 You know, I just feel really fortunate to be able to do it, and to be able to do it this way and to be able to do it on my own terms and kind of follow the whims of my creativity. It\u2019s\u2026 Yeah, I\u2019m just stoked.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s just awesome stuff. And it for a curious person, it seems like the way that you\u2019re doing things, like, you\u2019ve got a lot of surface area for your curiosity to explore \u2013 \n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: (Laughter.) That\u2019s the nice way of putting it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Because it\u2019s not like you\u2019re just building a bunch of electronic products. Like, I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m just super curious. So, you \u2013 you\u2019re making these rings. Are they cast and machined or\u2026\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: So, the rings are manufactured. They\u2019re not cast, they\u2019re not 3D printed. We looked into doing some of that, but since we wanted to actually be a functional tool, the screwdriver ring, you just can\u2019t get the hardness of the material using that. So, they\u2019re all machined.\n\nAnd then the screw ring was really tricky to figure out how to do. So basically, it\u2019s a ring. It looks like a Phillips head screw, but then it\u2019s, like, embedded into a normal kind of signet ring. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: And the way you manufacture screws is you kind of have this, like, rod of metal come and then they stamp the screw head into it, kind of stamp that face into it. And we couldn\u2019t really do that because it would deform the ring too much, and also, that tooling would be incredibly complex to make. \n\nSo, what we ended up doing is using lasers to do it and the amount of precision \u2013 like, the amount of time we spent coupling the screwdriver ring and the screw ring with other items, and trying to see if they, like, hold in place or fall out, just because we want that really good fit, it\u2019s just \u2013 you know, you go in such detail. In a way, I\u2019m like, no customer is ever going to notice this, but also, like, knowing that we can get it to that level where we\u2019re feeling really happy with it, it\u2019s like we\u2019re not going to be able to stay away from it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, and I love that. There are other makers out there, like one of my favorite YouTube makers is this guy, John Grimsmo, who makes knives. And, like, they are super obsessed with knives. \n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: They make every last thing. They make their own bearings. They make \u2013 like, every piece of that knife is custom machined in their machine shop. And like, it\u2019s completely unnecessary, but so awesome.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah. I just love it when people are excited about something and almost, in particular, they\u2019re excited about something that I\u2019m not, because I\u2019m always like, how? What is it about it that just gets you ticking and, like, gets you so in \u2013 want to get into the nitty gritty of it all? I don\u2019t know.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I feel the same way. When I watch other makers, sometimes, I\u2019m watching it to learn something that I am going to go reproduce. And sometimes, I watch it just to, like, see how fascinating other human beings are in expressing their creativity. Like, I would never in a million years, like, you know, know \u2013 and this is not a ding on the product \u2013 like, it would never occur to me to put a Phillips head screwdriver tip on \u2013 on a ring. But I love that you did. Like, it\u2019s just amazing.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah, I feel like everybody\u2019s brain is, like, in their own corner of creativity. And you go and you see something that some other maker or some other artists and make \u2013 is making, and you\u2019re like, wow, you\u2019re just having a blast over there. And that\u2019s, like, your arena. And I definitely feel like I have my own little pod and, like, kind of the area that I\u2019m making in. And, yeah, but\u2026\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, I have to mention your puzzle as well. So, my wife\u2019s pandemic obsession, like the thing that she would do when she was, like, just completely overwhelmed with the stress of being locked in a house with two little kids and a cranky husband, was she would go just work on a puzzle. Like, we had a big table set up and there was a puzzle on it at all times, and she would solve it. And she \u2013 I would buy her puzzles. And evidently, my taste in puzzles is Godawful, because I would buy her ones that were just the most miserably hard to solve. \n\nAnd then I saw yours, which is a, what, a 500-piece puzzle? It\u2019s all white and you randomly remove a piece \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 \n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: A piece from every puzzle, yes. So, you get 499 out of 500 pieces. And it is, as far as I\u2019m concerned, the world\u2019s first officially incomplete puzzle. Yeah, I came up with the idea of this, like, years and years ago, or I think maybe like three years ago. And I came out of the bathroom, and I was laughing so hard that I couldn\u2019t stop laughing long enough to tell my friend what I was laughing about. (Laughter.) And I still don\u2019t. \n\nAnd then it\u2019s like it goes so long where I\u2019m like, is the joke still there? You know, you spend so much time with it and so much time, like, designing the boxes and thinking about it. And then you\u2019re like, is this still funny? And sometimes, it\u2019s like trying to look at your hands and being like, are these normal looking hands? \n\nBut I\u2019m still I just think\u2026 You know, the thing that blows my mind the most about it is that people are, like, down for the joke. And I mean, it\u2019s just sometimes, you take a step back and I\u2019m like, we\u2019ve sold, like, 1,000 incomplete puzzles and it\u2019s just so bizarre. But yeah, here we are. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But it\u2019s a hilarious joke. I told my wife I\u2019m going to order her one. I told her about it and she was like, why would she do that? (Laughter.)\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: I know! It\u2019s like the most wholesome, villainous thing to do. (Laughter.) Like, there\u2019s no harm in it, but it\u2019s really like \u2013 people are like, why? Why? But the funny thing is, because I put together this puzzle two times now, three in total with another iteration, and when you realize which piece is the missing piece, it\u2019s almost the most fun part of the puzzle, because I mean, all the other parts are miserable, really, but it\u2019s like where you\u2019re like, oh, that\u2019s the one. And it\u2019s almost more of a satisfaction to find the one that\u2019s missing. But yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, and the completed puzzles actually I mean, there\u2019s something almost like you should frame it and hang it in the Museum of Modern Art. Like, the \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 it says something, but both the fact that a human being would have the patience to go spend all of this time on a thing that can\u2019t be finished, as well as the aesthetic of the \u2013 this stark white puzzle missing one piece, I \u2013 I think it\u2019s very clever, very clever.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: I mean, it\u2019s spending time on this thing that\u2019s not going to be finished. But also, like, generally, when you work with a jigsaw puzzle, when you\u2019re done, you just crumble \u2013 crumble it all together anyway. So, it\u2019s like \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: But it is, it\u2019s interesting how much of a\u2026 I was going to say eyesore but almost, like, thought-sore it is because you\u2019re always like, oh, it\u2019s not going to be worth it because it\u2019s missing a piece. And you\u2019re like, and that\u2019s what I wrote on the box. I had a lot of fun writing all the copy text for the puzzle. And what I wrote on the box was like, this piece \u2013 this puzzle has one piece that\u2019s missing and 499 that aren\u2019t. And it\u2019s almost this thing of like, it\u2019s so easy to just focus on that one thing that\u2019s wrong. And then you\u2019re like, oh, but there\u2019s so much that is right, and that is just the way I wanted it to be, but\u2026\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and one of the things that I love are the never finished things, because so much of what I spend my time doing, like, it has to get finished. You can\u2019t \u2013 you can\u2019t run a business without finishing things. But in my personal life, I love unfinished things. And folks asked me a lot, I\u2019ve got this shop and they ask me, oh, what\u2019s the \u2013 what\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve built in the shop or the thing that you\u2019re proudest about in the shop? And I\u2019m like, well, it\u2019s kind of the shop itself and it\u2019s never finished. (Laughter.)\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah, yeah. But that\u2019s also such a different area of making, because I\u2019ve never \u2013 I haven\u2019t gotten to the point or my brain hasn\u2019t latched on to, like, shop layout as a fun project to work on. I\u2019m just like, I just want it to work. Like, my shop is a mess. I call it the butthole of the house because I\u2019m like, just let it be ugly. Like, it\u2019s just going to \u2013 it\u2019s just there for its function. \n\nAnd then I\u2019ve been thinking of like, oh, I should really get better about structuring things, but it just hasn\u2019t, like \u2013 it hasn\u2019t clicked for me yet where I\u2019m like, oh, that brings me a lot of satisfaction, but I think I\u2019ll get there eventually. But it\u2019s also I\u2019m just a messy person in general, and I\u2019m always leaving a trail of projects behind me.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But I \u2013 I think that\u2019s fine.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah, but sometimes, I\u2019m like, I wish I was \u2013 I wish I was that person and that I was that person who was like, I\u2019m going to make labels for things and not just throw them into random bins. But I mean, there\u2019s pros and cons to every setup. I do move fast, so there\u2019s that.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, I mean, the way that I think about my working environments, I can be incredibly messy, but what I like about my shop is I walk into it and everything is where it\u2019s supposed to be, and it\u2019s clean and it is ready for action. It\u2019s all potential energy. And it makes me \u2013 and this is what I need as a creator. I need to walk into situations, and I get inspired by the possibility that sits in the order.\n\nAnd I know other people who are, like, way, way more creative than I am, who have completely different processes and it\u2019s okay. Like, it\u2019s fascinating to me, like, how everybody works.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah, to me, it\u2019s like step one is always clear a big enough space on my workbench where I can work on the project. (Laughter.) It\u2019s always, like, just pushing things off to the side. But there\u2019s still \u2013 I still have hope that I\u2019m going to be one of those neat people, but it\u2019s like \u2013 also, like, doing machine maintenance and stuff, I\u2019m just\u2026\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, and then it\u2019s working with other people is sort of fun, too, right? Like, I \u2013share this shop with, like, someone who works with me, and it took us a while to figure out, like, hey, here\u2019s our \u2013 here\u2019s our dynamic.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah, and that\u2019s also, if you\u2019re sharing a space with somebody, then I\u2019m all for being clean and stuff. And I will, like \u2013 the only time I will really properly clean my house is if somebody\u2019s coming over. But when it\u2019s just left to my own devices, especially in the workshop, it\u2019s like, yeah, it\u2019s just pure chaos. And then I\u2019ll have fits of cleaning and be really orderly for all of 25 minutes, but yeah\u2026\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter.) So what \u2013 what interesting stuff are you doing now? You mentioned woodworking and welding.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah. Oh, I was just \u2013 welding because I was just welding today. Oh, I\u2019m working \u2013 Oh, I love this project so much. It has been the most interesting engineering challenge and I\u2019m just stoked about it. I\u2019m making a music instrument that pops bubble wrap. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh. (Laughter.)\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: So, it\u2019s like, you know like those little music boxes that have, like, the little barrels with spikes on it and it plays a tune. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yep.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: So, imagine that, but it\u2019s bigger and you feed in a sheet of bubble wrap and it pops different bubbles. And the bubbles popping resonate in different length tubes. So, it actually plays different notes. So, right now, I\u2019m at like a very fun part of the build where I\u2019m going to \u2013 I\u2019m probably \u2013 tomorrow, I\u2019ll probably have a first attempt at a final assembly. So, I have almost all the parts. I still need to C&C and machine some \u2013 the \u2013 some wood parts, but it\u2019s all, like, coming together. And it\u2019s probably not going to work, so there\u2019s most likely going to be a rev 2. \n\nBut yeah, I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m just stoked about the concept. I think it\u2019s so fun and I\u2019m just \u2013 it\u2019s one of those ideas where you\u2019re like, I think of it and then I\u2019m like, somebody must have done this. Like, there is no way nobody has done this. And then I, like, Google, and you get to the bottom of the image search or you, like, search on YouTube and you can\u2019t find anything. And you\u2019re like, nobody\u2019s done this. (Laughter.) And yeah, so I\u2019m stoked. It\u2019s been a fun project on every level so far, and \u2013 and really complicated, but super fun.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It sounds crazy complicated, actually.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: It has been crazy complicated, but I\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019ve started working\u2026 Like, one of the push and pulls of my career is in the beginning, I was so stubborn about putting in, like, every screw myself. And I think a part of it is, like, being a woman in a field with not a lot of women, and I always felt like I was always wanting to be ready. If anyone questioned my skills or questioned who had build a \u2013 built a project, I would be able to say, like, no, I did absolutely everything. No dude ever touched this project. \n\nBut then, like, in recent years, I really like \u2013 I love working with other people. It\u2019s so fun to problem solve with other people, and I\u2019ve started working with this engineer. He helped me on the companion chair, and the puzzle table and the scissor lamp. So, we\u2019ll like design it together in Fusion and sit and problem solve together. And it\u2019s let me, like \u2013 I\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019m learning so much. It\u2019s letting me do much more complex projects than I would have the bandwidth to do myself. \n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s been super fun to just, like, try to solve these incredibly specific problems. Like, I spent probably a week just popping bubble wrap, trying to figure out the optimal shape and surface to pop bubbles reliably and to make sure that we could perfectly control pop location, because it needs to pop within a very small area for it to resonate in the tube. And just, like, getting to spend so much time on such specific problems is \u2013 is such a treat.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Do you do any 3D printing for prototyping?\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah. Yeah, I do. So, it\u2019s \u2013 the first thing I tend to grab for is my laser cutter because it\u2019s always the fastest. Like, you can do something within a couple of minutes. But then 3D printing and then last is just C&C\u2019ing. So, it\u2019s nice to have like things in different tiers of prototyping. But yeah, this \u2013 this build is going to have some 3D printed elements, but most of it is going to be C&C\u2019d. And I got a rotary kit for my C&C so I could make the barrel on the \u2013 on the C&C, which was a whole new learning experience, but very fun.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That sounds fun. And you\u2019ve got an Avid C&C machine that you put together yourself?\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, those are super cool. \n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: I love it. It was such a game changer for me. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, it\u2019s really interesting. I\u2019ve been a woodworker since I was a teenager, which is \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 I\u2019m older than you, so that\u2019s a very long time ago. And, like, one of the funny things that I\u2019ve seen in woodworking over the years is you have people who try to define what real woodworking is. So, there are, like, some who are like, oh, if it\u2019s anything but hand tools, it\u2019s not real woodworking. And then, like, people now are saying, oh, well, if you use a C&C and not just hand power tools, it\u2019s not real woodworking, which always struck me as\u2026 I mean, and no \u2013 no disrespect.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: If you didn\u2019t \u2013 if you didn\u2019t fell the tree yourself \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I love \u2013 I love those handwork traditions.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Did you not grow the tree and then fell it and dry it? Then no, it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not woodworking. (Laughter.) Yeah, I think it\u2019s always like\u2026 I get it, but I mean, it\u2019s the same with, like, when GPSs were starting to come out and people were like, oh, it\u2019s not real driving if you have a device help you navigate around the city. Like, to me, it\u2019s just it\u2019s all parts of the same coin and you\u2019re comfortable with different tools. \n\nAnd it\u2019s like, for me, as somebody who started in electronics and started in kind of computer design, it\u2019s been such a \u2013 for me, the C&C kind of perfectly came into my build process because I\u2019m always making drafts in the computer anyway. And I\u2019m using Illustrator and Fusion to design it, and then being able to pop that onto a machine, like the first thing I grab for is never really, like, a knife and a piece of wood, and I start, like, carving something out. \n\nSo, I think it\u2019s just all like \u2013 we just think of the world in different terms. And for me, I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019ve always thought computer first. And \u2013 \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: It\u2019s just different. There\u2019s so many ways you can solve a problem. And I think that\u2019s one of the things, like, that I\u2019ve learned in \u2013 in making and building things, is, like, when you start, you almost \u2013 you think that there\u2019s, like, one right way of doing it and it\u2019s like, no, there\u2019s a hundred different ways of doing it. And maybe five of those are really good and 40 of those are really bad. But it\u2019s like you can \u2013 there are so many different ways to \u2013 to skin a cat. But why would you want to skin a cat? (Laughter.) It\u2019s such a weird expression.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter.) Yeah, I\u2019ve never understood that metaphor.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah, there are so many ways to build a chair. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes, correct. (Laughter.) Yeah, one of the things that really inspires me about how you approach making, and Adam Savage does the same thing, is you have so many tools in your arsenal. And, you know, one of the things that I used to \u2013 the lies I used to tell myself is like, oh, I can\u2019t do X. Like, I am a woodworker, I can\u2019t be a machinist. Like, I work with wood. I can\u2019t weld stuff or do metalworking, which is just sort of a silly \u2013 silly, self-imposed set of constraints, because of course, you can do all of these things. \n\nAnd I just love watching you just having an idea and, like, you just apply so many different tools at the \u2013 at the \u2013 like, how do you\u2026 How did you get to that point, like not letting yourself get siloed as a \u2013 like, a maker of type X?\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: I mean, I can list the things that I never thought I would be able to do. It\u2019s like almost every skill I\u2019ve acquired at some point. Like, I remember thinking, oh, I could never program. And then you start and you\u2019re like, oh, this isn\u2019t \u2013 like, other people are doing this, so I can probably figure it out too. \n\nI didn\u2019t think I could solder. I remember being really scared the first time I soldered, and then you\u2019re like, oh, I can do this. I didn\u2019t think I could weld. I was terrified of welding. And then you have somebody show you the ropes, and then you\u2019re like, okay, I can do this. \n\nThe same with C&C\u2019ing. I was really reluctant to get into C&C\u2019ing because I was like, I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s so complicated and I feel like I could never learn and \u2013 or driving a car. I mean, it\u2019s like almost everything, it\u2019s like I run into, like, no, I could never do this. I can\u2019t. I\u2019m just not going to be good enough or be able to figure it out. And then you start and you\u2019re like, so silly of me to think that I couldn\u2019t do it because you\u2019ve just got to find the right way to learn, you know? \n\nIt took me three attempts to start learning Fusion, because \u2013 Fusion 360, because I would just get stuck on their instructional videos. And I was like, this is so complicated. And then you just find somebody who can teach you in a way that works for you or find a way to learn it. And it\u2019s \u2013 yeah. \n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: But I do remember, like, more in a branding way or, like, I was really nervous about getting pigeonholed as, like, the Queen of Shitty Robots, which is what I used to do. I used to only build, like, funny robots and weird machines, which I loved. And like, I\u2019ll still do that. I feel like a lot of the projects I do now draw a lot of \u2013 still have a lot of those elements. \n\nBut I was really happy to feel like I was able to move beyond that and expand beyond that, and have my audience kind of be down for the ride. I feel I\u2019ve \u2013 they\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019re just the most kind, supportive people and they\u2019re just like, oh, if you\u2019re excited about it, we\u2019re excited too, which is a very, very supportive community to have.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And \u2013 and, like, the breadth of this stuff that you work on all the way from the whimsical to some hardcore engineering things, like the Truck-la that you built, the \u2013 turning a model 3 Tesla into an El Camino or like a truck. \n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Like a truck, yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, crazy.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 you know, it\u2019s \u2013 I try to do things I\u2019m genuinely excited about and that does throw some curveballs.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter.) Which I \u2013 I think it\u2019s so \u2013 it\u2019s so inspiring. So, maybe last couple of questions before \u2013 before we go. So, one is \u2013 \n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: You\u2019re so \u2013 can I just say you\u2019re so sweet. I feel like I\u2019m just getting to sit here and have you say a bunch of really sweet and kind and thoughtful things. (Laughter.)\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter.) It\u2019s very nice. I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how big a fan I am of what you\u2019re doing. And one, because I\u2019m genuinely\u2026. genuinely, like, entertained and inspired by what you do. But, like, the thing that I really admire is what you\u2019re doing for other people.\n\nOne of the tragic things to me is folks going around the world thinking that they don\u2019t have agency over creativity and that, like, all of the stuff that they are consuming and that they use in their lives is \u2013 is magical and beyond their understanding or\u2026 And, like, you just inspire people to go past that, to say, like, hey, you know, we \u2013 all of these things were built by people. We can understand how they\u2019re built. We can go hack on them, like change them, modify them, make our own things. Like, that\u2019s a super powerful thing to be putting out into the world.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: I just think, for me, as well, it\u2019s so, like\u2026 things seem so set in stone. And, you know, I\u2019ve been thinking about, like, forks, for example, and I\u2019ve never questioned what a fork looks like. But you \u2013 then you realize, like, this is just built upon decisions that people have made. Somebody came up with this design and within these parameters, and it\u2019s just, like, generations of humans trying to improve on things, and then realizing I can be one of those people. \n\nAnd it\u2019s just such a \u2013 and you flail your way through it. (Laughter.) You flail and you futz, and then you get somewhere. And sometimes, you don\u2019t. And it\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s a really fun way, for me at least, to be in the world because it\u2019s like everything is malleable and, like, have \u2013 like, being able to have bought a house for the first time. And I\u2019m like, I can do anything. And you\u2019re like, does the window really need to be this way or could it be something else? Could it be something more fun?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I had a colleague one time, who I think had her PhD in robotics from Carnegie Mellon. And she was, like, one of our awesome product managers. And she \u2013 we were talking one day and she \u2013 she just was obsessed with home renovation stuff. \n\nAnd she\u2019s like, yeah, it\u2019s like these\u2026 I have people in my team who look at what I\u2019m doing, like knocking walls down, like, you know, that there\u2019s something behind the drywall, like the \u2013 the chest to Narnia, that there\u2019s magic behind there. (Laughter.) And she\u2019s like, I try to explain to them that, like, there\u2019s no magic. It\u2019s just, like, hey, I\u2019m interested in doing this. And like, I figured it all out.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah. You watch a lot of YouTube videos and then you figure it out. You watch a lot of YouTube videos and then you Google, what are the most common accidents people who do this have? Like, whenever I\u2019m learning a new tool, I\u2019m like, what are the most common accidents with, like, angle grinders? And then you\u2019re like, okay, these are the things I shouldn\u2019t do. (Laughter.)\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh, angle grinders. \n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah, they\u2019re terrifying.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. The closest I ever came to seriously injuring myself was with an angle grinder.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah, they\u2019ll do it.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: And a router table.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Oh, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Not good. (Laughter.) Well, so, maybe the last couple of questions. So, one is what are you sort of excited about in the future? Like, what\u2019s the thing that you don\u2019t know how to do right now that you \u2013 that you want to go figure out at some point in the future, like a thing you want to add to your arsenal of skills?\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: I do want to work more on vehicles. I\u2019m kind of on the lookout for another big vehicle project, but it\u2019s \u2013 I think I\u2019ve set the bar a little bit too high for myself because I\u2019m, like, trying to think of like Truck-la, and she\u2019s just a really hard act to follow. But I really want to do that and do more, more just vehicular stuff because that\u2019s such an interesting area. \n\nI also \u2013 I want to learn how to build houses. I really want to, like, at least design a house at some point, but that\u2019s a couple of years down the line. But then, now, it\u2019s just a lot of, like, product development. Design for manufacturing is a really interesting area. \n\nAnd honestly, like, a lot of the things that I\u2019m hoping to see the next couple of years is just, like, growing as a CEO. And in that leadership role, there\u2019s a lot of other parts to the business where it\u2019s like, you know when you grow up on YouTube or being a YouTuber and you\u2019re kind of, like, yeah. You\u2019re just this kid making videos in your living room. And then the business has just grown, and I\u2019m really excited to step more into that role and just, I don\u2019t know, learn about that. But, like, leadership is never something I\u2019ve really thought about, you know?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. But I \u2013 I think, just like everything else you\u2019re doing, like, you\u2019re going to be great at it. So as long as you approach it with humility and curiosity and, like, you\u2019re willing to try to introspect on what you\u2019re doing so that you can get better all the time, like, every \u2013 everybody starts out \u2013\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: I can just be like, hey, can I be on the podcast again? And you say a bunch of really sweet, encouraging things to me. (Laughter.)\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: if you ever need encouraging words about leadership, I can \u2013 I can absolutely offer them, because I remember when I \u2013 you know, nobody \u2013 I don\u2019t believe in this notion of born leader. Like, you\u2026 as soon as you find, like, a reason to be a leader, like there\u2019s a thing you want to help a bunch of other people accomplish, then it\u2019s just this journey of, like, how do I get better and better at doing that?\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah. And it\u2019s really like \u2013 it\u2019s such an individual like journey as well, because it\u2019s like I\u2019m running these businesses and I want to \u2013 I\u2019m figuring out what the company culture is and how I want it to be. Like, what do we actually prioritize in the business? How can you create a really, like, kind and supportive environment that\u2019s also productive? And I know it\u2019s not it\u2019s not looking like a normal enterprise and I want to retain some parts of that. \n\nBut then you\u2019re also like there is a lot of structure that is required. And yeah, there\u2019s just a lot of, like, you know, you try something and then you\u2019re like, did that \u2013 was that \u2013 did it feel right or was that right, or should I iterate and try to course correct? And there\u2019s definitely a lot of that, both in building, but also in running companies and in interacting with people or in, like, normal relationships. You\u2019re just always like, did this feel right or \u2013 or should I do it differently, and constantly trying to find better ways of being in the world.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Yes, and I think that\u2019s a perfect mindset. I mean, it\u2019s a really, really powerful thing, like waking up every day, just sort of reflecting on what you\u2019re doing and how you can get a little bit better at it, just step by step. \n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, last question: You do so much fun stuff for your job, but I ask everyone on the podcast, like, what they do in their, quote unquote, free time or leisure time when they\u2019re not working\u2026 for fun.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: It\u2019s been a struggle. Because if left to my own devices, I\u2019ll just keep on building things. So come Saturday, and I\u2019ll be like, I\u2019m going to work on some house projects, and then I just end up being more in the workshop and doing a lot of firing up my C&C and doing a lot of the same stuff. So, I\u2019ve just been trying to \u2013 my New Year\u2019s resolution was to try to make more friends and build more community, which is interesting because it\u2019s almost the thing that you just expect to happen. And I\u2019m like, no, I\u2019m actually going to make an effort. \n\nI moved to L.A. mid-2020, so, like, during the pandemic and I\u2019m still, like, I\u2019m just going to try to, like, meet more people and actually make an effort to, like, create that environment where, like, you can hang out and build community. So, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of that. I\u2019m just, like, trying to see a lot of people and be social.\n\nAnd then I spend a lot of time with my dog. That\u2019s really it. Like, we go to the park and I throw a stick repeatedly. She has a blast. I enjoy looking at her having a good time. And then we go home and we rest.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, she\u2019s \u2013 she\u2019s so cute.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: I just \u2013 I just gave her a new haircut, and she now has a mullet, which is very funny. (Laughter.) It just makes people laugh so much.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter.) You\u2019ve got to put that on the video.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah, I just laugh every time I look at her, but I feel like she\u2019s finally come to her true self.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Is she self-aware of the bad haircut or the mullet?\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t think so. I think all she can tell is that people look at her and they get very happy. (Laughter.) \n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, we have a shop dog, a brown standard poodle whose name is Douglas Fur. \n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah, good one.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: (Laughter.) Yeah, and Douglas knows when he\u2019s got a bad haircut.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Yeah? Oh, I don\u2019t think she knows. She just gets very excited about being so aerodynamic when I cut her short. Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s so awesome. Well, look, thank you so much for taking time to chat with us today, and thank you for what you do. It\u2019s just great stuff.\n\nSIMONE GIERTZ: Thank you so much. Yeah, and thanks for watching all my videos. It\u2019s not just for research for this podcast. It means a lot.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, for sure. \n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right. That was Kevin\u2019s interview with Simon Giertz. I thought it was really, really great. I mean, she\u2019s incredible, right? Like, the stuff that she does, as you said at the top of the show, she\u2019s a great example for so many people out there. But what was amazing to me is how she\u2019s just so kind of fearless to give things a try. And that attitude, I think, about learning and exploring and trying things out is just really, really, I think, rare to see people do it the way that she has, and also, really awesome just to see the results where she\u2019s saying, well, if other people can do this, why can\u2019t I try? I don\u2019t think we have enough of that in this world.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I totally agree. We have so many people, and, like, I do this myself sometimes. Like, I have, over and over again in my own life, sort of looked at things and said, oh, I don\u2019t understand how this works. And like, I think it\u2019s too complicated for me to understand. And, like, that \u2013 that is \u2013 you can certainly live your life that way, but, like, it\u2019s so much more interesting when you just can focus your curiosity on a thing, like figure out what makes it tick, like, what must the people who made it have been thinking when they created the thing; and then just giving yourself permission to tinker around and to try to replicate people\u2019s results or make brand new things that have never existed before yourself.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, I totally agree with you. I have a tendency sometimes to do the same thing where I think something is too hard, and I don\u2019t want to even attempt it because I\u2019m just like, well, there\u2019s no way I could figure it out. But hearing Simone talk and thinking about it and thinking, no, I\u2019m going to go ahead and I\u2019m going to learn to actually fix my own plumbing if I want to, you know?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: It\u2019s inspiring, actually. I wanted to ask you, you know, when did your, I guess, love of making start? Did it start as a kid or has this been something that\u2019s come about more as you\u2019ve gotten older and as you know, you\u2019ve done other things and been exposed to people like Simone?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It did start when I was a kid. Like, I was always super, super curious about how things worked. I was, you know, the bane of my mother\u2019s existence when I was a little kid, because I was the four year old that was trying to take things apart and shove metal objects in light sockets and all sorts of, like, highly, highly dangerous and destructive sorts of things. \n\nBut, you know, the thing that I did when I was younger, is I just sort of put these weird constraints on my making. Like, I would just convince myself that, oh, I only know how to do this and I can\u2019t do this other stuff. So, like, for a very long time, like I \u2013 the story that I told myself is I am not mechanically inclined. And \u2013 and so, like, oh my God, it\u2019s so much easier to make things with software than it is to, like, make things with, like, physical things. \n\nAnd then I you know, I\u2019d done some woodworking stuff when I was a kid and I became a more serious woodworking hobbyist, you know, as an adult. But even then, it\u2019s like, oh, well, I\u2019m only a woodworker. Like, I can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t do this other stuff. And, like, the thing that I\u2019ve just learned over time is that, yeah, you can \u2013 you can teach yourself how to do anything. And when you have more tools in your arsenal, you can do more really interesting, creative things.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah. No, I think that\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s a great point. And I think what\u2019s great about what\u2019s happening now, what we didn\u2019t have access to before, is we have this community of makers, people like Simone, who are making this amazing content and teaching others, and giving them ideas and showing off what it looks like, which is empowering. It really is, for people who might not know where to get started or might be afraid of doing something wrong, having those guides out there for us is just really awesome.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hundred percent. I mean, we should all be just incredibly grateful with how generous all these makers are, that they are sharing what they do with all of us and teaching us, like, what their creativity looks like. Even if, you know, we\u2019re just curious and never going to do things ourselves, like it\u2019s still just an incredible act of generosity on their behalf.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: No, you\u2019re completely correct. And I think that goes for all types of art, which making definitely is. We\u2019re very fortunate to have so many generous people, as you say, sharing with us, and Simone is definitely one of them. \n\nAll right. Well, that is all the time we have for today.
