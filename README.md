## Overview

BenchmarkQED is a suite of tools designed for automated benchmarking of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, particularly in the context of answering questions over private datasets. It provides components for query generation, evaluation, and dataset preparation to facilitate rigorous testing.

### AutoQ

AutoQ generates synthetic queries ranging from local to global, facilitating consistent benchmarking across datasets without user customization. 

### AutoE

AutoE evaluates answers based on comprehensiveness, diversity, empowerment, and relevance, utilizing the LLM-as-a-Judge method for scaling evaluations.

### AutoD
The AutoD component ensures consistent dataset sampling and summarization, which aids in creating comparable AutoQ queries and supporting consistent evaluations in AutoE. 

### Datasets

BenchmarkQED also provides access to datasets, including the Behind the Tech podcast transcripts and AP News articles, to support the development of RAG systems and AI question-answering.
