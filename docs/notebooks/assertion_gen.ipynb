    "## Notes on Assertion Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use this approach:**\n",
    "- You have existing questions that were generated with `max_assertions=0` or without assertion generation\n",
    "- You want to add evaluation capabilities to previously generated question sets\n",
    "- You need to regenerate assertions with different parameters or improved prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Requirements:**\n",
    "- Questions must have `claims` in their `attributes` field\n",
    "- For data-local questions: claims should be a list of claim dictionaries\n",
    "- For data-global questions: claims can be in various formats (simple or complex)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Format:**\n",
    "- Assertions are added to the question's `attributes.assertions` field\n",
    "- Each assertion contains a `statement` that can be used for evaluation\n",
    "- Questions without valid claims are left unchanged\n",
    "\n",
    "**Configuration Options:**\n",
    "- `max_assertions`: Maximum number of assertions to generate per question (default: 10)\n",
    "- `batch_size`: For global questions, controls how many claims are processed together\n",
    "- `concurrent_coroutines`: Controls parallel processing for global questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Handling:**\n",
    "- Questions without claims are skipped with a warning message\n",
    "- Individual failures are logged but don't stop the overall process"
