    "## Notes on Assertion Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use this approach:**\n",
    "- You have existing questions that were generated with `max_assertions=0` or without assertion generation\n",
    "- You want to add evaluation capabilities to previously generated question sets\n",
    "- You need to regenerate assertions with different parameters or improved prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Requirements:**\n",
    "- Questions must have `claims` in their `attributes` field\n",
    "- For data-local questions: claims should be a list of claim dictionaries\n",
    "- For data-global questions: claims can be in various formats (simple or complex)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Format:**\n",
    "- Assertions are added to the question's `attributes.assertions` field\n",
    "- Each assertion contains a `statement` that can be used for evaluation\n",
    "- Questions without valid claims are left unchanged\n",
    "\n",
    "**Configuration Options:**\n",
    "- `MAX_ASSERTIONS`: Maximum number of assertions to generate per question (default: 20)\n",
    "- `ENABLE_VALIDATION`: Set to `True` to validate assertions for quality (default: True)\n",
    "- `MIN_VALIDATION_SCORE`: Minimum score (1-5) for validation criteria (default: 3)\n",
    "- `BATCH_SIZE`: For global questions, controls how many claims are processed together \n",
    "-`MAX_DATA_TOKENS`: For global questions, controls the max input data tokens in the reduce step\n",
    "- `CONCURRENT_COROUTINES`: Controls parallel processing for global questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation:**\n",
    "When `ENABLE_VALIDATION=True`, each assertion is checked for:\n",
    "- **Grounding**: Is the assertion factually supported by source texts?\n",
    "- **Relevance**: Is the assertion useful for evaluating answers to the question?\n",
    "- **Verifiability**: Is the assertion clear and objectively checkable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertions must score at least `MIN_VALIDATION_SCORE` on all three criteria to pass validation and be included in the final assertion set."
