---ROLE---

You are a helpful assistant that consolidates multiple assertions into fewer, higher-level thematic assertions for global question-answering evaluation.


---GOAL---

Given a global query and a list of initial assertions generated from claims, consolidate them into a smaller set of high-level thematic assertions that comprehensively cover the same topics while reducing redundancy and creating broader thematic categories.

---INSTRUCTIONS---

Each consolidated assertion should be a high-level, thematic statement that adheres to the following rules:

1. **Thematic Grouping**: Group related assertions by theme, topic, or conceptual area to create broader thematic categories.

2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensure that all important aspects from the initial assertions are preserved in the consolidated set - no critical topics should be lost.

3. **Higher-Level Abstraction**: Create assertions that are more abstract and comprehensive than the originals, focusing on major thematic dimensions rather than specific details.

4. **Reduced Redundancy**: Merge overlapping or similar assertions to eliminate duplication while maintaining complete coverage.

5. **Clear Testability**: Each consolidated assertion should be verifiable with a simple YES/NO criteria.

6. **Atomicity**: Each consolidated assertion should test a single, coherent thematic concept. Avoid combining multiple distinct evaluation criteria that should be tested separately.

7. **Conciseness**: Keep assertions brief and focused. Aims for under 50 words. Avoid long lists of examples or detailed enumerations within the assertion statement.

8. **Optimal Count**: Create up to ${max_assertions} consolidated assertions that provide comprehensive coverage of all the important themes present in the initial assertions. Use fewer assertions if that provides better thematic coherence and avoids forcing unnatural groupings.

Each consolidated assertion should contain the following elements:
- "statement": A high-level thematic assertion that begins with "The response should address" or "The response should discuss" followed by a broad thematic area.
- "sources": A list of the original assertions IDs that were consolidated into this thematic assertion.
- "score": An integer score between 0-100 indicating the importance of this thematic area (typically high since these represent consolidated important themes).

**EXAMPLES**:

**Original Assertions** → **Consolidated Assertion**:
- "Address economic impacts on businesses" + "Discuss financial consequences for industry" → "The response should address economic and financial impacts across affected sectors"
- "Discuss environmental regulations in California" + "Address environmental policy in Texas" + "Discuss environmental rules in Florida" → "The response should address environmental regulatory approaches across different states"

**GOOD (Concise)**:
- "The response should address regulatory approaches to environmental protection"
- "The response should discuss economic impacts of policy changes"
- "The response should address stakeholder perspectives on the measures"

**AVOID (Too Long)**:
- "The response should address regulatory approaches to environmental protection, including water quality standards, air pollution controls, hazardous waste management, and oversight of industrial facilities"
- "The response should discuss the various economic impacts of policy changes on businesses, industries, workers, consumers, and local communities"

The response should be JSON formatted as follows:
{
    "assertions": [
        {"statement": "The response should address...", "sources": [list of original assertion IDs], "score": importance score (0-100)},
        {"statement": "The response should discuss...", "sources": [list of original assertion IDs], "score": importance score (0-100)}
    ]
}


---QUERY---
$question_text


---INITIAL ASSERTIONS---
$assertions_context

---MAX NUMBER OF OUTPUT ASSERTIONS---
Up to ${max_assertions}

The response should be JSON formatted as follows:
{
    "assertions": [
        {"statement": "The response should address...", "sources": ["original assertion 1", "original assertion 2", ...], "score": importance score (0-100)},
        {"statement": "The response should discuss...", "sources": ["original assertion 1", "original assertion 2", ...], "score": importance score (0-100)}
    ]
}
