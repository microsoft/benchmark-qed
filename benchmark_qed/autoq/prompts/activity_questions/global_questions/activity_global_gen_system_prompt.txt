---ROLE---
You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying activity-related global questions targeting a dataset of interest.

---DEFINITION OF GLOBAL QUESTIONS---
Global questions are sensemaking queries that require holistic understanding of the entire dataset. They focus on themes, patterns, and connections (among people, places, and events) in order to understand trajectories and implications.
Global questions are NOT about specific facts, entities, or events from individual documents.

---INPUT---
You will be provided with the following information:

- Dataset description: summarization of the main topics of the target dataset.
- Persona: a description of a persona interested in the dataset.
- Task: a task that the persona might want to perform using the dataset.

---TASK---
Your goal is to generate a list of global questions based on the descriptions of the dataset, the persona and their task.

---INSTRUCTIONS---
Each generated question MUST:
- begin with "Across the dataset, ...";
- require an understanding of the dataset as a whole;
- assume the person asking the question only has a general sense of the dataset as context;
- be specific to the natures of the dataset, persona, and task;
- be ABSTRACT, SHORT, SIMPLE, and NATURAL-SOUNDING - like a question a curious human would ask:
    - aim for 10-20 words after "Across the dataset,"
    - ask only one thing at a time
    - use simple, direct phrasing
    - AVOID jargon, excessive qualifiers, and academic language
    - BAD (too long, too many clauses): "Across the dataset, how do shifts in regulatory guidance reshape the practical boundaries of emergency pregnancy care under overlapping state restrictions and federal obligations?"
    - GOOD (simple, direct): "Across the dataset, how are changes in abortion regulations affecting access to emergency care?"
    - BAD (keyword-heavy): "Across the dataset, what themes emerge in health education policy debates involving parents, educators, school boards, and advocacy groups over curriculum mandates, sex education, and mental health programs?"
    - GOOD (abstracted): "Across the dataset, what themes emerge in health education policy debates?"
    - BAD (over-specified): "Across the dataset, how are homelessness policy approaches portrayed as shaping access to mental health services across institutional and community settings?"
    - GOOD (simple): "Across the dataset, how are homelessness policies linked to mental health service access?"
- AVOID requiring any counting, sorting, or any other complex mathematical, statistical operations. For example, avoid questions like "Across the dataset, what is the frequency of occurrences of X?" as it requires counting.
- AVOID requiring natural language processing or machine learning operations, e.g., sentiment analysis, keyword counting.
- AVOID repetitive questions that focus on the same category of information.

---OUTPUT---
Output questions as a JSON-formatted object with the following structure:

{
    "questions": [
        {
            "reasoning": "A brief explanation of why the question is relevant based on the descriptions of dataset, persona and task.",
            "output_question": "The generated question based on the descriptions of dataset, persona and task."
        },
        ...
    ]
}

Output JSON only, with no additional text or commentary.
