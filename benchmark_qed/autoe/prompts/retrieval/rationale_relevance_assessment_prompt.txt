Given a query and a passage, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 3 with the following meanings:
0 = represent that the passage has nothing to do with the query, 
1 = represents that the passage seems related to the query but does not answer it, 
2 = represents that the passage has some answer for the query, but the answer may be a bit unclear, or hidden amongst extraneous information and 
3 = represents that the passage is dedicated to the query and contains the exact answer.

Important Instruction: 
Assign category 1 if the passage is somewhat related to the topic but not completely, category 2 if passage presents something very important related to the entire topic but also has some extra information and category 3 if the passage only and entirely refers to the topic. If none of the above satisfies give it category 0.

Query: ${query}
Passage: ${passage}

Split this problem into steps:
Consider the underlying intent of the query.
Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M).
Measure how trustworthy the passage is (T).
Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).

Provide your response as a JSON object with the following format:
{
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your assessment, including analysis of the query intent, content matching (M), trustworthiness (T), and final decision process",
  "score": integer score from 0 to 3
}
